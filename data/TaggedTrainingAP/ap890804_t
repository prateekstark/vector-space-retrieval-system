 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> to Memorial Stadium Friday night to watch their eldest son's American League baseball team, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, play the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the 43 year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman who heads the partnership that purchased the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, and his wife <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> joined his parents behind home plate in the skybox of <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>' owner <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. Before the game, the president, baseball Commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> and American League President <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> visited the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>' and then the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>' locker rooms. The president and first lady left with the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> batting in the bottom of the sixth inning and the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> ahead 6-2. The <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> ended up 6-4 losers. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said earlier it would be hard for the president to decide for whom to root.

His son's Rangers began the evening in fourth place in the American League West with a record of 57-49, two more victories than the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> have in their weaker division. On a humid 91-degree night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shed his jacket and tie to watch the game in a white short-sleeved shirt. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who arrived earlier in the day from the family's vacation home at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, wore a belted red tunic over a black skirt Their son, also in shirt sleeves, wore a blue <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> cap. All three waved to the crowd before the game. The president and his wife drew cheers, but his son was hooted when he waved the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> cap. All drank large sodas; the president had peanuts and he and his wife also had corn on the cob. The president took time out to autograph some baseballs and occasionally they used binoculars to follow the action. The Bushes also were accompanied by <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON>, an usher in the White House residence.

<HEAD>Piedmont Pilot Says Not a Hero For Landing Crippled Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pilot who brought a crippled <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet to a safe landing with one engine cowl scraping the ground said Thursday he's tried since to think of a better way of bringing in the plane. `` I landed that aircraft probably a thousand times last night to see if I could have done any better _ and I could n't,'' pilot <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> said during a news conference Thursday at <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> Triad International Airport. Flight 1489 originated at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and was bound for <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, with a stop in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. It was diverted to <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> when the crew could n't get the left landing gear down. <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> said he decided to go to <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> to avoid the more congested Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> said he liked the emergency equipment at <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> and knew <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>'s runway was as long as <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>'s He also knew a large contingent of <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> people were close by. <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> set the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 down on its right and nose landing gear, then settled the plane onto its left engine and skidded to a halt on the 10,000-foot runway, a shower of sparks coming from the dragging metal. `` I hardly knew that the wheel was n't there when we touched down,'' <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> said he had no previous experience like Wednesday's in his 21 years of flying for <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>. `` I always wondered what I would do if it did happen,'' he said. Passengers aboard <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> Flight 1489, which made the landing at <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Triad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said later they thought Fuda was a hero. `` There was no hysteria,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a lobbyist who says he flies a lot. `` But there were a lot of trips to the bathroom.'' <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, said her husband does n't think of himself as a hero. `` He's just glad it worked out,'' she said. `` The whole crew did just what they were supposed to do. He says he does n't consider himself a hero.'' `` This time it worked out the way it was supposed to work. Sometimes the crew does the right things and things do n't work out as well,'' she said. `` He's pooped. I've been giving him kisses and hugs since he got home.'' Fuda was not originally scheduled to pilot Flight 1489, said his neighbor <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> pilot. `` He was supposed to work Friday night, but they're having a ` Farewell to <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>' party in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Friday night, and he wanted to go to that. So he just picked up a flight that somebody dropped.'' `` I'm waiting to see the pilot I picked it up from,'' <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> said. The party is to celebrate Piedmo n't final flight on Saturday before its merger with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> is completed _ to which <PERSON> Fuda </PERSON> made jocular reference: `` I have made my last and best landing for <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>,'' he said. The 94 passengers and six crew members safely jumped down emergency chutes. A rubber wheel chock found wedged in the wheel well had prevented the left main landing gear from deploying, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said Thursday it would be mere speculation to suggest that the chock, a triangular rubber block 30 inches long and 6 inches high used to keep planes from rolling when they're parked, was left in the wheel well at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> National. `` There's really nothing else to say,'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> added. `` The airplane's in the hangar, and we estimate it to be in service Saturday.'' Only the left engine housing was damaged during the landing, <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. The 11-month-old plane's left wing and skin were unharmed. The plane's engine housing is designed to hold up during that type of emergency landing, he said. `` Apparently, -LRB- the wing -RRB- never touched the ground,'' he said. `` The engine itself is apparently undamaged, but we will remove it and replace it and run it through a complete structural check as well.'' <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> air safety investigator, said investigators found the chock wedged between two wheels on the left landing gear. While airline officials doubt the chock was deliberately placed, they declined to rule out any possibility pending further investigation, <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in Friday editions quoted <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as saying the right landing gear might also have been obstructed. Two bent hydraulic lines were found in the right wheel well, raising the possiblity that a chock might also have been stuck in the right landing gear and fallen out, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should warn <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that support of terrorism in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will result in a military strike, said the ground force commander in the ill-fated 1980 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hostage rescue attempt.

 Here is a state-by-state look at wildfires burning in the West: <LOCATION> IDAHO </LOCATION>: Hundreds of lightning-caused fires have joined to form huge blazes in forests in the western and central part of the state, burning 98,000 acres by Thursday. Cool, moist weather overnight helped firefighting efforts. Although warmer weather is predicted for the weekend, fire bosses say there is little chance of the lightning that sparked many of the fires 12 days earlier. <LOCATION> OREGON </LOCATION>: Fires east of the <LOCATION> Cascades </LOCATION> have burned more than 93,000 acres. About 650 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, were brought in to help fight a 13,300-acre blaze in the Monument Rock Wilderness, 70 miles southwest of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. A 23,300-acre fire burned on the boundary of the Eagle Cap Wildneress area northwest of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <LOCATION> CALIFORNIA </LOCATION>: More than 35,000 acres have burned, and the biggest active blaze was a brushfire in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The 10,800-acre blaze was 60 percent contained, but was burning toward rough terrain three miles from the <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, which houses the nation's largest optical telescope. Scientists were forced to shut down the observatory Thursday for fear that ash would damage the instrument. <LOCATION> MONTANA </LOCATION>: An 800-acre blaze in the <ORGANIZATION> Custer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was contained, but a fire on the Crow Indian Reservation southeast of Billings quickly spread to 500 acres and threatened two mountain cabins. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION>: Crews were mopped up an 850-acre forest fire in the Pasayten Wilderness near the Canadian border.

 House Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said today the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman threatening to expand allegations of possible misconduct against him is `` almost irrational.'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> on Thursday made public a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee in which he predicted his original complaint `` may have only scratched the surface.'' `` There could well be over 200 additional instances of potentially unethical, illegal or criminal conduct by Mr. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said, declining to give reporters specific information on the allegations. `` I think in terms of the substance of the charges you have an almost irrational Democrat in <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who is wandering around wildly saying things and I am comfortable after the ethics committee investigates it that they are going to say there is nothing to the charges,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who filed charges that led to the resignation of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker, said `` a number of very powerful Democrats said they were going to destroy me, that they would get even and, in that sense, of course I'm battling for my -LRB- political -RRB- life.'' In an interview Thursday with <ORGANIZATION> WAGA-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> lawmaker said: `` When you hear a politician say he has 200 hidden charges he may eventually file, you know he has a lot of baloney.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said he would n't file an expanded complaint against <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> until at least September. His April complaint to the ethics committee focused on an investment partnership formed by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> to promote a book he wrote with his wife and another person. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of possibly violating campaign finance law, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limitations on outside income and a rule prohibiting receipt of gifts from people with a direct interest in legislation. The ethics panel has hired a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> law firm to recommend whether it should begin a formal investigation. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said other allegations could involve: _ The possible failure of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> to disclose substantial, and potentially illegal, campaign contributions he made through his campaign committee during 1986 _ Information that contributors to the book promotion partnership were `` recipients of substantial federal grants and loan guarantees, including at least one major award under the politically controlled housing programs mal-administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. _ The propriety of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s management of a former political action committee that may have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for candidates, but only donated a miniscule portion of the money to those running for office _ Use of official stationery and congressional free mailing to promote the personal business endeavors of friends _ Improper settlement of personal and corporate debts incurred by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s campaign committee and the possibility that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> improperly enriched himself in a questionable real estate transaction

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said today they will consider making a hostage exchange with Shiite Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if they provide a list of prisoners they want freed from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jails. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was `` waiting for proposals'' from the Shiites. ... `` We hope we will get some proposals and it will be the end of the crisis.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was awaiting the specific list of prisoners whose freedom the Shiites seek. The list was promised in a statement from a militant Shiite faction in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Thursday night. After the faction, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday suspended its threat to kill <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will examine the demands `` on a positive basis.'' The `` freezing'' of the death threat came just minutes before a deadline set by the group for killing <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> unless <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> handed over the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> clergyman it kidnapped last week from his home in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Another Shiite Moslem faction that was holding Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> hostage said it killed him Monday because the clergyman, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, was not freed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was moving closer to starting negotiations to free three captured <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Israeli said it abducted <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> on July 28 hoping to swap him for the three soldiers. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said it will also try to secure the release of 16 Western hostages, including <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> and seven other Americans. Earlier today, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> discussed with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> the demands made by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, an offshoot of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who is also vice premier, was asked after a meeting with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was actively involved in the process. `` I'm hopeful,'' he replied In its first statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> group demand that <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> be freed. After suspending the threat to kill <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, it also demanded that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> release `` a number of'' Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners. While the statement did not mention <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s offer to exchange <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> prisoners for Israeli POWs and foreign hostages, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and commentators saw the halting of the threatened killing of <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> as a sign the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> radicals were ready to deal. `` If indeed there are real grounds for the report on a proposal for prisoners exchange, we shall examine it on a positive basis,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Thursday night. Israeli officials noted the Shiite demands did not mention the Israeli air force navigator and two soldiers believed held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, and said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s statement was meant to solicit a specific response regarding them. <PERSON> Akiva </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldar </PERSON>, a leading columnist for the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials were not taking seriously demands to release prisoners from the 19-month Palestinian uprising, which could include more than 8,000 detainees. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told an American Jewish group that any negotiations would be complicated and lengthy, and an army general who managed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s last prisoner exchange said it would take `` a long time and great patience'' to make a deal. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nativ </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that the process would begin with unreasonable Shiite demands and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would counter with insistence on first seeing the three soldiers believed held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> or allied factions. <PERSON> Nativ </PERSON> was in charge of negotiations that led to the exchange of three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. He said any negotiations over the 16 Western hostages would be more complicated because other countries were involved. The longest-held hostage is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
 The first senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official to visit <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> since its 1974 Marxist revolution arrived today for talks on this nation's 27-year civil war and stability in the Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, told reporters after arriving that he has `` a long agenda of issues'' he is prepared to discuss `` in a frank and fair manner.'' He is to spend two days in this strategic but impoverished nation that is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s staunchest ally on the continent. That friendship with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> soured once-warm relations between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> after President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> and a clique of fellow military officers ousted the Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> in 1974 and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> became <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s biggest patron in 1977. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was expected to meet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayih </PERSON> this afternoon and <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday before leaving Sunday for <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. He said that besides <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s civil war and regional conflicts he plans to discuss economic issues and the return of refugees in the region. He also was expected to discuss money the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> still owes from weapons it purchased years ago. Discussions on economic growth will be handicapped by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws that deny development aid to countries that owe money for arms and are accused of human rights abuses. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s visit comes a day after <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> published a report charging that <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is among the worst offenders in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in failing to ratify international human rights covenants. The London-based organization's report said thousands of suspected political opponents in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> are imprisoned for months or even years without trial and that many are tortured. Others vanish without explanation, it said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s concern for refugees involves hundreds of thousands who have fled wars in neighboring <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and are living in refugee camps in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, while large numbers of Ethiopians have fled to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to escape their country's northern civil war. Ethiopian refugees also remain in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, where they fled a decade ago after Ethiopian troops backed by Soviets and Cubans repulsed a Somali invasion. The American official's visit comes after several appeals from <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION> for improved relations.

 Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says he will press on with his proposal to require new oil tankers to be built with double hulls despite its narrow rejection by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were close and there is no stopping me now,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., said Thursday following the 51-49 vote to table, and thus reject, his amendment to a pending bill tightening oil tanker safety regulations and creating a special fund to clean up oil spills <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' amendment would have required double hulls and double sides on all new tankers over 20,000 deadweight tons that operate in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said today that its crackdown on dissent will not endanger intellectuals, but it also announced that a prominent dissident holed up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has been fired from an academic board. Also today, the government declined to comment on a report that senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is seriously ill with prostate cancer. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> office described the report as a mere rumor. An unsigned commentary in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will continue to respect its intellectuals' knowledge and talent, even though some participated in the recent pro-democracy movement that the government calls a `` counter-revolutionary rebellion `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needs a strong intellectual force for modernization. ... We should thoroughly implement <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s policy to ` respect knowledge, respect talent' and use intellectuals to achieve the modernization goal,'' it said. The crackdown ended a period of relatively free political debate. Chinese now are urged to report on friends and family and must participate in political study sessions reminiscent of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. The commentary called those who took part in the student movement `` scum'' and `` enemies of the party and of the people.'' It said, `` It is in the interest of the workers, peasants and intellectuals to punish them.'' `` Those who were under the influence of the wave of bourgeois liberalism ... will elevate their understanding and continue to make contributions'' to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modernization program, the commentary said. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, the dissident who evaded arrest by seeking refuge at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, has been relieved of his position on the <ORGANIZATION> Academic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Degrees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> under the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cabinet, is no longer qualified to tutor doctoral students, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who entered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy with his wife shortly after the June crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, already had been relieved of his posts at the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dialectics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> but apparently still retains his main job at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Observatory </LOCATION>. Several other dissident intellectuals also have been removed from peripheral positions. The government issued arrest warrants for <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife, professor of physics <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, for allegedly inciting the pro-democracy protests, and has demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> turn them over to Chinese authorities. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on the report by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is seriously ill with prostate cancer. Quoting unidentified Chinese sources, the Japanese news agency said the senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader's condition had suddenly worsened a few days ago. Emergency medical personnel were sent to care for him at his summer resort near <LOCATION> Bo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jiji </PERSON> said. An employee at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said he had received many queries about <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s health but could respond. There was no answer tonight at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s news office. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was last seen in public June 9, when national television showed him congratulating top army officers on having ended the pro-democracy protests. He spoke in a strong voice and appeared more alert and healthy than he had for some months. He is widely believed to suffer from prostate problems, and over the past few years there have been periodic reports he is very ill or dying. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily today said the army has chosen 36 people to travel around the country to `` tell the whole nation how they, bearing the fate of the party and the country, protected the socialist system'' by helping troops crack down on the popular student movement. The group includes soldiers, armed police and a woman who said they helped 164 soldiers hide from angry protesters. The move is part of a campaign to publicize the official version of the events of June 3-4, when troops marched through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and fired on unarmed civilians to drive student protesters from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Various forms of segregation that isolate blacks in major cities, depriving them of opportunities and resources, are creating a separate society of underachievers, researchers say. The authors of a study released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> call such multi-layer discrimination `` hypersegregation.'' Professors <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> say they found that hypersegregation exists in 10 cities, and that those cities account for 29 percent of the country's urban black population. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was found to be the most hypersegregated city. `` There is a small set of cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where blacks experience more extreme segregation than believed in the past,'' said <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, a professor of sociology and director of the school's <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` While the cities are small in number, they house a relatively large percentage of blacks.'' In the study _ published in today's editions of Demography, the journal of Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> focused on five measures of segregation: _ The degree to which neighborhood percentages of minority-group residents correspond to the citywide minority percentages. _ The degree of potential contact between whites and members of the minority group where the latter live and work. _ The extent to which minority neighborhoods are clustered. _ The degree to which minorities are settled in and around the city center. _ The amount of physical space occupied by a minority group. Hypersegregation occurs when at least four of those measures apply, <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. Using data gathered in 1980 by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the researchers used the five measures to compute housing patterns for blacks and Hispanics in 60 metropolitan areas. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, blacks had an index above .750 on each of the five measures. A reading of .600 is considered high, researchers say. The study found hypersegregation of blacks in nine other cities: <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, Ind.; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The researchers found no hypersegregation of Hispanics in the nation's urban areas. Housing patterns that fall into any one of the five categories are troublesome because they isolate a minority group from amenities, opportunities and resources that affect social and economic well-being, the researchers said. Language is the best and most sensitive indicator of social isolation and creation of a divergent cultures, <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. `` Black English vernacular is becoming more prevalent and almost a separate language,'' he noted. `` It has its own diction and structure, and it is because of isolation. The two groups do n't interact They are not sharing a common language.'' The demographics of blacks and whites are different, with blacks having a higher infant mortality rate and a shorter life expectancy, <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. Black child-bearing is concentrated between ages 18 and 25, while whites generally delay having children until later in life. `` It is like living in two different nations,'' <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. Hispanics experienced lower degrees of segregation overall. The differences in treatment of the two minority groups are not easily explained by socioeconomic factors, he said _ which leaves racism. `` Hispanics are primarily white,'' he said. `` They are apparently more accepted as neighbors than blacks. There is something about blacks that disturbs whites. It is a complex psychological process.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, today said he would help find a solution to the hostage situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and urged the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to approach the problem in a reasonable manner, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. `` These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems,'' the president said during his weekly prayer sermon at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Come let us approach the problem reasonably. We too will help solve the problems there, so the people of the region can live in peace and harmony,'' he said in the broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` I tell the White House, the problem of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has solutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must take the initiative by pressuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem cleric it kidnapped from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> a week ago. If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> responds by saying it can not do so, `` this is n't acceptable to us,'' he said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to swap <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> for the 16 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held there. The pro-Iranian group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is reputed to be a member, rejected such a swap. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the foreign hostages. On Thursday, one of those factions, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, suspended a threat to kill American hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> but demanded that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Lebanese prisoners it holds. It did not say what would happen if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused. On Monday, another faction, the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, claimed it killed American hostage <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. `` We do not make any judgment about the group which executed the American colonel,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. `` You can not condemn the innocent people of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> ... on the vague basis that some group has possibly killed someone -LRB- <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> -RRB- for a crime,'' he added. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' captors accused him of being a spy. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, known as a pragmatist who wants to improve <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s ties with the West, has not said whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> played a role in the reprieve granted <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> A knowledgeable Shiite Moslem source in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the final word on <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s reprieve came from him. The 54-year-old <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is believed to want to end the international terrorist image <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> developed under the leadership of the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death June 3, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> moved quickly to gain the upper hand against a radical faction headed by Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>.

 Rescuers crawled on their hands and knees today to reach the site of an Olympic Airways crash, but they found no survivors from the aircraft that slammed into a mountain with 34 people aboard. The British-built Short plane crashed Thursday into 4,800-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kerkis </LOCATION> on Samos island. Airline officials blamed the accident on heavy fog that covered the mountain, the highest in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Rescuers searched for the flight recorders, which should contain information on the plane's equipment and any conversations involving the pilot. Transport and Communications Minister <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelestathis </PERSON> said the plane, which was flying to the island from <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, carried 31 passengers, including an infant, and three crew members. All were Greek. Rescuers said they apparently were killed instantly when the aircraft hit the mountain. `` Unfortunately, we could do nothing, I checked every body I could find,'' said <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlas </PERSON>, a doctor from a village on this eastern <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> island within sight of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s southwestern coast. The propeller-driven plane gave no sign of trouble before it disappeared from radar screens, officials said. Only a wing and twin-tail section of the aircraft was recognizable. The front disintegrated on impact and was just a black scar on the mountainside. Police could identify only four of the charred bodies. Olympic, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s national carrier, was flying in relatives to help identify victims. Helicopters could not land close to the crash site and rescuers crawled up the mountainside on hands and knees for 90 minutes in the dark. The steep terrain prevented them from carrying down the dead. `` We'll have the helicopters hoist out the human remains, `` said police officer <PERSON> Panayiotis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourdonouris </PERSON>. Officials ruled out foul play as the cause of the crash. An Olympic official who spoke on condition of anonymity said: `` It appears that thick fog in the area at the time played the villain's role as the pilot flew blindly into the mountain.'' <PERSON> Gelestathis </PERSON> told lawmakers in Parliament today that a terrorist act was out of the question. Military teams were dispatched to the crash site after a shepherd reported seeing an explosion on the mountain. The <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport duty officer, <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fragiadakis </PERSON>, said the control tower lost contact with the plane at about 4:55 p.m., an hour after it left <LOCATION> Salonika </LOCATION>. It was scheduled to land on Samos at 5:30 p.m. The plane disappeared from radar screens when it was 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Samos </LOCATION>. Olympic officials said the pilot, <PERSON> Petros </PERSON> <PERSON> Moutzoureas </PERSON>, was a veteran with an excellent flight record. They said the aircraft was bought in 1981 and was used for inter-island flights.

<TEXT>
 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces battled with howitzers, mortars and tank cannons across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line today. Police said two people were killed and seven wounded. The shelling kept many Moslems from attending their weekly Friday prayers. The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 516 killed and 2,183 wounded in the 20-week-old confrontation between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> troops and Syrian soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` They've started early today,'' grocer <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> said as he closed his store in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and headed for a bomb shelter. `` What a life! We are living under the ground like the dead. We might as well die.'' A police spokesman, who can not be named in line with regulations, said the clash involved the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> district of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Rummaneh </PERSON> and the adjacent Syrian-controlled Moslem neighborhood of <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>. He said the clash started with an exchange of sniper fire then developed into an artillery duel. It was not immediately clear who started the clash. Shells crashed into apartment buildings on both sides of the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, which has divided <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors since the civil war broke out in April 1975. The two fatalities occurred in the densely populated slum of <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>, a stronghold for the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia. Amal did not take part in the confrontation, the spokesman said. Shell explosions echoed across <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> and residents rushed to underground bomb shelters as calls were blared from mosque minarets for noon prayers. The police spokesman said the shelling of <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> did not reach the nearby slum of <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION>, where followers of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, attended prayers at the main mosque. Friday is the Moslem holy day. Syrian gunners deployed in <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> fired their 130mm Soviet-designed howitzers at the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Kfarshima </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces maintain some artillery batteries. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners, the spokesman said, responed by shelling <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> and the Druse suburb of <LOCATION> Choueifat </LOCATION> with 155mm U.S.-designed howitzers deployed northeast of the capital. The thuds of shell blasts resounded across the bomb-ravaged <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital, forcing the few businesses that opened early in the morning to close. Only 200,000 people of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s original 1.5 million population still live in the city, which has been the site of ferocious shelling duels since the confrontation broke out March 8. Most of the evacuees have settled in safer areas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the Christian-controlled mountain resorts northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The confrontation broke out over a blockade imposed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for denying the ailing state treasury about $ 100 million in lost customs dues annually. The Syrians and allied Moslem and leftist forces retaliated by shelling and besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, home to about one million people northeast of the capital. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 54, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, escalated the confrontation with the Syrians by declaring a `` war of liberation'' against their 40,000 troops, deployed in predominantly Moslem sections of the nation. An Arab mediation committee has failed to solve <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s crisis, rooted in an effort by the Moslem majority to wrest more power from Christians, who traditionally have dominated <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The panel blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for blocking a settlement.

 There's an athletic shoe company that urges, `` Just do it.'' But when it comes to losing weight, a federal study indicates that millions of hefty Americans just do n't. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that none of 32 states in a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> survey could report even half their overweight people taking the recommended twofold approach to losing weight: eating fewer calories and getting more exercise. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 34 million Americans _ about one in four adults _ are overweight by 20 percent or more. `` The data suggest that significant numbers are eating fewer calories, but it's the physical activity that we do n't have enough people doing,'' said <PERSON> Eddas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist. In the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> survey, conducted in 1987 in 32 states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, an average of 20 percent of the overweight men reported that they were following the fewer calories-more exercise approach. For women, the percentage was somewhat better: 31 percent. An average of 44 percent of the overweight men said they were eating fewer calories, compared with 64 percent of overweight women. But only 24 percent of the men and 35 percent of the women said they were increasing their physical activity. `` Physical activity appears to be the limiting factor,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> concluded in its weekly report. `` The low prevalence of increasing physical activity to lose weight may reflect the sedentary lifestyle of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults and the emphasis on diet as a means of weight loss without adequately addressing the benefits of physical activity.'' Overall, the percentage of overweight men trying both the low-calorie and more-exercise approach ranged from a high of 36 percent in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to a low of 13 percent in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. For women, the range was from 19 percent in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to 42 percent in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, with all percentages rounded. Ms. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> noted that an official 1990 health objective for the nation calls for at least half of overweight adults to follow the fewer calories-more exercise regimen. `` We're not going to meet that objective in any state,'' she said. Overweight is defined as being about 20 percent above ideal body weight for the person's age.

 President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today offered to help find a solution to the hostage situation but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to release a kidnapped Shiite Moslem cleric, Iranian media reported. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would explore the offer `` to the fullest'' but that he did not want to raise the hopes of the hostages' families. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also refused to confirm reports he had planned to take military action if another hostage had been killed. One hostage was reported killed Monday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, meanwhile, was awaiting a list of prisoners that a Shiite Moslem group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> wants freed. `` I tell the White House, the problem of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has solutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said in a speech carried on official <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. `` These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems. Come let us approach the problem reasonably. We too will help solve the problems there, so the people of the region can live in peace and harmony,'' he said in the broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s comments were made during the weekly Friday prayer session at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> freed, it must take the inititive by asking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem leader abducted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos one week ago. `` We do not make any judgment about the group which executed the American colonel,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said, referring to Monday's reported slaying of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> by the pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` But if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to take the inititative -LRB- in freeing hostages -RRB-, it must ask <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free the Friday prayer leader of Jibchit,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> responds by saying it can not pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into freeing the Moslem cleric, `` this is n't acceptable to us,'' he added. Israeli commandos last week stole into Jibchit, in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and kidnapped <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem clergyman who is the local prayer leader. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> also is reputed to be a spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 16 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> claimed it hanged <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to release <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> claims <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> instigated attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Another pro-Iranian group, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, threatened to kill another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, but announced Thursday it had suspended the death order. It also demanded that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> free not only <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> but also Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners `` within days.'' The group did not say if the death sentence would be restored if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not comply. There are eight Americans among the 16 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> was acting comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was abducted March 16, 1985. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if the latest developments suggested a break in the hostage crisis. `` I'm encouraged, but I do n't want to get the hopes of the hostages' loved ones up once again to have those hopes dashed,'' he said. He added that had been engaged in `` an extroardinarily broad exercise of diplomacy'' over the last several days on behalf of the hostages. Had another hostage been killed, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to target for attack the <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> base of 4,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The guards work closely with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Asked about the report, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded, `` If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the last place I'd be talking about it.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would examine the new demands `` on a positive basis.'' Four top <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders, including <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzkhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, met today in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to fashion a response to the Shiite radicals' demands A spokesman for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was awaiting the list of prisoners the Shiites want freed. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it was willing to transmit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the demands for the prisoner release. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to trade <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, 33, and other Lebanese Shiites it holds for foreign hostages and three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has rejected such a swap. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Na'im </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leader, said there had been no direct or indirect negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a prisoner exchange and would not be. The Revolutionary <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> granted <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> a reprieve 45 minutes before the deadline Thursday that it had set for killing him. It was the third time the group held off on its death threat. `` Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states with whom <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, we declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution with an initiative,'' said a statement by the group. None of the mediating nations was named, but press reports in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> have said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> were believed to have interceded. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> helped secure the release of American diplomats taken captive at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1979. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, known as a pragmatist, has not commented on whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> played a role, but a knowledgeable Shiite Moslem source in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the final word on <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s reprieve came from him. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is believed to want to improve ties with the West and to change <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s image as a sponsor of international terrorism.

 Throwing flowers, candy and coins, more than 1,000 cheering residents of this key <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port gave a riotous welcome today to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships cruising into <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>'s historic harbor. `` That's for ice cream when you come ashore,'' called one woman in the crowd as she lobbed a 20-kopeck coin toward the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors lined along the ships' decks in their blinding summer whites. The visiting seamen, who sent dozens of round sailor hats whizzing to the whistling, waving crowd, were equally excited. `` It just feels great to be making history,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlatt </PERSON>, medical officer aboard the cruiser USS Thomas S. Gates. The good-will port call by the <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and the frigate USS Kauffman mirrored a visit last month by three Soviet ships to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in the first such Soviet-American naval exchange in 14 years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sixth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship, the USS Belknap, also was to join but was diverted to be at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s disposal during the hostage crisis in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The ships' visit to <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> is the first since World War II. Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships docked in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in 1975. <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, normally is a closed city, even to Soviets. But today it opened its gates wide to greet the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors. Crewmen were mobbed by beaming Soviets, handed babies to kiss, asked to pose for snapshots and given rubles, souvenirs and food. A brass band played marches and two women in traditional costume met the ship with bread and salt, symbols of hospitality. `` My whole soul is happy that we finally did this great thing and that we will be friends,'' said 18-year-old <PERSON> Zinaida </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolisinchenko </PERSON>. `` And the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors, they are so attractive.'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zverev </PERSON>, the military commandant of <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>, look with bemusement at the crowd on the pier. `` We did n't expect so many people,'' he said. `` This is the biggest reception for a ship I have ever seen here.'' <PERSON> Zverev </PERSON> admitted the city is not accustomed to giving such an open welcome to Western guests, but said, `` it is appropriate given the state of our relations today.'' The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors, too, commented on the strange sensation of suddenly being treated as such good friends. Aviator <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Zentry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, recalled going through recognition training to learn how to pick out Soviet ships from afar. `` And now, here were are right next to them,'' he said. `` For so long we thought of them as possible adversaries, and all of a sudden that is gone in a minute,'' said public affairs officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weishautt </PERSON>. Above Count's Pier, where the American ships docked, a red banner proclaimed in English: `` Mutual understanding and trust between the people of the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> is the path to peace and security.'' The Americans will tour state farms, a vineyard, an art museum, an aquarium, a war museum, and naval installations. They will be entertained at concerts, eat meals aboard Soviet ships and play basketball, soccer and volleyball with their Soviet counterparts.

<HEAD>Austria Closes Its Investigation of Bloch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today it is closing its investigation of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat suspected of spying for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, after determining that `` <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s interests were not affected.'' However, Interior Minister <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeschnak </PERSON> also told Austrian radio that 10 politicians have been asked about their relationship with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> and that their answers will be forwarded to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for its investigation. The Austrian-born <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> served at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1980-87 and was friends with many politicians, including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>. In the radio interview, <PERSON> Loeschnak </PERSON> refused to identify the Austrian politicians asked to fill out questionnaires about their dealings with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. He also said that <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> is leaving it up to the politicians to respond at their own discretion. Some of the 10 have promised to comply, he said without identifying them. <PERSON> Loeschnak </PERSON> said police interviewed an Austrian woman with whom <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> had an extended friendship. But their questioning yielded no evidence that the woman suspected anything about <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s alleged spying activities, he said. No charges have been brought against <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who has been stripped of his diplomatic passport and placed on administrative leave. He is under constant surveillance in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, 54, reportedly had broad contacts with Austrian politicians and officials, and he regularly attended all kinds of diplomatic and other parties while he was economics chief at the embassy in 1980-83 and then the No. 2 until his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in July 1987. <PERSON> Loeschnak </PERSON> noted the American's contacts with the Austrian politicians `` have no -LRB- relevance -RRB- for <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s security interests.'' At a news conference July 28, <PERSON> Loeschnak </PERSON> said the suspicions against <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> are `` the affair of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> is the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat to be investigated under suspicion of collaborating with the Soviets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were alerted to <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s possible links with the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> when they intercepted an international telephone call arranging a meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in May. There, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was filmed exchanging briefcases with a man known as <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, whom the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> considers a Soviet spy. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> says he knows <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> as a stamp collector.

 The battle over abortion will involve young people today as the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War did in the 1960s, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> told female political activists today. `` Abortion is the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> of this nation for young people everywhere,'' <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> told the opening session of the National Women's Political Caucus' Biennial Convention. <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> representative from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and a founder of the caucus 18 years ago, was the first of several speakers who are expected to address the abortion issue. The caucus runs through Sunday. `` No civilized nation can be allowed to declare an unborn fetus a person under the Constitution before women are declared persons under the Constitution,'' <PERSON> Abzug </PERSON> said. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the steering committee that the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost a chance to win the 1988 presidential election by not doing more to garner votes from women. `` In fact, we blew a major gender gap that might have carried the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he understands `` the frustrations of working in the coalition.'' But he said those who counsel the formation of a third party `` ignore the second half of the adage that begins, ` United we stand.' `` No matter where the struggle for justice ... divided we will indeed fall and fail to reach our goals,'' he said. `` I have worked in the struggle for civil rights my entire adult life, and I do not deny the problems of advancing a cause through the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the steering committee of the National Women's Political Caucus. `` But the alternative is self-righteous failure. It may feel good when the first speeches are made, but it will be very, very tragic when the votes are counted.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters later that the creation of a women's political party probably would hurt Democrats more than Republicans, but he added, `` I do n't think it's going to hurt anybody because I do n't think it's going to happen. No action similar to NOW's is expected at the National Women's Political Caucus biennial convention, according to <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON>, head of the caucus The convention, which officially convened today, is expected to attract 1,500 delegates and guests. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also touched on the battle over abortion because of restrictions allowed under a July 3 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the right wing of this country threaten women's rights and all of our rights,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform supports the right of a woman to choose whether to have an abortion, as well as such proposals as an Equal Rights Amendment. An invitation to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to address the leaders of the non-partisan caucus was declined, <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The black homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> is intensifying its crackdown on two communities that have violently resisted incorporation into the territory, an anti-apartheid group said today. Also today, police imposed restrictions on the funeral of two slain activists in a township near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and reported a series of skirmishes between police and mixed-race youths. In other incidents, police said five blacks were killed in three separate clashes in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, where supporters of militant and relatively conservative political factions have engaged in a three-year power struggle claiming hundreds of lives. <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s four nominally independent homelands, has arrested a local leader, banned anti-apartheid groups and restricted a lawyer's access to people in the communities of <LOCATION> Braklaagte </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Leeuwfontein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kompe </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which is opposed to the tribal homeland system, said the <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> government `` is still increasing its efforts against its opponents'' in the two communities. The two neighboring villages were incorporated into the homeland on Jan. 1 despite protests by many of the estimated 25,000 residents. The residents of <LOCATION> Braklaagte </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Leeuwfontein </PERSON> say they want to remain part of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and fear they will be discriminated against by the <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> government because of their opposition to incorporation. The homelands are not recognized by any foreign countries. Eleven people, including nine policemen, were killed July 1 when authorities sought to break up a rally in <LOCATION> Leeuwfontein </LOCATION> arranged by residents who opposed joining <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. Thirty-three people charged with involvement in the fighting were to appear in a <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> court. <PERSON> Pupsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebogodi </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Braklaagte </LOCATION> community, has been arrested three times this year and remains in detention, said the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which was banned from <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> by the homeland government. Authorities have threatened to deport the Rev. <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, a German citizen and <PERSON> Luthern </PERSON> missionary who has served the Braklaagte community since 1981, Ms. <PERSON> Kompe </PERSON> said. A South African lawyer representing the defendants, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, has been ordered to apply for a visa before he can return to the homeland. The homeland has few formal border posts and usually no visa is required to visit. About 2 million blacks live in <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, which consists of seven separate pieces of land scattered across north-central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> regional police commissioner, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Flip </PERSON> <PERSON> Fourie </PERSON>, imposed restrictions on Saturday's funeral of two mixed-race activists who died in a bomb blast last month. Police said <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterwitch </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Coline </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 22, were trying to plant the bomb in a public toilet when it exploded. <PERSON> Fourie </PERSON> said the funeral service must take place indoors and be addressed only by ordained clergymen. He said mourners can not march to the cemetery and can not display any political posters, flags or banners.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, deliberating less than an hour and ignoring talk of a possible veto, today approved a $ 286.5 billion military spending bill that makes wholesale changes in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s defense program. By a vote of 312-105, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to adopt a spending plan that slashes nearly $ 2 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> from the president's request strictly limits the B-2 stealth bomber program and makes drastic cuts in the MX and <LOCATION> Midgetman </LOCATION> nuclear missiles. Despite the unusually rapid approval of the costly bill by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may veto the measure. And in advance of the vote, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget office said the president's senior advisers would recommend a veto on grounds the measure `` would severely compromise the administration's objective of providing adequate defense capabilities within constrained resources. `` They have conformed,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said of the appropriations measure that conforms to the separate defense authorization bill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted last week. `` But that still makes it veto-bait in my opinion.'' The bill, approved as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rushed to complete pending business before starting a month-long recess later today, slashed $ 2 billion from classified programs that include the advanced fighter and advanced cruise missile. The money bill also incorporates the cuts the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> made in the Star Wars anti-missile program, the B-2 stealth bomber and the MX and <LOCATION> Midgetman </LOCATION> nuclear missiles in the policy-setting authorization bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cut <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request of $ 4.9 billion for Star Wars by $ 1.8 billion, imposed strict limitation on production of the radar-evading B-2, trimmed $ 502 million from the $ 1.1 billion sought for the MX rail-garrison system and eliminated all $ 100 million sought for the Midgetman. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he hoped that when members of the the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meet early in September to craft a final version of the bill, the `` most egregious add-ons and deletions can be modified and limited to make it acceptable to the administration.'' But he said as they stand now, he does not support the authorization and appropriations bills and would recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto the legislation. `` I think it will be vetoed,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A government report today said a `` failure of police control'' led to the deaths of 95 people who were crushed in a surging crowd at a soccer match, and it recommended new safety measures for all stadiums. The 71-page report said authorities at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> did not recognize how big their job would be or know how to cope when problems developed in the opening minutes of an April 15 Football Association Cup semifinal. After the report's release, <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>'s top police officer, <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> Chief Constable <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, submitted his resignation, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckenfield </PERSON>, who was in charge of police at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION>, was suspended pending further review. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he accepted `` full responsibility for police action'' which had `` unraveled like a hand-knitted rug, with terrible consequences to the families who lost loved ones.'' The report said drinking by `` an unruly minority'' of fans and `` confused and inadequate'' signs and tickets issued by the clubs aggravated the problem. But it primarily blamed senior police officials. `` Neither their handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership expected of their rank,'' it said. `` The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control.'' The crush occurred when fans in a standing-room section near the field were crushed against a steel fence by hundreds of people who surged into the stadium behind them. The report recommended a 15 percent reduction in standing-room sections at British soccer stadiums and better safety procedures near the steel fences designed to keep rowdy fans off the field. The report was sent for review to the Home Office, where Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said officials had failed to learn from past problems, including the Heysel riots in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> city fire that killed more than 50 people in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` The tragedy would not have occurred if lessons learned in the past had been properly applied,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rogan </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he was pleased with the report but that it did not eliminate the possibility of future stadium tragedies. `` When 50,000 people gather together, there's a risk of something like this happening,'' he said. `` I think his report is trying to reduce that risk.'' A lack of advance work and inadequate communication led to a buildup of fans outside the <LOCATION> Leppings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> entrance to the stadium, where <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> was playing <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, the report said. Once police ordered a large gate be opened to let fans in, just before kickoff, there was inadequate effort to direct them away from an already packed standing-room section. A surge of hundreds of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> fans into the area, known as <ORGANIZATION> Pen </ORGANIZATION> 3, pushed those already there forward, crushing victims against metal fences or concrete floors and walls, it said. `` Failure to cut off access to the central pens'' was the main cause of the tragedy, Justice <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who headed the inquiry, said in the report. `` They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities had been laid down. ... When the influx entered Pen 3 the layout of the barriers afforded less protection than it should and a barrier collapsed. Again the lack of vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish reaction. `` The club and police should have realized that the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers demanded of it unless they -LRB- fans -RRB- arrived steadily over a lengthy period.'' Officials said the report's recommendations should be implemented to insure safety during the new English soccer season starting Aug. 19.

<HEAD>Violinist Entered Drug Clinic, Ex-Wife Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A concert violinist once billed as the `` <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> of classical music'' has reportedly entered a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> drug clinic after being arrested on drug charges last week in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the ex-wife of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> entered the clinic Tuesday, but she did not identify it. An official with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the state has at least 10 private substance abuse treatment programs. Of the program officials reached by telephone Thursday and today, none offered any information about <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> being in treatment. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, a 39-year-old <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> native and winner of the 1974 <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was arrested July 27 on charges including possession of heroin and cocaine. He was released from the <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, jail Monday on his own recognizance. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> also was charged with breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony after allegedly entering an unoccupied room at a <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard hotel. Police said they seized 20 grams of heroin, some cocaine and a dagger from the violinist. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> called her before entering the 12-step drug rehabilitation and counseling program. `` He wants to do it,'' she said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> in 1978 and divorced him in 1985, said she could not explain how he apparently became dependent on narcotics. `` I think everyone is confused,'' she said. However, `` if your identity is tied up in what you do, and things are not going the way you think they should, you're totally frustrated and very vulnerable and emotional.'' After great initial promise, including an <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> contract, <ORGANIZATION> Fodor </ORGANIZATION>'s international career failed to take off and was in relative decline recently, though he had concert bookings. `` Early in his career, before his feet ever touched this country from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he was billed as the <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> of classical music and a playboy. He came back to this whirlwind and had 90 engagements in his first year,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 About 1,000 Chinese swamped government offices for a third day in a row Friday, apparently prompted by rumors it was easy to gain asylum in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, officials said. `` We do n't know who started the rumors, but there is not a grain of truth to it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Raskin </PERSON>. Almost all of the Chinese have been coming from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, he said. Others have driven in from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Most work illegally in restaurants or the garment industry in those countries and have no official documents, he said. Since Wednesday, they have lined the street leading to the main refugee center in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. They have not been deterred by official leaflets explaining the difficulties of gaining refugee status. <PERSON> Raskin </PERSON> said all requests that have been investigated during the recent surge have been turned down. Instead, the applicants have received orders to leave <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. `` Police have increased controls along the border,'' he said. Newspapers reported the confusion may have arisen after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said that following the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, Chinese already living in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> could ask for an extension of their residency permits. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> approved legislation last year to limit foreign refugees, arguing it wanted to stop those people who falsely claim to be political refugees but only come to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> to find work.

<HEAD>Sandinistas, Opposition Agree Contras Should Be Disbanded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said today the Sandinista government and opposition groups have agreed that the U.S.-supported Contra rebels should be disbanded. The government also said it would suspend the military draft for five months, starting in September, to ease tensions with the opposition and to help keep the war from flaring up. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who will attend a two-day Central American summit this weekend, said he will insist at the summit that camps housing 12,000 Contras and thousands of their dependents in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> be disbanded. Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> has also been saying for some time that his country finds the Contras a burden. The summit, involving the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, is part of a regional peace plan that aims to negotiate an end to the Contra conflict and to the leftist guerrilla war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. It is being held in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> beach resort of <PERSON> Tela </PERSON>. The talks Saturday and Sunday will concentrate mostly on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Contra leaders are resisting the move to disband the Contras and want to postpone such a move until after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government holds free and fair elections Feb. 25, as promised. The agreement to back disbandment was reached after 22 hours of talks between Sandinistas and leaders of 20 opposition parties. The talks recessed Thursday night. Sandinista leaders also said they planned to suspend the military draft from September until after the February elections in an effort to ease tensions with the opposition and de-escalate the war. The talks were called by the Sandinistas to reform <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s election laws to accomodate opposition objections that their candidates were not allowed to campaign freely in past elections Past constraints on the opposition included news censorship. The agreement on disbanding the Contras `` calls on the presidents of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to push forward the plan to demobilize and repatriate voluntarily'' the rebels. It also called on `` the region's governments to abstain from carrying out undercover activities during <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s electoral process.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also pledged to grant unconditional amnesty to all people arrested for inciting political disorder. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, visited <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and other Central American nations this week to urge against disbanding the Contras until after elections. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a member of the rebel political directorate, said he was `` elated that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has come out unequivocally in favor of having the resistance remain as a viable force.'' The process of democratization in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, promised by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government, remains to be seen, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` You do not take down the scaffold before the building is finished,'' he said. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washsington </LOCATION>, briefing reporters on the <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> trip, cited complaints that the Sandinista government is mounting raids against suspected Contra sympathizers in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and has failed to create fair conditions for political opponents. All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras was cut off a year ago and the rebels now receive a trickle of non-lethal assistance, such as food and boots.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest automobile manufacturer said Friday it will stop using chlorofluorocarbons, which are blamed for hurting the Earth's protective ozone layer. By 1995, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will discontinue use of the gas, which it uses for cleaning, cooling and foaming during manufacturing, said spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> used 2,800 tons of CFCs during 1988, he said. The Toyota group, which includes affiliated parts suppliers, used 9,500 tons in that year, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s action follows a move by <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second - and third-largest automakers, to cease using the gas by the mid-1990s The auto industry consumes 14 percent of all CFCs used in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, makers say. In 1987, 38 countries agreed in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to reduce production and use of the gases. Under the Montreal Protocol, participating countries must have frozen their consumption of CFCs at the 1986 level by July 1, 1898, and reduce consumption to 5 percent of the 1986 level by the end of 1999.

 Hurricane Dean turned away from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and moved slowly northward to the open <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> today, apparently rendering its 85 mph winds harmless. All hurricane and flood warnings and watches have been lifted throughout the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> said today. `` The main thing is that it did what we wanted it do in that it missed the islands down there,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> of the hurricane center. `` It appears now that it's going to be a marine problem for the next couple of days.'' The waters north of the islands are heavily traveled by local craft and cruise ships, but Case said the vessels will be able to steer around <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` Looking at the satellite, it looks like it's going to drift northward,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. Dean wo n't threaten any land for days `` unless something really strange happens,'' he added. At noon EDT, the storm's center was located 210 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, near latitude 21.2 north and longitude 63.9 west. It was drifting slowly northward, and was expected to pick up speed later today. A weakening of upper atmosphere winds that steer the storm kept <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> away from the islands on Thursday. The Puerto Rican <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> canceled plans to evacuate 2,000 people from flood-prone areas. Earlier, repeated warnings on television and radio that <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was headed for the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> caused a shopping rush as people stocked up on food, drinking water and buckets, batteries, candles and tape. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was not expected to gain much strength today. `` It may pulsate a little bit in strength,'' forecaster <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> said. `` Normally when hurricanes slow down they strengthen. In this particular case I think that's being offset by deleterious winds at the upper level.'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, the second hurricane of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season, became a tropical storm Monday night and on Tuesday passed the hurricane threshold of 74 mph winds.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he would explore `` to the fullest'' an offer by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new leader to help end the hostage crisis in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, saying it sounded encouraging but emphasizing that `` I do n't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment.'' `` This is a brutal process,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the hostages' plight. One day after terrorists suspended a threatened death sentence against hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters, `` I was certainly pleased that the brutal murder that had been threatened was set aside. `` I do n't know the total role of any individual country in that area in all of this but when you see a statement that offers hope for the return of our hostages, I want to explore it to the fullest,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> answered several questions from reporters after posing for pictures in the Oval Office with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators sponsoring legislation to authorize a presidential line-item veto. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said during a weekly prayer sermon today at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, `` These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems. Come let us approach the problem reasonably. We too will help solve the problems there, so the people of the region can live in peace and harmony.'' `` I tell the White House, the problem of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has solutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is thought to have strong influence over Shiite Moslem militants holding Americans captive. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s statement encouraging, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We're always skeptical of what we hear'' from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to confirm numerous reports that he had been prepared to order retaliatory military action if <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> had been killed. `` If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the last place I'd be talking about it,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, talking with reporters later, said emphatically that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not made a final decision on military action. `` I talked to the president about this very question before he came out, I know what he intended to say, I know what he said and I know what the truth is and I know he did not -LRB- make a final decision -RRB-,'' the spokesman said. Moreover, with hostages still in captivity, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` it is not helpful to be flexing our muscles in public.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had been engaged in `` an extroardinarily broad exercise of diplomacy'' over the last several days on behalf of the hostages. White House officials said he called upwards of a dozen world leaders to seek their help. As for the offer from <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I am pleased about that. I do n't know what it means fully, but I think the world is familiar with our policy _ that there will be nothing done ever that will create a new incentive for taking somebody else hostage. `` I feel the burden of going to every end possible to try to find ... the return of these Americans to their loved ones and to find out the truth about Col. -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>,'' a hostage reported hanged in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Monday by kidnappers. Asked if recent developments suggest a break in the hostage crisis, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm encouraged but I do n't want to get the hopes of the hostages' loved ones up once again to have those hopes dashed. `` This is a brutal process where you see people paraded before cameras and the families get their hopes up. My heart is still with Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.'' Noting that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not absolutely sure that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is dead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We ca n't tell her with any definition what _ of her husband's fate.'' The president added, `` I do n't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment but there's reason to be somewhat encouraged.'' Asked what prompted the freeze on <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s death sentence, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I like to think a broad-spread appeal to nations in every corner of the globe had something to do with it. I do n't know for sure. The response I have had on my personal calls and that the secretary had on his has been heart warming. And it's come from all sectors and I have been very, very encouraged by that, and where we go from here, we'll just keep on trying.'' Asked if <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> deserved the full backing of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in view of the fact that he ignored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warnings to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged that, indeed, Americans had been urged not to stay in that strife-torn country. Even so, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` he's an American. He's entitled to the concern of the president, of these senators, of everybody in our administration.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> units remained in readiness today as reports circulated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was prepared to use carrier-based aircraft from the 6th Fleet in a strike against Lebanese terrorists if any American hostages were harmed. Television evangelist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON>, who prayed Thursday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the Oval Office for hostages, said the president had `` made it clear he would take appropriate action'' if another hostage was killed. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` all but decided'' to attack terrorist strongholds in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> base of 2,000 Iranian revolutionary guards, if a hostage had been killed. A White House spokesman reached at home Thursday night, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said, `` To my knowledge that is not true,' but added, `` We just do n't discuss those sorts of things.'' <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s captors indicated he still could be killed `` within days'' unless <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> releases unspecified Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas as well as the Moslem cleric kidnapped by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. Asked Thursday if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would recall any ships, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` I urge everyone to keep in mind, especially in regard to the ships, that we still have a serious problem in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' Asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was considering asking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to extradite <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> for possible involvement in the kidnapping of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said only that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` is looking into the case.'' A law enforcement source said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing laws that allow the arrest and prosecution of terrorists for the kidnapping and murder of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens overseas. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president called at least a dozen leaders in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and elsewhere over the past two days.

 A fire in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> has closed an observatory housing the nation's largest optical telescope until further notice, although the blaze has shifted away from the historic facility, officials said today. Major fires also burned in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The western blazes have blackened nearly 225,000 acres, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reported today. It said more than 21,000 people were fighting the fires. About 500 firefighters were brought in to protect equipment and structures after the 10,780-acre wildfire came within three miles of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>. But she said winds shifted early this morning, pushing the walls of flame westward, away from the hilltop facility, which also has a museum and gallery. Scientists were forced to cease their work and close the telescope Thursday to prevent ash from damaging the telescope's $ 20 million mirror. Observatory officials said today the grounds were closed to visitors until further notice as a precautionary measure. `` We have a lot of unhappy astronomers around here,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thickston </PERSON>, superintendant of the observatory, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. The week-old blaze, in forest that straddles <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> counties 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was less than 60 percent contained, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosalinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON>. Elsewhere in the state, a three-day old fire that has burned 600 acres in the <ORGANIZATION> Mendocino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was declared 75 percent contained. The blaze, in steep, remote terrain, was apparently started by two lost men seeking rescue, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> LaVon </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, cooler weather allowed more than 9,000 firefighters to get the upper hand on a few of the 38 major fires eating up state forests today, but fire bosses braced for predicted higher weekend temperatures. `` We're in an increasing warming and drying trend,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Persing </PERSON>. `` If we reach the weather we had several days ago, things could really start popping.'' Still, headway was made on one of the most critical fires, the 6,200-acre <LOCATION> Fleming </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze near Banks in west-central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. It was contained late Thursday and could be controlled this weekend. The cooler temperatures and higher humidity also allowed final control on the 4,800-acre King Gulch Fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, which at one time threatened <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a major fire was contained and crews welcomed <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> assistance in digging trails around smaller blazes that have burned 93,500 acres in the eastern part of the state. The Dooley Mountain fire burned across nearly 20,000 acres of timber and grazing land, killing 26 cattle and forcing the evacuation of homes and ranches before it was contained Thursday, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Aschenbrenner </PERSON>. Elsewhere, about 650 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, set up camp Thursday outside Unity, about 70 miles southwest of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and three miles from a 13,300-acre fire in the Monument Rock Wilderness. A 23,300-acre fire on the boundary of the Eagle Cap Wildneress area northeast of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> destroyed a small snowmobile hut, but spared the <ORGANIZATION> Lick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wallowa-Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, fire engines stood by to protect two mountain cabins as a lightning-sparked fire in dead timber grew quickly to 600 acres on the Crow Indian Reservation southeast of Billings. An 800-acre grass and timber fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Custer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in the state's southeastern corner was contained. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s northwest corner, a timber fire swept through canyon country 12 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> this morning, burning at least 3,000 acres. Authorities said the fire, which broke out Thursday, could be contained later today, but said winds forecast at 10 to 20 mph could hamper efforts. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s firefighters were sent to other states after its fires were declared out. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> deputy chief, said at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, news conference that fire conditions are extreme to severe in 14 states. `` Long-range weather forecasts indicate continuing severe fire conditions, leaving this fire season with the potential to be as severe as last year's,'' he said. `` We see no relief through the month of October in precipitation and temperature.'' So far this year, more than 39,400 fires have been reported burning 1.38 million acres. That compares with almost 61,200 fires covering 2.37 million acres through the same time period last year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee has voted to investigate three lawmakers accused in complaints of sexual improprieties, two of the members and congressional sources said today. The committee voted in secret session Thursday to conduct preliminary inquiries into the conduct of Reps. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, press spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, said the congressman confirmed to him that he has been formally notified by the ethics panel of the <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said he was also was formally notified of the committee action. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s office had no immediate comment. But <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking only on condition they not be named, confirmed that he also would be investigated. Three House Democrats filed a complaint against <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> this month, after news accounts said a Peace Corps volunteer complained the lawmaker fondled her while he was traveling in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Since the incident, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspector general has sent investigators to collect information on <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s actions during official foreign travels, according to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member who would speak only as an unnamed source. News accounts this week said that when <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as part of a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he revised his schedule and went to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for shopping and sightseeing. Before he moved to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> locked himself in a hotel room to protest the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy's failure to immediately get him on a flight, the accounts said. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> told reporters two weeks ago, `` I did nothing, that's what I did This lie was leaked by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for political reasons.'' `` They tried to destroy Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> with a lie. ... I'm in good company,'' he said at the time. The House Republican caucus, composed of all Republicans, asked the ethics panel to investigate <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who was convicted in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a child. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was sentenced June 30 to 180 days in jail and fined $ 1,000 for having sex with a teen-age girl. He is appealing. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> has said his conviction is no worse than drunk driving or shoplifting. He has criticized <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders for seeking the ethics investigation. <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> aide, said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Republican `` has already said he welcomes a full and open investigation where his accusers' motives and the full record can be brought forth. He added that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> would be able to bring the committee information about the credibility of the teen-age girl and her mother, which was inadmissible in the courtroom. `` That's a positive for <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The complaint against <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> was filed last year by two former aides, who alleged he sexually harassed female members of his staff, and pressured congressional employees into doing campaign work. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said the committee told him there were `` sworn complaints from two individuals saying they were sexually harassed and that congressional resources were used to perform political activity. I would deny they were sexually harassed and that the staff and resources were used to perform campaign-related activities _ at least under my direction.'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> added, `` I look forward to having the matter resolved. It has gone on for a year without any action. I would like it resolved. I do n't think it warrants a preliminary inquiry, but if the committee does, we'll cooperate in any way we can.''

<HEAD>Romanian Diplomat Reportedly on Trial for Spying in Bucharest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior Romanian diplomat charged with passing secrets to a `` foreign power'' has gone on trial in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and faces the death penalty if convicted, an emigre source said Friday. The trial for <PERSON> Mircea </PERSON> <PERSON> Raceanu </PERSON> is taking place behind closed doors, said the source, a spokesman for the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Raceanu </PERSON> served for several years in the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the 1970s. The trial was not reported by <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s state-controlled media, and a League spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> it was not known when it would end. A brief announcement from the General Prosecutor's office carried by Romanian dailies in March said state security bodies had `` uncovered a grave action of betrayal of the interests of the Romanian people and state'' by <PERSON> Raceanu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Raceanu </PERSON> last held the post of deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> desk in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. He was said by emigre sources to have been detained Jan. 31 as he went with his wife to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence to see a movie. `` Being caught in the act, and following the investigations, it has been found that since 1974, when -LRB- <PERSON> Mircea </PERSON> <PERSON> Raceanu </PERSON> -RRB- was recruited by a foreign spying service and became its agent, he has been engaged in steady treasonable action,'' the official Agerpres news agency said last spring, quoting the general prosecutor's statement. It said he managed to supply unspecified `` secret data and intelligence'' to the unidentified power for which he allegedly worked. The maximum penalty for treason is death, if the alleged espionage is deemed to have caused grave damage to state security. The next most severe penalty is 20 years in jail. The prominent media attention given to the arrest indicated authorities wanted to make an example of him following signs of domestic resistance to the tough policies of President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. Emigre sources and Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> linked <PERSON> Raceanu </PERSON>'s arrest to a protest letter to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> signed by six <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> figures, including <PERSON> Raceanu </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON>.

<HEAD>NOW Using Personal Checks to Send Message on Abortion Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The National Organization for Women is using personal checks to lobby against the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision giving states greater leeway to regulate abortion. People who advocate the right to choose can purchase bright yellow checks that say `` Pro Choice _ Protect Our Right to Choose'' and send a political message each time they use their checkbooks, NOW spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> said Thursday. The average person writes 300 checks a year and the recipients are `` a captive audience,'' said <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON>, founder of the Seattle-based Messsage! <ORGANIZATION> Check </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` About six to 10 people see each check as it goes through the banking system _ from the people you write the check to all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>,'' said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON>. Asked what sparked the idea pro-choice checks, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> replied: `` Money.'' `` Everybody has to spend it and this is a way that sends a message with the money,'' she said. `` It's much more of a consciousness-raiser than a fund-raiser. And it demonstrates the economic clout of pro-choice supporters. `` A lot of people have been supporters but not activists since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision went down,'' said <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, adding that the checks, which have been available about three months, give them a chance in everyday life to show their support for the pro-choice cause. `` If I'm standing in a supermarket line and I write my check to the cashier _ in some way it gives you the opportunity to talk to people about the issue,'' she said. NOW has been distributing checks that say `` Equality for Women'' through Message!

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said Friday it would not crack down on intellectuals even though some participated in recent pro-democracy protests, but it also stripped leading dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> of his post on an academic board. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, refused immediate comment on reports by a Japanese news agency that senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is gravely ill with prostate cancer. An unsigned commentary in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> appeared aimed at reassuring <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s educated elite, some of whom have come under sharp attack for supporting what the party calls `` bourgeois liberalism'' _ Western liberal ideas _ and the student-led pro-democracy movement `` There has been some concern as to whether the party's policy toward intellectuals would change. It is necessary to reaffirm that -LRB- it -RRB- has not changed and will not change,'' the commentary said. It called the intellectuals who took part in the student movement `` scum of the intellectuals -LRB- who -RRB- do not represent the intellectuals'' and `` enemies of the party and of the people.'' `` It is in the interest of the workers, peasants and intellectuals to punish them, and the party will protect that interest,'' it said. `` Those who were under the influence of the wave of bourgeois liberalism ... will elevate their understanding and continue to make contributions'' to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modernization program, it said. The army's violent crackdown on mass demonstrations in early June has ushered in a new era of repression. Chinese are urged to turn in friends and family members who participated in the protests, and many must attend weekly political study sessions reminiscent of the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. The crackdown has brought an end to a period of relatively free political debate. Newspapers once more are under strict party control, and the works of 10 writers, including <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, have been banned. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, an astrophysicist, was relieved of his position on the <ORGANIZATION> Academic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Degrees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> under the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cabinet, and of his qualification to tutor doctoral students. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who took refuge inside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with his wife shortly after the crackdown, already had lost another minor post but apparently still retains his main job at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Observatory </LOCATION>. The government has issued arrest warrants for <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife, physics professor <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, for allegedly inciting pro-democracy protests and has demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> turn them over to Chinese authorities. Thousands of students, intellectuals and others are believed to have been arrested for participating in the seven-week movement. During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, intellectuals were severely persecuted as `` class enemies.'' Since then, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> hasd emphasized the need for skilled and talented intellectuals to help <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> modernize. The educated elite, however, remains among the lowest paid and most politically vulnerable of all Chinese. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Jiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified Chinese sources as saying the health of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, had deteriorated seriously a few days ago, and that emergency medical personnel were sent to care for him at a coastal resort east of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It quoted doctors as saying they were discussing whether <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was too ill to be moved to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where better facilities were available. An employee in the information department of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said he had received many queries about <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s health but could issue no immediate response. There was no answer Friday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s news office. In another development, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Home Ofice said it has granted political asylum to three Chinese diplomats and is considering an application from a fourth. A Home Office spokesman identified one of the diplomats given asylum <LOCATION> Nin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hongshan </LOCATION>, a second secretary in the embassy's educational section He said the others were all middle-ranking diplomats but would not identify them. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, two Chinese exiles said a group that aims to provide a democratic alternative to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will hold its inaugural congress of 120 delegates from around the world next month. The congress will be held secretly in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and will involve exiled student leaders and intellectuals as well as individuals traveling surreptitiously from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said the exiles, <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> is former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a large computer company that is one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most successful private enterprises. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> is a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and a former close adviser to deposed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>.

 Thousands of devoted admirers of Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> vied to show their devotion to the former monarch on her 89th birthday Friday with flowers, cakes and poetry at her residence, <ORGANIZATION> Clarence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Millard </PERSON>, 7, wearing an Irish Guard uniform, gave the Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> flowers encased in glass, saluted and executed a crisp about-face before the grown-up Irish Guards made their annual march past the residence. The Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>, widow of King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> and one of the most popular royals, looked cool in a blue, lilac and yellow floral print dress and a lilac hat. The Irish Guards played several refrains of `` Happy Birthday'' and the crowd, estimated at 3,000, joined in. She spent about 25 minutes accepting flowers from children and appeared to have a smile and a word for each one. Servants circulated afterward to collects armloads of bouquets. The party inside the residence was joined by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s two children, <PERSON> Viscount </PERSON> <PERSON> Linley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong-Jones </PERSON>. Many in the crowd outside were veteran well-wishers and staked out places early. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 24, from <ORGANIZATION> Horsham </ORGANIZATION>, was the first on the scene, at 4 a.m. `` I've been coming here for six or seven years now. I just enjoy it because it is a chance to see the Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> with other members of the family,'' she said. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlan </PERSON>, 64, from <LOCATION> Wakefield </LOCATION>, said she had been coming every year for about 15 years. She brought a basket of flowers including, she said, heather from <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION>, the royal estate in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. She also had a big yellow sign saying `` Happy Birthday, Ma'am.'' <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a local government officer from <ORGANIZATION> Macclesfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION>, brought a basket of fruit, three photographs he had taken of the Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> and a poem. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brereton </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> with a home-baked version of the Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>'s favorite cake recipe. The Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Friday for the royal family's annual holiday. On Thursday, the National Gallery unveiled an unconventional portrait of her without her customary hat, wearing a simple dress and staring almost grimly out of the canvas. <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, the 23-year-old <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> artist who painted it, says she did n't want the portrait to look particularly royal. `` She always appears fluffy, light, wearing flowing clothes and I wanted to make her more solid. She has a lot of character,'' Ms. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I did n't want her to come across as a wee waif.'' The Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> said, was happy with the portrait, but that could not be confirmed. `` I do not know what the Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> thinks of it,'' said a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Clarence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. `` Presumably she has seen it because she sat for it, but we do not issue statements on silly little things like this.''

 The House today passed a $ 286.5 billion defense spending bill and lawmakers struggled to find final agreement on a savings and loan bailout as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rushed toward its summer recess. The military bill, which was approved on a vote of 312-105, eliminates funds for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed Advanced Tactical Fighter and Advanced Cruise Missile but restores money for the F-14D jet that he wants to kill. It also slashes nearly $ 2 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> from the president's request, strictly limits the B-2 stealth bomber program and makes drastic cuts in the MX and <LOCATION> Midgetman </LOCATION> nuclear missiles. The White House budget office said before the vote that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s senior advisers would recommend he veto the measure because it `` would severely compromise the administration's objective of providing adequate defense capabilities within constrained resources. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> urged his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues to support a compromise $ 159 billion savings and loan bailout plan, saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not start its summer recess without acting to stem continuing losses in the industry. `` To delay it or defeat it, that will cost money,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added his endorsement of the compromise plan in a letter to congressional leaders that said: `` This legislation has been developed in a bipartisan process. It is badly needed, and must be enacted without further delay. I ask that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approve this legislation today.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters that many in his party have misgivings about the latest deal negotiated to salvage a rescue plan that has gone through a host of changes in recent weeks. `` I think this bill needs to be passed,'' he said, although the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Democrat said his party had been reluctant to agree to any plan that would put bailout spending off the federal budget _ as the latest compromise proposes. ` This is a compromise that we did n't prefer to make,'' he said. But he said that because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has been adamant about taking it off budget, we had to deal with that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today also passed, on a 99-0 vote, legislation to boost financial liability for oil spills, create a nationwide system to clean them up and establish a $ 1 billion trust fund to help compensate for damages. The bill was prompted by the accident involving the tanker Exxon Valdez this year. And the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a compromise proposal to provide $ 895 million to farmers suffering crop losses this year from drought and other weather-related damage. The measure was passed on unanimous consent, without a recorded vote, and sent back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. During a frenetic day of lawmaking Thursday, there were these other developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved an $ 11.9 billion measure to finance <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operations in the new budget year starting Oct. 1 The measure included language making permanent a ban on smoking on all domestic airline flights of two hours or less. `` This is probably the most popular bill we've passed around here in two years,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., sponsor of both the existing and the new restrictions _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, brushing aside a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto threat, gave final passage to a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> appropriations bill that included a provision easing restrictions on public financing of abortions in the nation's capital _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation that would reduce the amount of money <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to spend next year on mail The nearly $ 2 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill earmarks $ 80 million for lawmakers' postage, compared with $ 124.7 million in the bill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved earlier this week. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation that would give Vietnam-era veterans disability benefits for certain illnesses associated with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of Agent Orange The bill provides payments on an interim basis, through April 15, 1992, while providing for subsequent congressional votes to make the benefits permanent. Benefits would be paid to veterans with <PERSON> non-Hodgkin </PERSON>'s lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma. A broader version is pending in the House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and congressional negotiators, working late into the night Thursday, reached agreement on a plan they said would be acceptable to their colleagues and the White House. A House-Senate split over how to pay for some elements of the relief program had forced new negotiations, raising doubts about whether lawmakers could meet today's target date for starting the annual getaway. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> took part in the talks. `` Obviously we've only had an opportunity to make a quick review, but based on that review ... in the spirit of which the president sent us here, which was one of compromise, we accept,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. The pact set the stage for final action today by both chambers, and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders voiced confidence they could muster sufficient votes to pass the bill and send it to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Reflecting lawmakers' growing restiveness in the wake of a series of long work days, Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, groused at one point during the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L fight that `` 90 percent of the people want to get out of here They have reservations for vacations.'' Aside from the S & amp; L bailout, the only legislation that had to be acted upon before recess was a bill to temporarily extend the government's debt limit by $ 70 billion, to $ 2.87 trillion. That was needed to grant the government authority to borrow enough money to function for the next three months. Lawmakers continued to work on 13 government appropriations bills. But they have until Sept. 30 to get them approved, and thus were under no pressure to finish the measures before heading home. Although much of the argument about financing the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout was framed around the technical question of whether the budget-balancing act could be stretched to accommodate a $ 44 billion chunk of the overall price tag, the tinge of partisanship was unmistakable. Many Democrats were loath to let <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> use off-budget techniques to mask the impact of the new spending on the overall federal budget deficit, which is estimated in the range of $ 148 billion for the current fiscal year. Some Democrats still believe tax increases eventually will be necessary to curb the red-ink problem even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has reiterated his `` no-new-taxes'' pledge of last year's presidential campaign. The compromise reached late Thursday is a hybrid of two conflicting plans to avoid automatic spending cuts under the deficit-reduction law.

 Sailors of the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to visit this <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port were treated like celebrities Friday, posing for snapshots, signing autographs, kissing babies and even dodging coins tossed by admirers. More than 1,000 whistling, waving Soviets climbed on the pier as the Aegis-class cruiser U.S.S. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and frigate U.S.S. <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> pulled into the headquarters of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. The port call mirrored a visit last month by three Soviet ships to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in the first such Soviet-American naval exchange in 14 years. `` That's for ice cream when you come ashore,'' called one woman in the crowd as she lobbed a 20-kopeck coin toward the sailors lined along the ships' decks in their summer whites. `` You have to understand, for Americans to visit us is about the same as if Martians visited you,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer who would not give his name. `` This is great,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> navigator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, dodging a coin. `` I ca n't wait to hit the beach.'' Crewmen were handed babies to kiss, asked to pose for photos and given rubles, souvenirs and food. A brass band played marches and two women in traditional <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> costumes met the ship with bread and salt, traditional symbols of hospitality. `` My whole soul is happy that we finally did this great thing and that we will be friends,'' said <PERSON> Zinaida </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolisinchenko </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>. `` And the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors, they are so attractive.'' The Americans were equally excited. `` It just feels great to be making history,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlatt </PERSON>, medical officer of the cruiser Gates. The city hosted former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> a year ago, but <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> public affairs officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weishautt </PERSON> said this was the first time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships had docked at <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>. The 6th Fleet's flagship, the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belknap </ORGANIZATION>, also was supposed to visit but was diverted to be at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s disposal during the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> hostage crisis. <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> is normally a closed city, even for Soviets. But it opened its gates wide to greet the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors. Throughout the day, crewmen could be see strolling the city's streets, often surrounded by female admirers The carnival atmosphere lasted into Friday evening. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zverev </PERSON>, the military commandant of <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>, looked with amusement at the crowd on the pier. `` We did n't expect so many people,'' he said. `` This is the biggest reception for a ship I have ever seen here.'' But he said the welcome was appropriate `` given the state of our relations today.'' Adm. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khronopulo </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fleet, said Friday he could not have imagined even two years ago he would be receiving senior <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers in such a friendly atmosphere. But now, he said, the idea that Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> captains might share a cup of tea as their ships pass `` is difficult to imagine, but not impossible.'' The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors, too, commented on the strange sensation of suddenly being treated as such good friends. Aviator <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Zentry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> recalled having been trained to recognize Soviet ships from afar. `` And now, here were are right next to them,'' he said. The agenda for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors includes a tour of state farms, a vineyard, an art museum, an aquarium, a war museum and naval installations. They will be entertained at concerts, eat meals aboard Soviet ships and play basketball, soccer and volleyball with their Soviet counterparts. <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>, in its strategic position on the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, has been the target of many invasions since it was founded on a Greek colony in 1422 B.C. A monument stands in the town harbor to <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> ships that were intentionally sunk there to block the way for invaders during the Crimean War in the mid-1850s. Modern-day <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>, despite its many navy installations, conveys an atmosphere of seaside ease, with its classical architecture and many rose bushes.

 A former high-ranking aide to Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has been indicted for perjury in testimony regarding political patronage, officials announced today, less than six weeks before the mayoral primary election. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON>, former special assistant to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, was accused of lying to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Government Integrity on July 13 and 21 last year and in a public hearing of that commission this past Jan. 11. <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON>, 46, told the commission that politically connected job applicants were not given favorable treatment, a position contradicted by other witnesses. <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> appeared in state court today, pleaded innocent and was released on his own recognizance pending an Aug. 11 hearing. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherkasky </PERSON>, who announced today that the 11-count indictment issued up Thursday, noted that patronage is not illegal. Perjury, however, is punishable by a maximum of seven years in prison. <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> was responsible for the city's <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which ostensibly recruited minorities to fill city posts. Critics claim the program actually was a patronage mill, doling out the highest paying jobs to whites. Files relating to the program's operations were destroyed at the beginning of city corruption scandals. <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> and others told the commission that the destruction of those records was routine and not part of a cover-up. The <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which operated out of an office in the basement of City Hall, has become a campaign issue as <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> seeks the Democratic nomination to run for a fourth term in November. District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>, in an telephone interview, defended the timing of the indictment. `` We did consider it,'' <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. `` But we could not be in the role of censor, deciding what the public could and could not hear.'' He said that if possible, the charges would have been filed earlier, but `` we moved as expeditiously as we could.'' The commission was told that some of the files at the <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> were marked with color codes, indicating a party leader or other political sponsor who might have referred an applicant to <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON>. His own assistant, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hein </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> had ordered him in February 1986 to `` cleanse'' the employment computer and paper files of `` any references to political figures.'' In February, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> announced that he had asked for <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON>'s resignation But <PERSON> DeVinenzo </PERSON> had already filed papers to resign, ensuring his pension of $ 52,000 a year.

<HEAD>Defense Minister: MiG-Backed Forces Ready For Viet Pullout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-supported army, now with advanced Soviet MIG-21 jet fighters, is ready to take on guerrillas after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout in September, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> defense minister said. On the diplomatic front, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> fact-finding mission dispatched by an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> prepared to visit <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> next week before touring the embattled Thai-Cambodian border, a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> official said Friday. Defense Minister <PERSON> Tie </PERSON> <PERSON> Banh </PERSON> said new military hardware helped make the military a regular force with infantry, navy and air force components, according to a report by the official <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> news agency that was seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Friday. `` Besides the unit of MIG-21, forces of armored cars, tanks and artillery have also shaped and become ever more effective in fighting,'' <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying, without giving any numbers. Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government after invading <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ousting the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rulers. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, with up to 40,000 fighters the largest of the three guerrilla forces, poses the greatest threat to the government. The first squadron of MIG-21s piloted by Cambodians landed in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> in June, <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> earlier reported. On July 27, <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Naruedol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejpradiyuth </PERSON> quoted a report that the jets were dispatched from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bien </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoa </PERSON> airbase to boost the Cambodian army in anticipation of the pullout. Before the jets arrived, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent tanks, artillery guns, and `` a vast amount of war materiel'' to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Kompong Som port on June 12, according to the army radio of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Western analysts have judged the Cambodian army unimpressive on the battlefield.

 Israeli analysts said Friday the apparent willingness of pro-Iranian kidnappers to suspend threats and start talking has vindicated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision to abduct a Shiite Moslem cleric. They say creating movement on the hostage issue is an achievement, even though there is no guarantee negotiations will start in earnest or result in freeing either <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or Western hostages. The Israelis have offered to trade Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> for three of their soldiers held prisoner in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the 16 Western hostages, who include eight Americans. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is a spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group believed responsible for kidnappings of foreigners. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> put the issue of hostages back on the international agenda,'' said <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Avineri </PERSON>, a former director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Until the current crisis, `` the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> accepted people being captured by bandits and had come to believe nothing could be done about it,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazit </PERSON>, a former chief of military intelligence, said the abduction was a catalyst for a new willingness by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to trade hostages. Without it, `` nothing would have happened and all the existing hostages would be in the same hopeless situation as before,'' he said. <PERSON> Gazit </PERSON> said it also `` put the Israeli hostages on the agenda, and that was the exact purpose.'' <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, a leading military commentator, was among the few public critics. Writing in the liberal daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, he called the abduction a policy of `` restrained lunacy,'' but added that it might help deter future acts of terror. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> authorized the July 28 abduction by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos after coming under intense pressure to get the Israeli soldiers home. <ORGANIZATION> Dore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said there was a special sensitivity in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about not abandoning soldiers in the field. Failure to act, he said, `` would have a very deleterious effect on the morale of the army when it goes into battle. So that leaves an activist policy as the only choice after efforts to arrange negotiations failed.'' `` Sometimes there is a misunderstanding why <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is not more aggressive in offering peace,'' he said, adding that the week's events `` show that the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is a violent region ... and you have to understand <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s caution. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction brought criticism from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, especially after the captors of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> kidnapped while on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty, said Monday they had hanged him in retaliation. They released a videotape of a man who appeared to be <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on a gallows. Some critics said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had failed to consider the effect of its actions on American hostages, even though <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and some other reports say <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was killed several months ago. Such attacks caused concern in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which depends on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for $ 3 billion a year in economic and military aid, but <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, chief spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said there was no lasting damage. `` The attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to drive a wedge between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> failed,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. `` All and all, we are pleased to see our standing in public opinion is very high on this issue. This is very gratifying.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may not be out of the woods, however. Some analysts believe the final evaluation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s actions will depend on the results of negotiations. <PERSON> Avineri </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the action `` will be judged by its outcome. If the outcome is horrible and hostages are killed, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will be condemned. If some or all the hostages are freed, no one will split hairs about marginal mistakes.'' How far <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will go in meeting Shiite demands for release of an unspecified number of Palestinians remains a question. About 8,000 Palestinians have been jailed since an uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began 20 months ago in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Officials are likely to oppose allowing hard-core activists and convicted killers to return to the occupied lands, which happened after 1,050 Arabs were traded in May 1985 for three soldiers held by a radical Palestinian group led by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nativ </PERSON>, a retired general who helped negotiate that exchange, said on army radio <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was the strongest card for getting hostages out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In 1985, he noted, there was no movement in negotiations `` until we kidnapped -LRB- <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s -RRB- nephew.''

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm has thrown down the gauntlet. Atop last week's milk carton, the call of the roll from the 1964 Republican National Convention and a copy of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Star, which folded Aug. 7, 1981, turns up an announcement looking for the messiest desk in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The prize, worth $ 415, is free tuition in the firm's training course in time management. That is, how to have a tidy desk and, presumably, tidy habits. The offer comes from Priority Management, which trains people in how to arrange their day, manage their time, keep their files and, above all else, prioritize. Priority Management has no intention of inspecting the nominated desks to separate the truly disgusting from the merely slovenly. It will settle for photographic evidence, says <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozzo </PERSON>, director of marketing and the brains behind the contest. True to form, this is what she has to say, unprompted: `` A cluttered desk is a cluttered mind.'' The contest entries, says Ms. <PERSON> Rozzo </PERSON>, on whose desk there is a place for everything and everything is in its place, will be scrutinized for these symptoms: _ Multiple calendars -LRB- They lead to overbooking, says Ms. <PERSON> Rozzo </PERSON>. -RRB- _ Those little pink phone messages, scattered around -LRB- One may return yesterday's call more than once. -RRB- _ Reminders on scraps of paper, strewn about -LRB- Tch, tch. -RRB- _ Someday files -LRB- as in `` someday I'll get around to it'' -RRB- _ Leaning towers in the `` in'' box _ Open files atop the desk `` Open files distract from the task at hand,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rozzo </PERSON> said, yielding to an impulse to instruct. `` Let's say you have four projects going on at the same time. People usually have files from all four on their desks. We show people they should n't do that. We say put three of the files on some other piece of office furniture. We love credenzas. People who make credenzas love us.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rozzo </PERSON> said her firm teaches people how to organize their day, how to say `` No, I ca n't talk to you,'' how to delegate and how to keep a boss or colleague from laying on an unscheduled chore by asking, `` Is it urgent and important? Can it wait?'' Instead of saying, `` I'll get back to you,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Rozzo </PERSON>, `` you should say, ` I will call you on Aug. 9.''' One should not say, `` I will call you on Aug. 9 if I can find my telephone under this pile of stuff.'' That is very untidy. It will not do.

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Warns Against Infighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The underground leadership of the Palestinian uprising Friday denounced groups that have threatened Arab nationalists, claiming the infighting is inspired by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Nationalists have been accused of collaboration and their cars have been burned in the name of the uprising,'' said a leaflet signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and circulated in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. It urged <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to `` declare war'' on those issuing false leaflets, which it said were `` inspired by suspicious elements working in the enemy's -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s -RRB- intelligence.'' The statement comes amid a growing trend of violence, threats and factional rivalry within the Arab community in the 20-month-old uprising. At least 87 Palestinian deaths have been blamed on other Arabs since the revolt against Israeli rule began in December 1987. Army gunfire and Israeli settlers have killed 527 Palestinians. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died. The army said Friday it is investigating the stabbing death of an Arab man whose body was found near <LOCATION> Kufr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zibad </LOCATION> village, 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted residents as saying the man was suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and had been interrogated by uprising leaders before he was slain. The underground leadership's leaflet condemned statements issued by 10 largely obscure groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. A statement issued in the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on July 16 threatened <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> for allegedly misusing uprising funds and cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Prosecution papers filed in an Israeli case against several uprising leaders alleged <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> was paymaster of the uprising. But the professor, a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> supporter, never was charged. <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarifi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> lawyer, was threatened by wall slogans signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The leaflet did not refer to that group, which participates in the unified leadership. <PERSON> Tarifi </PERSON> recently announced that he took part in talks with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Several Arabs have met with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to discuss his peace initiative, but <PERSON> Tarifi </PERSON> is the only one to publicly admit it. The initiative calls for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to select Palestinians to open talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited autonomy. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Friday again ruled out any dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> brands a terrorist organization but many Palestinians consider their sole legitimate representative. `` We will not meet and talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are not partners to peace. They are the very opposite of peace. Their objective is to eliminate the Jewish state and replace it with another Arab state.'' His comments coincided with the general congress of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is seeking support for his recent moderate stance and calls for peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shells crashed into residential areas of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday during a five-hour battle that sent civilians rushing to bomb shelters. Police said two people died and seven were wounded. The clash started as an exchange of sniper fire between the Christian district of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Rummaneh </PERSON> and the adjacent Shiite Moslem slum of <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>. It developed into a duel with howitzers, mortars and cannons that lasted until midday. Each side accused the other of starting the clash. Explosions echoed through the narrow alleys of <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>, and people ran for cover as the call to Friday prayers blared from mosque minarets. Businesses that opened in nearby districts closed. `` Now they're shelling <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>. It might develop and reach us,'' said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON>, a grocer in the <LOCATION> Zarif </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` What a life. We are living under the ground like the dead. We might as well die,'' he murmured as he lowered his shop's shutter and headed off for a shelter with a bag of canned food and some bottled water. By police count, the 20-week-old confrontation between the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> troops of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Syrian troops has killed 516 people and wounded 2,183. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Syrian snipers in <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> targeted his soldiers' positions in <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Rummaneh </PERSON> `` Our sharpshooters responded to the fire. They -LRB- Syrians -RRB- upgraded their fire power and we responded in kind,'' the spokesman said. A spokesman for the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s closest ally and dominant in <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldiers `` had to open fire at <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army to protect <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>'s citizens.'' `` <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s soldiers were shooting at everything that moved in <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> early in the morning. The Syrians fired back to silence the sources of fire,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who identified himself only by the code name <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>. He said Amal fighters did not take part in the confrontation. A police spokesman, who can not be named in line with regulations, said the two fatalities occurred in <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>. Syrian gunners <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> opened up with 130mm Soviet-designed howitzers at the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Kfarshima </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the police spokesman said. He said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners responded with 155mm U.S.-made howitzers, shelling <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> and the Druse suburb of <LOCATION> Choueifat </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s tanks deployed in the suburb of <LOCATION> Haszmiyeh </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, also shelled the Shiite slums of <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moallem </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION>'s southern edge, he added. Only 200,000 people of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s original 1.5 million population remain in the city, the main arena for ferocious shelling duels since the Christian-Syrian confrontation broke out March 8. Most refugees have settled in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION> and the Christian-controlled mountain resorts northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The confrontation broke out after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias to recover lost customs dues. The Syrians and allied Moslem and leftist forces retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the capital. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, escalated the confrontation by declaring a `` war of liberation'' against the 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in predominantly Moslem sections of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration expressed optimism Friday over signs that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is pursuing a more moderate course under its new president but said relations can not improve unless <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> helps secure the release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The reactions came after the Iranian president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said there are `` reasonable, prudent solutions'' to the hostage problem. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s comments appeared to be the most hopeful indication of a possible accommodation between the two countries since Islamic fundamentalists ousted the pro-American monarchy in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> 10 -LCB- years ago. The loss of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into the anti-American camp was considered one of the worst strategic setbacks for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since World War II, given <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s location and abundant oil reserves. For the third day in a row, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday issued a cautious but upbeat statement citing evidence that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was moving away from its policy of unswerving hostility toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We do not have a full text of President <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s remarks and we are reacting cautiously to the reported excerpts,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. `` However, based on the excerpts we have seen, President <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s remarks appear to be moderate and are therefore encouraging. `` We have reason to believe that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is genuinely engaged and no reason to believe that its engagement is not focussed in a positive direction,'' she said. But she added that any improvement in relations will be contingent on Iranian willingness to act `` responsibly in the world arena to include an effort to resolve the hostage issue once and for all by producing release of all our hostages and by making it clear that they have turned away from support of terrorism.'' For his part, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would explore `` to the fullest'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s offer of cooperation. But he added, `` I do n't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment.'' Hours earlier, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> had said in his weekly prayer sermon at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will `` help solve the problems'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I tell the White House, the problem of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has solutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. But, like the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> attached conditions to his offer of cooperation. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must take the initiative by pressuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem cleric it kidnapped from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> a week ago. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responds by saying it can not do so, `` this is n't acceptable to us,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. Still, Iranian behavior for much of the hostage crisis this week has been in marked contrast to what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was accustomed to under the rule of the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who died in June. The first hint of a new Iranian approach occurred Tuesday, when <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> expressing regret over the reported killing Monday of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. The statement appeared to put <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at odds with the pro-Iranian group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that claimed to have carried out <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' execution Then, on Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> indicated in a statement announcing a reprieve in the death sentence for American hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> that it was bowing to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s wishes. In the past, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has also linked improved relations to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> release of Iranian assets frozen after the seizure of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1979.

<TEXT>
 A paraplegic Park Service ranger who used only his arm strength to climb a 3,200-foot rock face in <LOCATION> Yosemite </LOCATION> presented President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag that he and his partner carried. `` This is great,'' the president told climber <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON>, who came to the Oval Office in his wheelchair. `` You certainly captured the imagination of the whole country.'' <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> later said the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> needs more federal money to spend on making the national parks accessible to the handicapped. But he said he did not have time in his brief meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to discuss such issues. `` We just need more attention brought to it,'' he told reporters after the meeting. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON>, a naturalist for the park service and director of Yosemite's program for the disabled, said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed the president's love of the outdoors and fishing. The 29-year-old climber, dressed in his park ranger uniform, and his fellow climber, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>, gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an American flag that was in the gear they cut loose before they reached the summit of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitan </LOCATION> on their climb of seven days and four hours. Also attending the meeting were <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorehead </PERSON>, associate director of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> completed the climb on July 26. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> hauled himself, six inches at a time, to the top of the cliff, one of Yosemite's most well-known landmarks. Their climb captured widespread media attention, including a news conference attended by some 55 reporters and rangers when they reached the summit. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON>, whose legs were paralyzed in a 1982 fall from another Yosemite peak, was the first paraplegic to make the vertical trek, doing 7,000 pullups on ropes placed by <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> chose a route that was almost straight up because it was more practical for him. The route included tackling the Shield Roof, a ledge jutting 40 feet out from the monolith at 2,000 feet above <LOCATION> Yosemite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> had to dangle beneath it and hoist themselves up a rope with the valley floor far below them.

 A plea bargain involving one misdemeanor charge each against the captain and owner of the tanker that spilled 300,000 gallons of oil off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> awaits only a judge's approval, a prosecutor said Friday <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> would not identify the charge or the penalties that the government will recommend, but said the charge carries a potential jail term and fines totaling twice the cleanup costs.

The tanker struck <PERSON> Brenton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reef </PERSON>, near the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, on June 23 and ruptured its hull. Most of the heating oil was quickly cleaned up or dissipated, but the spill killed dozens of young lobsters and crabs. Most beaches that were affected by the spill reopened within a week, but one in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> remains closed indefinitely because oil has soaked into the sand. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> has admitted he erred by not waiting for a harbor pilot familiar with the area. Almond and defense attorneys met for about 40 minutes with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> and said later they were waiting for the judge to set a court date to confirm the agreement. Almond said it could be as early as next week. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, free on $ 50,000 bail, did not attend the closed-door hearing. His attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFadyen </PERSON>, declined to comment on the case or say where his client was. `` He's being hounded terribly _ people pounding on his hotel room door at four in the morning,'' <PERSON> MacFadyen </PERSON> said. Almond said the cleanup costs on which the fine would be based had not yet been calculated, but added: `` You can rest assured they would be substantial, in excess of a million dollars.'' <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> was indicted last month on state felony charges of polluting coastal waters and failing to have a harbor pilot on board. He has not yet been arraigned on those charges.

 Rescuers crawled on their hands and knees up a mountain slope Friday to recover bodies and the flight recorder of an Olympic Airlines plane that slammed into the highest peak in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION>, killing 34 people. The twin-engine plane, circling in thick fog Thursday, hit 4,785-feet <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kerkis </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Kournies </LOCATION> region of this eastern <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> island off <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s southwest coast. The rescuers found remains of bodies and the aft section of the 30-seat British-built aircraft on an inaccessible slope of the mountain at 3,960 feet. The plane was split in half with debris scattered over a wide area. The front part of the plane had disintegrated when it hit the mountain, leaving only a black scar on the steep slope. Searchers said they found the flight recorder in the aft section of the aircraft, one of the few parts left intact. `` It appears that thick fog in the area at the time played the villain's role as the pilot flew blindly into the mountainside,'' said an airline official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He added that pilots fly `` visually'' on flights to small <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> islands that Olympic services. The rescuers approached the crash site early Friday, crawling on their hands and knees for 90 minutes up a steep slope in darkness. `` Unfortunately, we could do nothing,'' said <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlas </PERSON>, a doctor from a nearby village. `` I checked every body I could find. No immediate attempts were made to remove the bodies because of the inaccessible terrain, but managed to ferry out at least nine bodies later in the day. Officials did not say how many bodies were recovered. It was the first air crash for Olympic in 13 years. Officials said the propeller-driven plane had not experienced any serious problems since it went into service in 1981. There were 34 people aboard, including an infant, airline officials said. Officials said pilot <PERSON> Petros </PERSON> <PERSON> Moutzoureas </PERSON> was an hour into his domestic flight from <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> when he radioed his final position as he made his approach for landing. The plane disappeared from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION> radar screens when it was about 25 miles off the island's northwest coast. When it failed to land at 5:30 p.m., officials ordered and air and sea search. Transport and Communications Minister <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelestathis </PERSON> said all the victims were Greeks, although <PERSON> Yannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Orphanides </PERSON>, a Canadian of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> descent, said in <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION> that his parents, brother, wife and infant son _ all Canadians from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> _ were killed. The Canadian Embassy in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> said three other passengers who had booked their tickets in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> also could have been Canadian citizens. An embassy official said they were checking with their foreign office in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> to confirm their nationality.

<DATELINE>CENTRAL FALLS, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s smallest and poorest city, eager to relieve its financial crisis and downtrodden image, is staking its future on something nobody else wanted _ a trash incinerator. Other <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> communities have fought expensive legal battles against landfills and incinerators, but <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> offered Central Falls as a site for a state disposal plant in hopes of raising from $ 750,000 to $ 1.5 million a year in revenue from the state waste agency. The exact amount of revenue to be paid is under negotiation. Residents who voted for the incinerator in a July 25 referendum said they accepted <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s argument that it was the city's only available source of new cash, even though the plant faces a barrage of environmental hearings and can not open for at least three years. `` Nobody wants us. Everybody's trying to put us down and here's this man -LRB- the mayor -RRB- trying to boost us up by saying, ` Let's have the incinerator,''' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, who voted in favor `` I think we have to trust him.'' The incinerator, one of three waste-to-energy plants the state's <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is required to build, already has been rejected on environmental grounds by <LOCATION> Woonsocket </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION> Another plant, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION>, has been tied up in legal battles for 1 -LCB- years by residents and town officials who fear the pollution it could cause. Opponents of the Central Falls plant raised similar concerns, saying the state's smallest, most densely populated city, with an estimated 17,556 residents packed into 1.2 square miles, was no place for a trash incinerator. Some residents fear the 1,447-to-1 ,274 vote in favor of the plant means critics of the town will have a new reason to look down on it `` I work with a lot of people from neighboring communities and they say, ` Burn the city.' They think it's all druggies,'' said a 35-year-old nurse who voted against the incinerator. Officials in the neighboring communities of <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION> are threatening to do what they can to block the project, but the threats have added to the fighting spirit among those who remember the slights their city received from its neighbors over the years. `` I think it's good to put it on the <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION> line because they did n't regionalize the schools, and on the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> line because they would n't rent us their school,'' said the nurse. `` All the garbage trucks are going to go through their towns. I'm glad about that.'' The nurse, like some other residents, would discuss the volatile issue only anonymously for fear of antagonizing her neighbors. Central Falls has a large population of poor <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> immigrants crammed into decaying three-decker tenements and a 1980 median annual family income of $ 14,721, lowest in the state and far below the statewide median of $ 19,448 in 1980. The median home price, $ 100,000, is the lowest anywhere in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> except for the slums of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. The city raised taxes 18 percent recently trying to cope with potential deficits of $ 1.1 million this year and $ 400,000 next year caused by a stagnant tax base, federal revenue sharing cuts and a $ 1.5 million settlement with a man who claimed he was paralyzed by police brutality in the city jail. It was against that background that city leaders began campaigning to get the incinerator, saying that with virtually no open land left to develop, the city has no other way to boost its tax base. `` The dollars this facility is talking about would take something like 750 new homes to bring in,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brousseau </PERSON>. `` That's physically impossible.'' Opponents placed fliers throughout the city warning: `` Anyone who is living in Central Falls above the fourth floor will be even with the incinerator smokestack. You may have to keep your windows closed on nice days, depending on the direction of the wind.'' Those arguments, apparently aimed at residents of high-rise senior-citizen housing, did not impress elderly residents who remember when the incinerator site was used as a city dump and sewage filtration pond. `` Nobody died. Nobody got sick,'' said a 67-year-old man. `` They used to play baseball down there.'' <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, whose back yard is within view of the incinerator site, said she was also comforted by the track record of a nearby crematorium. `` You ca n't smell a thing,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 American military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> play a vital role in regional stability and should be maintained despite favorable changes in the Soviet political climate, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador said Friday. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> told a seminar at the University of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> that economic development in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> `` can not happen without security.'' `` There is a regional consensus that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security umbrella is as important now, even in this changing era, as it was before,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. `` If we are to have a successful new partnership, we will need continuing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in the security of this region,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. `` Our military facilities here in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are one element of the security equation.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are expected to begin preliminary talks this year on whether to extend the lease on the six American installations, which expires in 1991. After 1991, any extension must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition to the bases has been growing here. Several leading politicians have called for the bases to be closed in 1991 or phased out over a 10-year period. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to say whether she will support an extension. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said the economy of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> depends on trade and the bases play a vital role in protecting sea lanes. `` There is a balance between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. `` And the maintenance of that balance creates the stability that everybody is trying to preserve. The maintenance of that stability provides the background for the progress, the economic progress, that everybody wants.'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is undergoing political changes that `` are welcome to us. `` But we do n't think it is smart, and we do n't think it makes sense, to dismantle the alliance relationships that we have while we are assessing what these changes are.'' In a related development, Filipino diplomats said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional delegation will visit the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to look into the possibility of withdrawing some troops in the next few years. About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, civilian employees and military dependents are stationed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The diplomats said Reps. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> will arrive Aug. 11.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday hailed the inaugural session of the revamped Soviet legislature as a successful exercise in democracy that produced important laws and heralded the beginning of genuine oversight of government. `` The Supreme Soviet has become not a parade but a working legislative body,'' the president told lawmakers gathered in the Kremlin for the final day of the session. The Supreme Soviet once was dominated by Communist cogs who approved government proposals with no criticism. But under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms, the body was revamped into a full-time legislature with new powers of generating legislation and reviewing candidates for top government jobs. During the session that started June 26, the Supreme Soviet rejected several Cabinet nominees and approved legislation to increase pensions and grant a measure of economic independence to the Baltic republics. In earlier speeches, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called the Supreme Soviet and its larger parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a `` school of democracy.'' But he said Friday of the recent session: `` By its intensity, it was a whole university.'' Criticism came from Deputy <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gryazin </PERSON>, a constitutional law professor from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, who said the session was flawed by 20 major constitutional violations. He said one violation occurred Friday when it reversed an earlier rejection of <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Konarev </PERSON> for railway minister. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, who had nominated <PERSON> Konarev </PERSON> as well as half a dozen other Cabinet candidates rejected by the Supreme Soviet, told reporters he did not mind the oversight. He called it `` a big step forward in democratization and in the formation of a completely new system of government.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in his 40-minute address that the new legislature met during a stormy period, with `` not one quiet day'' as ethnic violence flared in several republics and hundreds of thousands of coal miners walked off their jobs. He pressed the legislature to approve a resolution strengthening the fight against a burgeoning crime rate. Later, legislators passed the resolution that will increase the number of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers `` in case of mass disobedience by criminal elements.'' It is the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers that have restored order when ethnic violence has broken out in several Soviet republics. Local ad hoc groups of police, prosecutors, and court officials will organize the anti-crime effort, and Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> will oversee it. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told reporters government ministers had canceled their summer holidays which traditionally begin in August to work on implementing the new legislation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the next session of the Supreme Soviet, which he said is scheduled to start Sept. 25, should adopt laws on property, leasing, taxation and strikes. Showing his political skill, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> deflated demands that constitutional changes be made before local elections are held. The <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> group, whose leaders include <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, had wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to meet soon to adopt changes that would ensure local elections would be completely democratic <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a proposal <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> welcomed, suggested the changes be informally approved by deputies in a poll and that local authorities be guided by them in holding the elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would then meet in a scheduled session in December, deputies said.

 Two education leaders said Friday it will take money as well as leadership to turn President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into the education president he has said he wants to be. `` As long as there is a budget deadlock and the administration has its hands tied by its own budget policies, it's going to be very difficult for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be the education president,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges and universities. <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON>, president of the 830-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, said they hope <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s education summit next month with the nation's governors will include higher education as well as the elementary and secondary grades. `` There are very serious problems'' in higher education, <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said, among them `` an incredible need for science facilities'' and more federal money for research support and student aid. `` It can not be simply leadership at the national level. It's got to be money,'' he said. <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said higher education did not fare as well as the lower grades in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill for fiscal 1990 that passed earlier this week. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations overall are really quite insufficient and could do great damage to students,'' <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON> said. `` We're going to be working very hard to do better in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in higher education than we did in the House.'' <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> also pledged to continue fighting for a separate aid program for students at for-profit schools, which have a loan default rate four times as high as the 9 percent average for four-year institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee said it was concerned about sky-high default rates at some trade schools and said there would be `` a full review'' of defaults and other problems in the financial aid program next year when the Higher Education Act comes up for reapproval. The for-profit schools are attracting an ever-greater proportion of grants and loans, some of them for classes of dubious value or students with dubious ability, educators say. The shift prompted <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON>'s controversial call for a separate aid program and has also resulted in colleges and universities devoting more of their own resources to campus-based student aid. <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said school-sponsored aid rose from $ 900 million in 1979 to $ 3.5 billion in the past year at the private, non-profit schools he represents. <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said faculty salaries still do n't match the purchasing power they had in 1972 while `` staff salaries are much lower and probably in much worse shape.'' In addition, he said, schools are spending money on science equipment that ca n't wait and a whole array of new services designed to meet student needs and help schools stay competitive _ career placement departments, security forces, drug and alcohol abuse programs, and counselors to help minority students and others with special needs.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s left-leaning government said Friday it wants to improve the environment by reducing flights in and out of the city, but federal authorities say that could increase West Berliners' isolation. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s government, headed by the Social Democrats in a coalition with the environmentalist Alternative List, proposes that 36 daily flights be eliminated from <LOCATION> Tegel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>'s schedule, spokesman <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolhoff </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Kolhoff </PERSON> told the radio station Sender Freies <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that the plan, which would cut commercial air traffic by about 15 percent, is aimed at cutting down on noise and exhaust emissions from jetliners servicing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s transportation minister, says that while the number of commercial flights increased 23.6 percent in 1988 from the previous year, the number of passengers increased only 6.2 percent in the same period. Die Welt, the conservative daily, said `` low-load'' flights would be affected by the reduction, meaning flights that do not normally carry many passengers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> formally administer <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> under post-World War II agreements and would have to approve the proposal. The federal government also must be consulted. The three Allied air attaches probably will meet with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and federal officials next week to discuss the matter, said an Allied official in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON>, a federal government spokesman, said the cut in flights could run counter to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Initiative of former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who while he was in office called for improved access to the divided city. <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said air traffic `` is the only uncontrolled access to the city'' and that a major reduction of flights would have a `` pyschological'' effect on residents of the Western enclave surrounded by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON>, a federal lawmaker with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal sends a `` dangerous signal'' and would be a serious setback for the city <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, a leading official with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s Bavarian sister party, said the plan `` bears the clear signature of the alternatives -LRB- Alternative List -RRB-, who want to turn <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> into an island uncoupled from the Federal Republic.'' Allied civil air officials based in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said the Allied civil air attaches `` must weigh the needs of the traveling public and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> population as well as commercial and practical aviation considerations. `` The Allies intend to ensure that the high quality of aviation services in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> will be maintained and that measures to protect the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> environment will be implemented as appropriate,'' the officials said. People can also reach <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by vehicle and by train, which must pass through East German border control points. Officials say about 7,000 flights in and out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are scheduled every month, averaging about 220 a day. Flights in June had about 400,000 passengers.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to provide <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> with $ 10 million in food aid, the first such assistance since the failed elections of November 1987, it was announced Friday. Under terms of an agreement signed Thursday in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> will receive about 45,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, which it will sell on the local market. Proceeds will be used for development projects. In making the announcement, which was first reported Thursday on Haitian television, the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved the new aid in recognition of continuing progress by the interim government of Gen.

The decision also was based on <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in narcotics interdiction efforts, AID said. The Haitian government canceled the November 1987 national elections after an outburst of violence on the morning of the balloting claimed at least 50 dead and dozens wounded. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration suspended $ 62 million in economic aid hours after <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> disbanded the national electoral council. The only assistance provided since then has been for an anti-narcotics program and for emergency aid following Hurricane Gilbert last year.

 A barrage of rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Friday, killing one person, injuring eight people and ending a three-day lull in attacks on the Afghan capital, the government said. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said nine rockets pounded the capital and most fell on the <LOCATION> Duralaman </LOCATION> district, where the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters, and the nearby residential area of Cart-i-Se. He gave a casualty toll of one killed and eight injured. The Afghan news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> said 19 rockets fell on the city, killing one civilian and injuring four others. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said later he could not find out whether the figure of 19 was correct because government offices are closed on Friday. Officials at <LOCATION> Avicina </LOCATION> emergency hospital said one rocket hit the mountain below the the Afghan TV broadcasting tower and one fell in <LOCATION> Cart-i-Char </LOCATION> district near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> University. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> hospital said five injured persons were brought there from Cart-i-Se and <LOCATION> Cart-i-Char </LOCATION> districts. This city of 2.25 million people had been subjected to almost daily rocketing until earlier this week. Between June 25 and Aug. 1, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said 281 people were killed and 745 injured in rocket attacks and a car bombing. Nearly all victims were civilians. Afghan security forces launched a major search operation in and around the capital Monday night and no rockets fell on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> until Friday. During the operation, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said, security forces confiscated 100 Egyptian-made and Chinese-made rockets. <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> quoted a security source as saying that from Tuesday to Thursday, the air force flew 380 missions over areas where they suspected there were enemy batteries. Supported by artillery and rockets, the air force carried out attacks on the <LOCATION> Paghman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and in a 15-mile area east and southeast of the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. It quoted the security source as saying the government plans to expand the security belt around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to prevent rocket attacks. Most rockets used against <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have a range of less than 20 miles, though longer range rockets also have been launched. No group has claimed responsibility for the recent attacks against <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, though U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to oust President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Soviet-backed government have said they were responsible for previous rocketing. The guerrillas say they aim at military targets and blame the government for attacks on schools, markets, bus stops and other civilian targets _ an allegation vehemently denied by the government.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> movement Friday affirmed its support for the declaration of a Palestinian state and the recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, the Palestinian news agency reported. The declarations were contained in a program adopted in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament in exile. A third element, renunciation of terrorism, also was supported by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Wafa </ORGANIZATION> said. About 1,000 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main component of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, are meeting behind closed doors in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters. At the congress, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had been expected to come under fire from <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> members who opposed concessions to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Wafa </ORGANIZATION> dispatch suggested he was able to beat back the challenge. The second day of the congress was characterized by `` a frank and animated discussion concerning internal and political problems, which shows that the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> movement has restored its unity and solidarity,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wafa </ORGANIZATION> said. The congress opened Thursday and was expected to last about five days. <ORGANIZATION> Wafa </ORGANIZATION> said participants called for support for the intefadeh, or Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied territories. The delegates accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of `` a policy of the iron fist against the Palestinian people in order to neutralize the intefadeh.'' Fatah spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> said the congress decided not to admit any non-Palestinian reporters, and foreign reporters were not allowed in the vicinity of the <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> congress hall where the meeting was held. Several Palestinian reporters were allowed into the meeting but remained silent about the proceedings. The Tunisian news agency said only 980 of the 1,059 congress delegates were in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Friday but that others were arriving from many parts of the world. The congress set up its group of officers and divided into committees for discussion of its main topics. The essential point on the agenda was the nomination of 10 central committee members. Since the last <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, five members have either been assassinated or joined more militant <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions, and five new seats have been added to the central committee.

 Lawyers for the state of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> said Friday that they are appealing a federal judge's ruling that a 70-year-old state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice can not be forced to retire because of his age. Lawyers for the state of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on Friday filed a notice in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION> that the case was being appealed to the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At issue is whether a federal law prohibiting age discrimination applies to appointed state judges. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagliardi </PERSON> ruled last month that it does and struck down a state order that Justice <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> retire. His ruling, in effect, nullified a section of the Vermont Constitution that requires all judges to retire at age 70. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> turned 70 last December, but refused to retire and filed suit when the state ordered that he do so. Lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, representing the state, said he filed a notice in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION> that the state was appealing to the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The decision by the district court is inconsistent with other rulings on the question and we feel it appropriate that the issue be addressed by the 2nd Circuit,'' he said. Even though <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> won in the first round, he said he welcomed the appeal. `` I think it is fair to say that both sides want this to go as high as it can,'' said the justice, one of five on <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s only appeals court `` The higher it goes, the greater an impact it will have,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. `` What we really hope is that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will agree to hear this so that we can finally settle the question once and for all.'' <PERSON> Gagliardi </PERSON>'s ruling within the territory covered by the 2nd Circuit conflicts with rulings by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the 1st <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which said the federal law prohibiting discrimination does not apply to appointed state judges. `` We believe that the confusion coming out of these cases may make it more attractive for the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Supreme -RRB- court to agree to hear this,'' said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. The disagreement is whether the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act supersedes state mandatory retirement provisions for judges. The law prohibits age discrimination, but excludes certain groups from the provision. The <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, argues that judges do n't fall under any of the exceptions. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> argues that judges fall under the exception granted for policymakers, and that the Constitution requires <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to state its intention clearly when it wants to regulate qualifications for such important state offices as judges. `` I expect our brief will address both the interpretation of the statute and the constitutional implications,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. If the ruling stands under appeal, <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> can remain on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> until his term expires in three years. He could also seek another six-year term.

 Anti-apartheid church leaders said Friday they will play a leading role in a mass defiance campaign that is likely to intensify in the days leading up to segregated elections Sept. 6. `` The defiance campaign expresses the will of the majority of our population whilst the elections will reflect the concerns of a very small proportion of South Africans,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said on behalf of the South African Council of Churches. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s tricameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has separate houses for the 5 million whites, 3 million people of mixed race and a million Asians, but excludes the 28 million-member black majority. Protests began Wednesday when 270 blacks and <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> sought and received treatment at segregated white hospitals. There were no incidents despite government warnings the campaign will lead to violence. The Council of Churches, which includes almost all leading Protestant denominations, said future protests `` will be initiated by the church, others will be supported by the church.'' Churchmen said the new protests will be launched later this month but declined details. Its supporters hope the defiance campaign will be the largest civil disobedience action in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since the 1950s. It has been organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a loose coalition replacing the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which was the country's largest anti-apartheid federation when it was banned last year Police made no attempt to confront protesters on Wednesday. Authorities have not said how they will respond in the future, though Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said such activities `` are a time-bomb that could explode at any moment.'' Election campaigns in recent years have been marked by numerous bombings and there have been several attacks in the past two weeks in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The only fatality has been a man planting a bomb that exploded on a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> railroad line. Several other people have been wounded. No one has claimed responsibility, but police blame the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, which has called for a boycott of the mixed-race and Asian elections. Also Friday, the church leaders condemned 16 British cricket players who have agreed to tour <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1990 and 1991. `` I think it is an obscenity for them to come to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at this stage of our crisis,'' said Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. White South African sports officials have hailed the tour as a major breakthrough in the international sports boycot imposed to protest <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s legal policy of race discrimination.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Friday offered to withdraw 1,500 troops a week if the largest Tamil guerrilla group observes a cease-fire, government sources said. Police said a strike called Friday by Sinhalese radicals to protest 150 deaths disrupted normal life in the island nation, and at least 15 people died in ethnic violence since Thursday, including a Bhuddist priest. About 45,000 Indian troops are in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce a July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending a Tamil ethnic strife in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> republic, where the government is dominated by the Sinhalese majority. Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry sources said the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> offer came Friday before the two sides ended a weeklong talk in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> aimed at finding ways to make <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> withdraw its troops. `` At this moment I can say that the talks went on well,'' Sri Lankan High Commissioner, or Ambassador S.S.P.P. <PERSON> Kalpage </PERSON> said. `` There are proposals and counter-proposals, and also there are ifs and buts,'' <PERSON> Kalpage </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the Indian capital. But Sri Lankian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw 1,500 troops a week provided the main Tamil guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, observed a cease-fire and that no Indians are attacked. The withdrawal also was conditional on <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> agreeing to give more powers to the Tamil adminstration in the north and east of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where Tamils are a majority. Indian government officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> were not available for comment on the proposal. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said that a hasty withdrawal could cause even more bloodshed. Sinhalese-language posters signed by the guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> warned businesses to close Friday to protest the killing of 150 people by security forces a week ago. Police and witnesses said the daylong strike appeared to be successful as the usually-bustling capital was deserted. Shops and offices were closed and vehicles stayed off the street. At least 150 people were killed July 28 when supporters of the radicals defied a nationwide curfew and demonstrated against the continued presence of Indian troops. Sinhalese radicals also oppose the autonomy plan for Tamils. The government had said curfew violators would be shot on sight to prevent what it calls a campaign of terror by the militants. The curfew remains in effect from dusk to dawn. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, two Sinhalese men were killed Friday when a bomb they were carrying exploded in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said. A Sinhalese woman was killed when troops fired at her vehicle which it did not stop at a checkpoint. The priest, <PERSON> Kotikawatte </PERSON> <PERSON> Saddhatissa </PERSON>, was killed Thursday night by six gunmen in a <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> temple, police said. The gunmen were suspected members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Saddhatissa </PERSON>, 72, a supporter of President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, is the second religious leader to be killed by the radicals. In February, the front's gunmen killed <PERSON> Bodaramulle </PERSON> <PERSON> Subitha </PERSON>, the head priest of the <LOCATION> Kalutara </LOCATION> temple, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Six Indian soldiers and five Tamil Tiger militants were killed in a gunbattle in the northern <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> peninsula on Thursday, said <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Some civilians were also killed, they said. Authorities blame the Sinhalese radicals for at least 4,000 killings and a series of crippling strikes since the start of an anti-government uprising two years ago. At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed in the 6-year-old Tamil insurgency. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the peace plan because of pressures from its own 60 million Tamils who are sympathetic to the rebel cause. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, have been fighting for an independent nation since 1983, claiming they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military.

 Former House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was spending almost $ 100,000 a month on lawyers to defend himself against ethics charges that consumed his final three months in office, his campaign finance reports show. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s campaign finance reports, filed this week with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, show that from March until May, he spent $ 282,000 to pay his lawyers from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Manatt </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Last year, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> paid $ 78,734 to the firm, his records show. That would bring the total to $ 360,734 from October through May. Shortly before <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> announced in May that he would abandon his defense and resign, his supporters launched a fund-raising effort to cover legal bills said at the time to be approaching $ 500,000.

However, under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, his departure means no such public disclosure of the fund is required. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did non return telephone calls Friday to discuss the fund. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> relinquished the speaker's gavel and left the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in June.

<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1854, <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> docked his ships at <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> and, in telling of the wonders of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, mentioned the monument being built in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in memory of `` the great mandarin,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. And, lo, the people of the Kingdom of <LOCATION> Ryukyu </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> _ contributed a large stone from a quarry along with a 15th century temple bell. The stone was to be placed into the wall of the monument along with other commemorative stones and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> planned to hang the bell at the top of the monument. The bell made it to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; the stone did n't. But nobody noticed because by then the money to build the monument had run out and it resembled a tree stump for another 25 years. Besides, a civil war and other matters occupied <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Fast forward 130 years to 1984. The <ORGANIZATION> Ryukyu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> civic organization, comes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to see the famous <PERSON> Ryukyu </PERSON> stone and discovers it is n't there Now it is the first Friday in August 1989. The temperature is 94 degrees, almost too hot even for tourists. At a ceremony on the south side of the monument a replacement stone is unveiled by two of 10 students who came from <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> for the occasion. `` This is a very important day for <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Yukiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Koja </PERSON>, one of the student delegates. `` This stone is important because it symbolizes our long friendship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The Japanese ambassador, the honorable <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, calls the occasion `` joyful'' and speaks of it as a cornerstone of future development of cooperation. Eight dancers in kimonos do the traditional opening dance of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> as a record plays music. The lyrics are translated to `` today's happiness can be compared with the blossoming of a flower when touched by dew.'' Retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineau </PERSON>, who organized <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>'s papers in the 1960s, tells the gathering that the last mention of the original stone was when it was transferred in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> When <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> received the stone from the <LOCATION> Okinawan </LOCATION> people, he said, there also was a bill for $ 80. Embarrassed Okinawan officials, <PERSON> Pineau </PERSON> said, apparently said they would take care of it. The new stone measures two feet by four feet by three inches and weighs 396 pounds. Part of it was hollowed out for 53 pebbles from nine <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> cities and 44 villages. It will be the 193rd commemorative stone in the monument, only 15 of them from foreign countries. It will be placed at the 310-foot level where the only people who will see it are those who make arrangements to go down the stairs of the 555-foot monument. As for the <ORGANIZATION> Gokokuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> _ it was never put in the monument. Instead it was on display at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, until 1986 when it was returned to the people of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> as a gesture of good will.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports Drop in Party Membership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist Party membership dropped by 35,000 in the first half of 1989 and the party has lost more than 1 million members in the last decade, a leading party weekly reported. The article in the Saturday edition of <LOCATION> Polityka </LOCATION> also pointed out that nearly one-fifth of party members are retirees and that workers are a minority in the party, whose formal name is the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Party membership stands just below 2.1 million, compared to 3.15 million in 1980, the article said, and most members occupy management posts. The article noted that the communist coalition received only about 25 percent of the vote for the freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in June. `` So it is a minority, though a significant minority.'' This year, 42,000 members left the party, while only 7,000 joined. Among those who left, 11,500 quit, 8,800 were dropped from party rolls for showing `` lack of interest in party life,'' 8,000 changed jobs and did not re-register with the party at their new workplaces and 1,300 emigrated. The article did not specify what accounted for the remaining drop. The article quoted party documents as estimating only one-fourth of the party membership is active, 60 percent do not meet the party's rules for minimum participation and the remainder is generally `` passive.'' About one-third of the party membership thinks other political groups do more to aid society's interests than the party does, and about the same number do not believe it will be able to work out a program that will keep it in power past 1993, the article said. Under this year's accords, fully democratic elections are to be held that year. The article said retirees now account for a record 17.6 percent of the membership and the average age of a party member is 46 compared to 40 in 1980. Although it claims to be the party of the working class, only 37.5 percent of the party are workers, compared with 52.1 percent who are in the intelligentsia _ which refers to professions requiring higher education such as managers, teachers, professors, journalists, doctors and lawyers. The rest are in agriculture.

 The acting head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> regional office is being transferred to agency headquarters pending the outcome of three investigations of her conduct, a department official said Friday. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> was told to report to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> effective Monday and will be assigned to nonmanagerial duties in the department's office of housing, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> last month placed <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> on administrative leave from her $ 68,500-a-year job because of questions about her role in awarding federal subsidies to housing in <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a small beachfront village that is home to Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, R-N.Y. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON>, who in addition to her <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> job served as a village trustee, and other <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> officials have been accused of rigging the distribution of HUD-subsidized houses in the early 1980s, ensuring that they went to politically connected townspeople instead of minorities, as the program intended. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON>'s son purchased one of the houses although he did not qualify under <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, according to a 1984 investigation by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general. A cousin of <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s also bought one of the houses, although the senator maintains that he played no role and that the man was qualified. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> has also been accused of voting on HUD-related matters before the town board. She has denied casting such votes but the former town clerk recently said he was ordered to alter minutes to show <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> had abstained. Her conduct is being investigated by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> wrote to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> on Thursday asking for a quick resolution of the investigation and information about its scope. `` We are anxious to resolve her status as an employee but obviously can not do so as long as your investigation is under way,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> last month prohibited <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> managers from serving on government boards and said all <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees will be barred from serving on government or other panels that could have HUD-related dealings or benefit from agency programs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> was told she will be reassigned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for up to 120 days, the official said. The department had to make the move because it can put an employee on administrative leave for only 30 days. She is the highest-ranking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official to be affected in a number of recent personnel moves related to the investigations of abuse, influence-peddling and mismanagement. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has initiated the process of firing three former officials at its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office, including the office's former head, because of alleged mismanagement. The head of the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, field office also was recently reassigned to nonmanagerial duties. As acting head of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> regional office, <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> was repsonsible for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs and officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

 Final autopsy results Friday failed to explain the death of an aviation officer candidate from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> during an abandon-ship drill in a training pool, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died of `` a seizure disorder of unknown cause accompanied by acute cerebral edema,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which has its headquarters at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. `` The autopsy found no indication of trauma, pre-existing disease or congenital abnormalities and no evidence of hemorrhage,'' <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. Although inconclusive, the autopsy was still valuable because it did exclude those possible causes, he said. <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> also said the autopsy by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pathology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, did not change a preliminary finding that no wrongdoing is indicated in the June 23 death. That was not the case in the death last year of another <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> trainee, also in a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> training pool. Five enlisted instructors were punished, including one sentenced to 90 days in the brig for negligent homicide, and an officer was reprimanded for the March 2, 1988, death of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was undergoing rescue-swimmer training when he panicked during a strenuous rescue drill, climbed from the pool and shouted that he was quitting Court-martial testimony indicated he had an unusual fear of being pushed under water and suffered heart failure and drowned after instructors pushed him back in the pool and held his head under water. The death of <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> drew unusual attention because of the previous <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> investigation, which was pressed by <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s congressman after complaints were raised by his family about the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the case <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> died during a different type of drill, one in which aviation trainees jump off a 12-foot tower and swim about 15 yards under water while wearing their flight suits. Most sailors go through similar drills during basic training. <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> completed the exercise and was walking from the pool when he collapsed back into shallow water, witnesses said. Medical examiners said there was little doubt of a seizure, but they were uncertain whether it was triggered by the central nervous or cardiovascular systems, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Premier Says Mine Settlement Will Cost $3 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's concessions to improve living and working conditions for hundreds of thousands of coal miners will cost more than $ 3 billion, Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told official media that coming up with that sum will be difficult for the financially strapped government, and cautioned other workers not to expect the same concessions if they walk off their jobs. The package of financial measures `` is not an easy one, and it will require mobilization of the financial and material resources of the country,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said in an interview on state-run television. `` If we follow the road of strikes, no one will benefit from it, and low-paid sections of the population will be hit first,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted him as saying. `` One should understand that if others follow the miners' example, the country may find itself in a most difficult situation.'' The current package will cost 2 billion rubles -LRB- $ 3.2 billion -RRB-. Previous estimates of the cost of the package ranged up to 5 billion rubles -LRB- $ 8 billion. -RRB- <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the government had put together a series of measures, many of which were submitted to the Supreme Soviet legislature, which ended its first session Friday. The legislature presumably will be able to approve those measures only when it resumes its work Sept. 25. Hundreds of thousands of miners in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> walked off their jobs in July in frustration over poor living and working conditions. They returned to work after the government promised improvements. Miners of 17 mines in the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> coal region of western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> went on strike for two hours Thursday because they said the government was not living up to its pledge to halt the operation of a hydroelectric station they say is harming the environment.

 Two more politicians of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> declared their candidacies Friday in next week's election to choose <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new prime minister, throwing open what once looked like a walkover election Former Welfare Minister <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, 62, and former Transport Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, 56, a prominent author, said they will seek the party presidency in Tuesday's balloting. Until Friday, former Education Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, had been considered a shoo-in for the job. The party president is assured of becoming prime minister because of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' large majority in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which selects the prime minister. The winner Tuesday will be <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third prime minister since June. The party has been crippled by an unpopular new sales tax and money and sex scandals. <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was forced to resign in June. <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> announced he would resign after only two months in office following July 23 elections in which the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost their majority in the upper chamber for the first time since the party's formation in 1955. `` Our party must reform itself radically and reform politics with an eye toward the future,'' <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> told a news conference late Friday. `` I am determined to devote myself entirely to the task.'' <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> also called for party reforms and said, `` Politics do not exist for politicians, but for the country. If we leave the situation as it is now, factionalism and power politics will continue to prevail.'' <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> asked party members on Friday to refrain from factionalism in the presidential race. Half a dozen major factions in the party are separated more by personal and financial allegiances than their conservative political leanings. The large faction led by former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> decided on Friday to support <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, who belongs to one of the party's smallest groups. <PERSON> Seiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohta </PERSON>, a leading member of the <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> faction, branded <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s candidacy a product of back room deals involving large factions. `` It will disappoint the public,'' he said. Analysts said <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> remains the front-runner because of strong backing from factions led by former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>. The party's popular No. 2 official, <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, 52, formally declined to run Friday, saying his candidacy would further split the party. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Ganri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>, 68, had said he would run, but had to drop out Friday when he failed to draw enough support from party members to become a candidate. He said he and his supporters would back <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Committee Proposes Charges Against Former Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> committee proposed Friday that a minister of the former Socialist government be charged with complicity in an agricultural fraud that cheated the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The 12-member committee investigated whether <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Athanassopoulos </PERSON>, former deputy finance minister, was involved in the alleged forgery of harbor logs and customs invoices to show that 9,000 tons of Yugoslav maize sold to the Community in 1986 was from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member. In May, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issued a ruling against <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, citing lost revenues to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> of $ 1.16 million. The sentence is expected to be announced later this year. <PERSON> Athanassios </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsaldaris </PERSON>, speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said floor debate on the committee's proposal would take place late this month. After inconclusive elections in June, communists and conservatives formed a coalition government to prosecute those involved in several financial scandals that arose during the Socialist administration of former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>. They said the coalition probably would stay in office only about three months. The committee report indicated <PERSON> Athanassopoulos </PERSON> had tried to cover up for whoever was behind the scheme, which defrauded the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> of import duties on the maize and caused it to pay subsidies for produce from a nonmember nation. All five Socialist members of committee voted against the proposal, which was supported by the six members from the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party and the single deputy from the Coalition of the Left and Progress, which is dominated by the Communist party. New Democracy has claimed the $ 1.16 million obtained by the state-run ITCO trading company in the fraud is missing. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> denies it.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> expressed hope Friday that the hostage crisis can be ended when pro-Iranian radicals provide specifics of their demands. He defended the action that precipitated the crisis: <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of a spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, an Iranian-sponsored Shiite Moslem group believed responsible for the kidnappings of Westerners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had the right to act on its own to rescue its captured soldiers whether the rest of the world agrees or not. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to trade <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and other Lebanese Shiite prisoners for three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The prime minister and other top officials consulted on a response to the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which suspended its plans to kill an American hostage Thursday night and made new demands on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was `` waiting for proposals'' from the captors of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, who issued a statement saying they would provide a list of `` Palestinian and Lebanese'' prisoners to be released. `` We hope we will get some proposals and it will be the end of the crisis,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders had hoped to receive a response within hours, but now are convinced it will take much longer. `` A prisoners exchange with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is a complicated affair, and it would last for a long time before a solution is found,'' it quoted Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as saying. On Monday, three days after commandos abducted <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> from his home in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a group of kidnappers calling themselves the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> said they had hanged Lt. Col <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in retaliation. They released a poor-quality videotape of a man who appeared to be the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> colonel hanging from a gallows, but there was no way of knowing when the tape was made. Some reports have said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, kidnapped in February 1988 while on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, had been killed months ago. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, was quoted as saying Friday the first step toward ending the crisis would be for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to ask <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> claims <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> planned guerrilla attacks against it and directed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' kidnapping Israeli analysts said the developments indicate a willingness by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> radicals to consider releasing hostages, and that vindicates <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision to kidnap <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> put the issue of hostages back on the international agenda,'' said <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Avineri </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> director-general. Until the current crisis, `` the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> accepted people being captured by bandits and had come to believe nothing could be done about it,'' he said. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazit </PERSON>, a former military intelligence chief, said the abduction triggered a new willingness by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to consider trading hostages. Without it, `` nothing would have happened and all the existing hostages would be in the same hopeless situation as before.'' <PERSON> Gazit </PERSON> said it also `` put the Israeli hostages on the agenda and that was the exact purpose.'' A government official said privately he doubted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> without something in return, and did not believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would ask that. `` If it's only freeing <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, what do the Americans get out of it; what do we get out of it?'' he said. The statement from <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s kidnappers repeated <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> must be released and added the demand for `` a number of'' Palestinians and Lebanese. It did not say what would happen to <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> if the Israelis refuse. More than 8,000 Palestinians have been jailed since an uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began 20 months ago in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also has more than 60 <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> prisoners and its allied militiamen in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed to hold 300 more. While <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has proposed an exchange of Shiite captives for the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and 16 Western hostages, eight of them Americans, Israeli officials continue emphasizing that the first objective is freeing the soldiers. On <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as saying he believed negotiations on freeing the soldiers were closer. Asked about freedom for the foreigners, he replied: `` If it will happen we will be very happy.'' The radio quoted officials as saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would leave it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to ensure the safety of the American and other hostages. In his defense of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jewish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Appeal </LOCATION> that Jewish tradition requires <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s unrelenting efforts to free its captured soldiers `` We have no alternative but to apply pressure'' on the `` most sensitive nerves'' of those holding them. `` Of course, we would prefer to have the civilized world participating actively with us,'' the prime minister said. `` In any case, we will stay our course.''

<HEAD>EPA Bans Ant Killer as Danger to Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Friday banned household ant killers containing the chemical sodium arsenate because of the danger of small children ingesting the compounds. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the chemical is used to kill ants that are merely a nuisance and do not threaten human health, food crops or wood structures. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said the product is a surgary liquid made by several companies and sold under numerous brand names. He said that because the purchaser normally applies the ant killer and leaves it exposed, it is not child-proof. Most often, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said, the compound is applied to carboard, wax paper, bottle caps or food to attract ants. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>, who wrote the order banning the pesticide, said that manufacturers of such compounds have failed to show `` that the benefits of continued use of open sodium arsenate baits to control household ants justifies the risks to human health associated with the baits, particularly the risk to small children.'' In other action, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it had reached agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a case involving violatios of federal clean air requirements at the company's <LOCATION> Androscoggin </LOCATION> mill in <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The settlement, part of a consent decree, calls for the company to pay a $ 900,000 fine for air pollution and begin a program to reduce emissions from the plant. The agreement involved federal and state environmental officials and the paper company. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also announced a proposed $ 253,200 fine against <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for its failure to promptly report to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> test results on a new chemical even though the tests indicated the chemical may pose a risk to public health. The agency said the test results were provided the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> five years late. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> may appeal the proposed fine and request a formal hearing, officials said. The chemical is called <ORGANIZATION> Santogard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PVI </ORGANIZATION> and is used in the processing of natural and synthetic products.

<HEAD>Denver Symphony Will Play Sharply Reduced Season</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The financially plagued <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> is making plans to play this season after all, thanks to a survival plan approved Friday that includes shortening the season by half and cutting musicians' salaries. The final two months of last season were canceled because of lack of money, and observers had thought the odds were good the upcoming season would be canceled outright. Terms of the plan approved by the orchestra's board include negotiating pay cuts and concessions from its 81 musicians, cutbacks in staff and operating costs, and winning writeoffs of $ 3.2 million of the symphony's $ 4 million debt. The 1989-90 symphony season, which usually lasts 41 weeks and begins in September, was pruned to 21 weeks and will begin Jan. 21, 1990. The board approved a $ 3.5 million budget for the limited season, down from last season's $ 7.3 million. `` Although we regret the need to shorten the season, we feel this is the financially prudent way to proceed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>. He said that the season could still be canceled if the orchestra's creditors refuse to forgive the debts. `` I want to emphasize I am optimistic about getting that debt forgiven,'' he said. But if the goal of $ 3.2 million in forgiven debts is not reached, he said, `` we're going to have to look very hard at what that does to our ability to proceed.'' Among the debts is $ 700,000 owed to the city for back rent for <PERSON> Boettcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Some city council members have said they would oppose any debt forgiveness. Earlier in the summer, the board rejected a proposed 27-week season that was to have begun in November, citing the unresolved $ 4 million debt and the fact that musicians had not agreed to contract concessions. Earlier this week, the symphony notified its musicians that their health and dental benefits were canceled, saving the association about $ 30,000 a month. Three years ago the musicians agreed to 20 percent pay cuts to keep the symphony solvent. The symphony's financial problems have been blamed on <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s recession, the city's 10 percent seat tax, continual turnover in management and the $ 600,000-a-month cash flow needed to operate the symphony

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just weeks before the mayoral primary, a former top aide to Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has been indicted on charges he lied when he denied that a city agency he ran was really a patronage mill, a prosecutor said Friday. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON>, 46, indicted on 11 counts of perjury, ran the city's <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, set up ostensibly to recruit women and minorities to fill city posts. Critics said the agency was really used to handle patronage requests, and doled out the highest paying jobs to whites. The indictment said <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> lied when he told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> at a public hearing that politically connected job applicants were not given preference for city government posts. Other witnesses contradicted this. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherkasky </PERSON>, who announced the indictment, noted at a news conference that patronage is not illegal and said there was no underlying crime in the case. But he said the grand jury found that <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> committed perjury by lying to cover up his patronage dealings at commission hearings on July 13 and 21 last year and Jan. 11 this year. The indictment was filed Thursday, <PERSON> Cherkasky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> pleaded innocent at his arraignment and was released on his own recognizance. A hearing was scheduled for Aug. 11. The indictment comes less than six weeks before the primary election in which <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is seeking the Democratic nomination for an unprecedented fourth term. His opponents sought to capitalize on the indictment but <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> declared: `` I do n't think it does anything to my campaign. There's nothing to hide here.'' The Koch administration has been shaken by several scandals, particularly since his election to a third term in November 1985. Six of the mayor's appointees have been jailed and about 200 lower-level city employees have been convicted of various crimes. The scandals have ranged from the serious _ kickbacks from collection agencies hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Parking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> _ to the trivial _ the chef at the mayoral <ORGANIZATION> Gracie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mansion </ORGANIZATION> used city equipment for his catering business. <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, a city commissioner, was acquitted of charges she tried to fix her boyfriend's divorce case. Speaking about the <LOCATION> Job </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Friday that compared with patronage at the state capital in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the use of patronage in his administration `` is piddling and legal.'' But <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said lying to the commission is `` simply unacceptable'' and that he would have counseled <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> to tell the truth. Some witnesses testified to the commission that files at the Talent Bank were sometimes marked with color codes, indicating a political sponsor might have referred an applicant to <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON>. His own assistant, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hein </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> had ordered him in February 1986 to `` cleanse'' the computer and paper employment files of `` any references to political figures.'' Six month ago, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> announced that he had asked for <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON>'s resignation But <PERSON> DeVincenzo </PERSON> had already filed papers to resign, ensuring his pension of $ 52,000 a year. District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said his office did consider the timing of the indictment, so close to the election, but conlcuded that `` we could not be in the role of censor, deciding what the public could and could not hear.'' First-degree perjury is punishable by a maximum of seven years in prison.

<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on Friday hailed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court decision restoring looted mosaics to his church as opening the way for the recovery of stolen archaelogical treasures worldwide. `` We are overjoyed by the decision of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> court,'' said <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON>, head of the Greek Orthodox church in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` This encourages us to seek the recovery of other looted treasures because it will discourage international art merchants who deal in such stolen property,'' he said in an interview. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> ruled Thursday that four 6th-century mosaics purchased by an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> art dealer were the property of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> church and should be returned to it. But attorneys for both sides were unable to reach an agreement on when the artwork would be released, and they were back before <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> late Friday afternoon. In his ruling Thursday, <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> said dealer <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> never obtained title to the mosaics, which she bought last summer in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The ruling did not address damages, custody or transfer of the mosaics, which remained locked in an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> vault while attorneys negotiated for their release. The mosaics depict the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and the apostles. They were removed from the walls of the church of The Virgin of <LOCATION> Kanakaria </LOCATION> in the village of <LOCATION> Lythrangomi </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which has been under Turkish occupation since 1974. Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, bought the mosaics from a Turkish middleman, <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dikmen </PERSON>, for $ 1.1 million and offered them for sale to the <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for $ 20 million. The <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government has accused Turkish authorities and the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> of allowing the systematic looting of churches and rich archaelogical sites to eradicate the Christian and Greek cultural heritage of the island, going back more than three thousand years. The <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> church and the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government sued for the recovery of the mosaics when informed by the Getty museum of the development. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> court decision had been awaited eagerly by international art circles as a precedent for the recovery of looted artifacts worldwide. `` On the basis of this decision we shall now proceed to demand the return of numerous other ecclesiastical treasures looted from churches and monasteries in the Turkish-occupied region,'' <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been unofficially partitioned since a Turkish invasion in 1974. The breakaway state established in north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1985, which is only recognized by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, argued unsuccessfully in the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> court that the mosaics should be returned to it.

While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced guarded optimism, his chief spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said, `` We are always skeptical of what we hear'' from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that while no efforts had been made by the president or other top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to deal with Iranian officials directly, information was being exchanged with that country's leaders on the situation through third-country intermediaries. Meanwhile, the president and his aides sought to play down talk of a possible military strike against targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage were killed. `` If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the last place I'd be talking about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, speaking with reporters during a picture-taking session in the Oval Office. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, meanwhile, denied that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had selected specific targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for an air strike if kidnappers had carried out a threat to kill American hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. `` I will say he did not make final decisions,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, referring to a story in Friday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was prepared to order the Sixth Fleet to launch air strikes against suspected terrorist strongholds, including a base in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It does not help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be discussing military tactics ... to be flexing our muscles in public,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We do not believe it's in the best interests of releasing the hostages.'' A day after <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s captors said they had spared him, at least for the present, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` certainly pleased that that brutal murder that had been threatened had been set aside.'' On <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s offer to help, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` When you see a statement that offers hope for the return of our hostages, I want to explore it to the fullest.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is thought to have strong influence over Shiite Moslem militants holding Americans captive. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued: `` I'm encouraged. But I do n't want to get the hopes of the hostages' loved ones up once again, to have those hopes dashed. This is a brutal process, where you see people paraded before cameras and their families get their hopes up.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the head of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cornelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommaruga </PERSON>, to voice support for that humanitarian agency's efforts to win freedom for the hostages, according to <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- wanted him to know we appreciated their efforts. We hope they're successful,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is willing to be of any help we can.'' Efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> were alluded to in <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s statement, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would stand firmly behind its vow not to negotiate for the release of hostages. `` We have our policy and that's what we follow,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> made his comments during a prayer sermon at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, broadcast on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. While warning against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` bullyings, arrogant speeches and tyranny,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said: `` Come, let us approach the problem reasonably.'' `` I tell the White House, the problem of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has solutions; the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudent solutions.'' However, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s offer appeared conditional. He urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to take the initiative by pressuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to release the Shiite Moslem cleric it abducted a week ago, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. The kidnapping triggered the apparent execution of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and the death threat against <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. Although officials have said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not seek to dictate hostage policy to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday reiterated an appeal he first made Monday night for all countries holding hostages to release them. `` I would just appeal to the civilized world or any country anywhere in the world to lay aside this holding of people against their will _ hostages _ and do what is right and decent and honorable in terms of the release of those hostages that are still held,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who White House aides said had called more than a dozen world leaders over the past few days in an effort to bring pressure on the kidnappers, cited a `` very extraordinarily broad exercise of diplomacy here in the last couple of days.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> later said diplomatic contacts were continuing. `` There are still a lot of people talking to a lot of people in the region about how to get the hostages out,'' he said. He also said that `` we've had high level and continuing talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' even though the president himself has n't talked directly with Israeli leaders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> deserved the full backing of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in view of the fact that he ignored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warnings to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` That does n't mean we wash our hands of it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He's an American and he is entitled to the concern of the president, and every one of these senators and everybody in our administration And he's got a great, big, wonderful family up there that are eating their hearts out in <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had not talked with members of the <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> family but `` the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been in daily contact with them _ daily.''

 A group of adoptees, birth mothers and adoptive parents wound up a 250-mile march from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the nation's capital Friday pressing for the unsealing of confidential birth records. But the president of another adoption group disagreed with their point, saying, `` People have a right to privacy.'' Forty members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adoption </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ended the 2 -LCB- - week trek by rallying in front of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> while five members went inside to request original birth The three birth mothers and two adoptees were turned down _ as other members of the group had been in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> _ after they spoke to D.C. Registrar <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, an adoptive father himself, explained, `` I have the old nothing answer, I guess, because it's the law. The law says that when a person is adopted ... we create a new birth certificate and the old certificate is under seal and can only be opened by order of the court.'' Birth mothers told of the pain of giving up their infants and then struggling to find them years later. `` It's understood that you're giving him up to people who are so much better, and you do n't have any rights at all,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 39, of suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Adopted children spoke of their frustrations in trying to trace their blood roots while being denied access to original birth records, including medical histories. `` I've just been diagnosed as hypoglycemic,'' said <PERSON> Jannine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, `` and I want to know, does diabetes run in my family?'' But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adoption </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 141 adoption agencies and 2,000 individuals, said in a telephone interview, `` The courts have said rather clearly that ... a person's right to privacy is greater than the right to the information.'' Adoption <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said, `` If a birth mother does n't want to be found, all she has to say is, ` I do n't want a relationship''' when her child contacts her. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he favored a `` middle-of-the-road compromise.'' `` There should be a sensitive legal way for adults to be able to get together if they both want to,'' he said, describing a mutual consent arrangement in 22 states that allows birth mothers and their adult children to meet if both register to express such a desire. Ten states have a system that allows adult adoptees to request a search for their mothers, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. If she is located, the woman can decide whether she wants to meet the child. Three states _ <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> _ open records once an adoptee reaches age 18, and the remainder of the states have sealed records, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A city alderman who left behind his wallet and his <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> to spend five days on the streets said he's gained a new perspective on what it's like to be homeless `` It was a good experience for me,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooden </PERSON>, 39, said on his return Thursday to his job as senior spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the giant hospital company. `` I learned a lot.'' Wooden began his adventure Saturday, when he set off with a quarter in his pocket and a change of socks and underwear in a gym bag. Calling himself <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, he told people he was passing through town, out of work and looking for a job and a place to sleep. After a night on a bench at a downtown plaza, Wooden found his way to a shelter _ and began to enjoy himself, he said. He was `` adopted'' by a man named <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who, along with <PERSON> Wooden </PERSON>, was staying at the Wayside Christian Mission downtown. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> showed Wooden how to panhandle. The alderman said he did n't feel very comfortable asking people for spare change; most ignored him or mumbled that they did n't have change. <PERSON> Wooden </PERSON> said that by Wednesday he fit in with the men at the shelter. That afternoon, a group of them sat on a corner, laughing. The other men were drinking, and Wooden smoked cigars he bought after selling his blood for $ 15. `` We had the best time,'' he said. `` I like to meet people. So I found that part of this adventure fun and exciting. `` They've all got serious problems,'' <PERSON> Wooden </PERSON> said. `` But they're making the best of a bad situation, and some of them are managing to have fun and laugh and joke. Wooden had planned to stay on the streets a week, but said that by Wednesday he'd done what he set out to do: `` meeting some of the people, knowing what kind of services were available and really living the life.'' The alderman said he might not have time to introduce ordinances or otherwise help the homeless during the six months left in his term, but plans to ask workers in missions and shelters what the Board of Aldermen can do for <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>'s estimated 1,200 homeless. He said he might volunteer his own time. <PERSON> Wooden </PERSON> said that as he drove to work Thursday, he spotted some of the men he'd gotten to know at the shelter. `` For the first time, I can see them as real human beings with feelings and families,'' he said.

 Seven people were indicted Friday on money laundering charges stemming from a nationwide <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> investigation that has already netted 19 convictions, including that of former Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The seven men are charged with laundering money they were told was the profit of a south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> drug trafficker. The cash actually was supplied by an undercover <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent, according to the indictment. The money laundering investigation has been under way since 1987 and has so far resulted in 19 convictions in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Former Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanrahan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., has pleaded guilty to violating currency laws, and last month <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was convicted of 10 counts of lying to a grand jury about his involvement in the scheme The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> sting also has nabbed attorneys, bankers and a former <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> aide. According to Friday's indictment, the seven <LOCATION> Massachussets </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> men tried to circumvent federal laws that require banks to report cash transactions of more than $ 10,000, dividing up money into smaller sums, exchanging cash for checks, which they swapped amongst themselves, and buying insurance annuitites under fake names. Charges against them include conspiracy to defraud the government of over $ 1 million, lying to the government and filing false currency reports. Indicted were: <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFrance </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Stoneham </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFrance </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Acton </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maroun </PERSON> 57, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackinnon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, Sr., 65, of <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sottile </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Simsbury </LOCATION>, Ct. Two <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> businesses were also charged, <ORGANIZATION> Maroun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a food distributor in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> FDM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, doing business as <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON>'s restaurant in <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> Reached at his business Friday, <PERSON> Maroun </PERSON> said the indictments came as a total surprise. He said he did not know any of the other defendants and had never met <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, an informant who has figured in several of the cases. `` This is sort of a very odd situation,'' he said, referring other questions to his attorney. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFrance </PERSON> said federal investigators had asked to examine his books about a year and a half ago. `` They did n't really ask anything, they just took the records and left,'' he said. The other defendants could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> and O ` <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> were not listed in the telephone directory. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFrance </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mackinnon </PERSON> did not return telephone calls to their homes, and calls to <PERSON> Sottile </PERSON>'s home went unanswered. Prosecutor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a special attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFrance </PERSON> was arrested, but has not yet entered a plea. The others face arraignment next week, he said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the investigation in each city has relied on the same undercover <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a front man for drug dealers, and the same confidential informant. An admitted con man convicted of money laundering, LeChasney, testified in June against <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and also figured in the case against <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> banker. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> advised <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hanrahan </PERSON> on how to set up bank accounts to shield money laundering activities. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> pleaded guilty and is to be sentenced Sept. 20. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> would not comment on whether any of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> men also had dealings with LeChasney. The indictment alleges that the defendants received commissions of 6 percent to 8 percent on the money they laundered, and filtered the money through more than a dozen <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> banks.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shrimpers could abandon turtle excluder devices in favor of limited trawls to keep endangered sea turtles from drowning in their nets under proposed temporary <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulations completed Friday and scheduled to take effect Tuesday. Department spokesman <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatright </PERSON> said Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> finished the proposal Friday and would submit the plan limiting trawl times to 105 minutes to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> on Monday. In a court hearing Thursday, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> until Monday to draft a plan to protect endangered sea turtles from becoming entangled in shrimpers' nets. Environmentalists, however, said Friday that the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ridley sea turtle faces quick extinction if the government abandons turtle excluder devices in favor of limited shrimp-fishing trawl times. The Center for Marine Conservation and other organizations want <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> to require shrimpers to use turtle excluder devices. Shrimpers, however, say the devices reduce their catch and threaten their livelihood. The center's <PERSON> Marydele </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said limited trawl times `` condemn the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ridley sea turtle to extinction within this century.'' `` A major confrontation looms ahead on sea turtle protection,'' Ms. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said. `` Secretary <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> needs to move swiftly to enforce federal environmental laws protecting endangered species. Restricted tow times, unlike TEDs, will hasten the day when sea turtles will no longer exist in American waters.'' <PERSON> Uhder </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s proposal, shrimpers would have about 7 -LCB- minutes to get their nets in, and 7 -LCB- minutes to get them out, with actual trawl time limited to 90 minutes, <PERSON> Boatright </PERSON> said. While the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contends that sea turtles can survive submerged for 90 minutes, conservationists argue limited trawl times are ineffective in reducing turtle mortality and can not be enforced. The center said the government's most recent analysis found that one in four sea turtles will drown during a tow time of 105 minutes. It said gulf shrimpers normally leave their nets in the water for two to 10 hours. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> suspended enforcement of the turtle excluder device regulations July 24 after shrimpers protested the law.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Friday he was forming a seven-member commission to investigate air terrorism, with particular emphasis on the bombing last December of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an executive order, said the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrorism </ORGANIZATION> would study the adequacy of security procedures. `` The commission also shall review options for handling terrorist acts involving aviation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s order said.

The move was applauded by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who had worked with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in forming the panel `` Every American has grieved afor the victims of Flight 103 and shared the grief of their families. Although the headlines of the tragedy have faded, questions still linger,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` They involve basic factual questions such as what kind of aviation security measures may be necessary under what conditions? What kind of warnings should be given to the traveling public? Where, exactly, responsibility should lie between airports, airlines, the federal government and foreign governmetns in seeking to protect the security of Americans traveling abroad,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s statement said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s move `` a good initiative.'' Flight 103, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 exploded above <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, when a bomb went off on Dec. 21, killing 270 people.

 Reporters bowed in respect as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> broke with imperial tradition Friday and held the throne's first televised news conference since 1975 <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, seated beside Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, began the news conference by expressing gratitude to 10,000 people who attended the state funeral and the hundreds of thousands who lined the streets after his father, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, died in January at 87. `` What I felt while I was in personal contact with Emperor <PERSON> Showa </PERSON> gives me, I think, an important guideline in what an emperor should be,'' said <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s posthumous name. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s 62-year reign _ the longest in Japanese history _ covered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s disastrous war in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and its subsequent rise to an economic superpower. Because of the constitution's strict ban on his exercising political powers, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> could not comment on the crisis facing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s governing conservatives, plagued by money and sex scandals. He said he would be willing to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ two victims of Japanese aggression _ if the government decided it was appropriate. He said the same for <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s southernmost prefecture, where many people remain bitter about the casualties and destruction they bore in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assault. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> never visited <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> after the war. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> said the Daijo-sai, an elaborate ascension rite with strong Shinto significance, should be carried out in accordance with the law. Many critics already argue that by its very nature it violates the constitution's ban of state involvement in religious affairs. In that mystical ceremony to be held next year, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> is to have his first communion with the gods and then be reborn divine. Media reports have estimated it could cost as much as $ 70 million. The government is studying how to conduct the rite. Reporters representing 43 Japanese and 12 foreign news organizations attended the news conference. Journalists were given a detailed explanation of when to rise and bow, and who would sit where in the palace's <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, a large hall with Japanese sliding paper doors and Western-style red carpeting. Sitting behind a low table draped with gold brocade cloth embroidered with chrysanthemums, the imperial symbol, the royal couple spoke slowly and distinctly. At times the empress, wearing a light green dress, spoke so softly her voice was drowned out by the clicking of cameras. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> also spoke in polite but common Japanese, unlike his father, who often used archaic or stilted words no longer understood by the general public. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> repeatedly stressed that his proper role is to uphold <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar constitution, which limits his role to that of a `` symbolic'' figurehead. Four of the 12 main questions, all submitted weeks in advance and subject to government approval, were about <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. Along with the main questions, several follow-ups were allowed, but by pre-decided Japanese questioners. One Imperial Household Agency official requested the scheduled time limit of 30 minutes be carefully observed, because traffic restrictions had been set for streets on the imperial couple's way home. The conference lasted 37 minutes. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> is the first emperor to ascend the throne under the postwar constitution, which limits his role to mostly ceremonial tasks. The previous constitution gave <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> nominal powers, and the wartime government asserted it was acting in his name. The constitution also omits all references to the emperor's special relationship with the gods of Shinto, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s indigenous religion, which angers some conservatives <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s monarchy can trace its history to at least the 8th century, and by legend until the 6th century B.C. and Emperor <PERSON> Jimmu </PERSON>, who is said to have descended from the sun goddess, <ORGANIZATION> Amaterasu </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, rarely changing her expression of polite concentration, said that because of her husband's heavy responsibilities she must `` make the home a place where he can ... find peace and relaxation with his family.'' The royal couple split with the past by raising their two sons and daughter by themselves. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> was raised by chamberlains from age 3. Their eldest son, Crown Prince <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON>, 29, is now seeking a bride, and when asked about his growing independence, <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> said, `` It would make me happy if he would come, even if only from time to time, to play the viola for us.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> oil company signed an agreement with the government Friday to explore and possibly develop deposits as part of an investment that could total several hundred million dollars. The initial investment calls for $ 25 million over five years to search for oil in fields located near <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s hot, dry northern border with <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. The company also reportedly wants to buy about 250 gas stations. Company vice president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> eventually might invest `` hundreds of millions of dollars'' in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> helped develop <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s reserves after oil was discovered accidentally in southern <LOCATION> Chubut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> in 1907.

<HEAD>At British Auction, American Civil War Newspapers Hottest Sellers</HEAD>

 American newspapers that recorded events from the Civil War were the hottest sellers Friday at an auction of old newspapers, the auctioneers <PERSON> Bonhams </PERSON> said. The newspapers were sold by an anonymous English collector who said his family was `` being driven bananas by all my newspapers all over the house,'' but that he was so avid he was keeping newspapers mentioning the auction. About 300 newspapers were sold for a total of about $ 5,000, said auctioneer <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilcott </PERSON>. `` The trend from the sale would suggest that there's a great market for 17th century and 18th century newspapers and an even better market for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspapers,'' <PERSON> Chilcott </PERSON> said. `` American newspapers describing the Civil War, they were most eagerly sought after, they were the ones we had the most competition for from the bidders,'' he said. The oldest newspaper in the sale, The Perfect Diurnall, of Aug. 28, 1648, fetched the highest price, about $ 246. The newspaper, which reported <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>'s new model army capturing the town of <LOCATION> Colchester </LOCATION>, was produced by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and was principally a record of parliamentary debates. The older newspapers were generally in better condition because the quality of modern paper is such that a newspaper exposed to light can turn yellow within a week. The most modern newspapers for sale _ recording the Falklands War and the wedding of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> _ did n't sell, <PERSON> Chilcott </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> signed an accord with opposition leaders Friday urging that the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels be disbanded, and he said he would press for the breakup at a summit of Central American leaders. `` I hope the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will respect this sovereign decision of the Nicaraguan people and change <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and that it puts an end to the -LRB- 1985 -RRB- economic embargo,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said before leaving for the weekend conference in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the rebels to stay organized until after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> holds general elections next year. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> talked to reporters shortly after he signed the agreement, worked out during 22 hours of talks between the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government and leaders from 20 opposition parties. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the rebels support the same principles that were laid out in Friday's agreement, adding: `` We are not opposed to the question of reintegrating ourselves into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under democratic conditions But those conditions have to be negotiated.'' In the accord, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> pledge to hold free and fair elections Feb. 25, without any restraints on campaigning or news censorship. They promise to suspend the military draft from September until after the balloting to prevent it from interfering with electoral activity. The Sandinistas initiated the negotiations to defuse complaints by opposition leaders that their candidates were harassed in earlier elections, their movements constrained and their exposure to the public restricted by news censorship. The presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> will join <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a member of the rebel political directorate, already has expressed his determination to keep the Contras operating. Opposition leaders told reporters they were generally satisfied with Friday's agreement, even though it was not all they wanted. `` No country, however powerful, has the right to interfere in the Nicaraguan electoral process,'' <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said, speaking for a coalition of 14 of the 20 parties. `` Even though the opposition is not completely satisfied, the electoral process is being channeled toward what the opposition wants. The accord reflects the common will to contribute toward the peace process at the summit.'' The Tela summit Saturday and Sunday will be the fifth held under a peace plan that President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> drafted in August 1987 to negotiate an end to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s civil war and leftist insurrections in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The focus will be on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the 12,000 Contras, now living with their dependents in base camps in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided the Contras with military aid until a year ago. It now sends them only non-lethal aid such as clothing and food. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> says the Contras are an economic burden and that he wants them out of his country. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he hoped `` the Honduran government feels stronger now to push for the demobilization of the Contras in Honduran territory.'' Friday's accord also calls for undercover activities to halt during <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s electoral process. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also promise to grant unconditional amnesty to all political prisoners, a move that will benefit 1,605 rebels in Nicaraguan jails. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began supporting the Contras in 1982 and declared an economic embargo on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> three years later, arguing that Sandinista efforts to impose a leftist government and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' close military ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> threatened security in Central America. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supports the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> peace plan but says the Contras should not be disbanded until after the elections. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, visited <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> this week to press that point. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, briefing reporters on the <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> trip on condition of anonymity, cited complaints that the Sandinista government is mounting raids on suspected Contra sympathizers in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and failed to create fair conditions for political opponents. The Contras' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said he was `` elated that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has come out unequivocally in favor of having the resistance remain as a viable force.'' He said the process of democratization in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> remain only promises by the Sandinista government, adding, `` You do not take down the scaffold before the building is finished.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> on Friday that 120 of his appointments are languishing in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as lawmakers prepare to begin a long summer recess. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he told the president he was n't dragging his feet, that some delays had been requested by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators and that he would be as prompt as possible. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also said he turned down a request by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for an immediate vote by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on the president's nomination of <PERSON> Willliam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Civil Rights Division. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination was rejected last week by a 7-7 vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The president asked me to bring the nomination to the floor today for a vote. I refused his request, pointing out this is the last day of the session and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was working hard to complete action on the savings and loan bill and extension of the debt limit _ both urgently requested by the president himself,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said in a statement after a private meeting with the president. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also indicated he warned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a letter not to seek to re-appoint <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> during the upcoming recess. Such `` recess appointments,'' which expire at the end of the next <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> session, are sometimes used as a method of temporarily bypassing the confirmation process. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president was concerned about the delay in his nominations. `` The president wanted to register his deep concern that these were being held up for artificial reasons not related to the candidates themselves,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that 186 of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominations had been approved with `` several more'' scheduled to be confirmed soon. `` Several of those delayed were at the request of Republican senators,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` I assured the president we would continue to move on his nominations as promptly as possible consistent with careful review of their qualifications.'' The White House and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have been wrangling for weeks over the backlog of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominations not yet acted on by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. White House officials and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., have claimed that many of the nominations are being held up for purely political purposes Among those nominations caught in the logjam is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, who had been his national security adviser when he was vice president, as ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s nomination, politically controverisal because of <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s alleged familiarity with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Iran-Contra dealings, was approved by committee, but has yet to receive a floor vote Also on hold is a batch of nominations to top-level positions in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The agency is the target of influence-peddling inquiries. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> claimed thta some of the nominations were being held hostage to legislation sought by individual members, while `` in some cases they -LRB- senators -RRB- want commitments on their own candidates for other jobs.'' `` Some cases, it appeared to be just political,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. The White House and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are also feuding over whether <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff aides should be allowed to study confidential <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominees. The White House now only permits senators to review this material. `` We feel very strongly that the privacy of individual nominees is such that members of the staff should not be able to rummage trough people's private backgrounds and resumes and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files and we register a very strong protest against that idea,'' the spokesman said. `` He feels very strongly that senators are elected to make these kinds of judgments,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

 The chairman and directors of <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which controls <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, have been accused in a civil lawsuit of making illegal stock transactions to ward off possible takeover bids. <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it had not yet reviewed the complaint, but `` there was no basis whatsover for claims'' contained in a news release which announced the filing of the lawsuit. The accusations were made Thursday in a lawsuit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Avacus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 7.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> stock and indicated in March it might launch a takeover bid. <PERSON> Avacus </PERSON> said Chairman <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> engineered stock transactions involving <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> and two other companies it controls in an effort to frustrate takeover interest in <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> and entrench current management. It said <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> received inadequate consideration in the deals, and that the transactions enabled <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> and his allies to boost their interest in the company to 32 percent from 13 percent. In addition to <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, the lawsuit named <PERSON> Infotechnologies </PERSON>' four other directors as defendants. The lawsuit asked that the court rescind the stock transactions in question and place <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> under control of a receiver. `` Infotech is confident that the lawsuit is entirely without merit,'' Friday's statement read. The lawsuit stated that <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> agreed in late February to issue 1.5 million shares of its common stock valued at $ 16.15 million in exchange for the stock of <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held company set up and managed by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>. WNW's main assets are the right to control <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> wire service, which has not been profitable in the last decade and continues to report losses since emerging from bankruptcy law protection in 1986. <PERSON> Avacus </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> had obtained those assets for WNW a year earlier for $ 110,000, and noted that <ORGANIZATION> Infotechnology </ORGANIZATION> paid 150 times the price he paid the previous year.

 An alleged cocaine dealer and two former bodyguards to Hustler publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> pleaded innocent Friday to the murder of theatrical producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> in a dispute over `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' movie. The prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty against one or more of the defendants at their upcoming trial. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLayne </PERSON> `` Lanie'' <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, who is accused of ordering <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s killing in 1983, answered, `` Not guilty,'' in a soft voice and said she denied special circumstance allegations that the killing was for financial gain and committed during a kidnapping. Co-defendants <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMota </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> pleaded innocent in the <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> murder as well. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> said outside court: `` I can say we will be seeking the death penalty on one or more defendants. As to which defendants has not been determined at this time.'' <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, an obese, cocaine sniffing producer who was collaborating with <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> movie mogul <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> on finances for `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' disappeared on May 13, 1983. He was last seen stepping into a limousine with Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> en route to a swank <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> restaurant for a meeting. The case lay dormant nearly six years until <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s brother-in-law and former chief of security, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rider </PERSON>, came forward and gave damaging evidence He linked <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, the former bodyguards, to the slaying and said he was told that <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> paid for `` the hit.'' <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head. His body was found in a dry riverbed 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> where Rider said the Flynt bodyguards often held target practice. Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, a reputed cocaine dealer who was once <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' girlfriend, was ordered to stand trial along with <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> after a four-month preliminary hearing which focused on <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s fast life in a drug infested circle of celebrities and shady <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> has alleged that Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> as hit men because she saw <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> as an obstacle to her share of a lucrative deal with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> for money from `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> refused to testify at the preliminary hearing on Fifth Amendment grounds, but his lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> murder. <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> also pleaded innocent to charges in a second murder of a prostitute, June Mincher, which is unrelated to the <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> case. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Klausner </PERSON> ordered the defendants to return to his court Aug. 11 for assignment to a trial judge. The three, who are being held without bail, waived their right to a speedy trial until 60 days after that hearing at which <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> said he would announce which defendants will be the subject of his efforts to gain death sentences.

<HEAD>Cuban Government Releases Evidence in Drug Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has released its first report of the evidence against high-ranking military officials who were executed or imprisoned for dealing in drugs, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government news agency said Friday. In a dispatch from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> agency said the evidence was published in a 480-page book called `` Case 1-89, the End of the Cuban Connection.'' It did not describe the contents. Although parts of the trials and appeals were televised, the evidence was kept secret. `` Case 1-89'' includes court records and other materials from the military trials that resulted in four executions and the imprisonment of 10 officers, the report said. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s government publishing company said the book was intended to counter what it described as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> disinformation campaign linking the prosecutions to an alleged crackdown on political dissidents, <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Sautie </PERSON>, head of the publishing company, as saying: `` The revelations were made so that the foreign reader can interpret the facts with precise information about the legal procedures followed in the military trial.'' The scandal embarrassed President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who had said for years that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations of drug trafficking by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials were propaganda. Four officers, including a highly decorated general, were executed for their roles in the ring, which the government said also dealt in diamonds, furs, rare woods and other contraband. Several officials, including the interior minister, were dismissed for failing to detect or prevent the smuggling.

 A man identified by authorities as the `` supreme boss'' of the Naples-based Camorra crime organization has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, federal police announced Friday. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Veronezzi </PERSON>, the head of federal police in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, told reporters that <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Toscanino </PERSON> `` coordinated, from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Camorra </ORGANIZATION>'s distribution of cocaine and heroin to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The Camorra in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, is similar to the Mafia elsewhere. <PERSON> Veronezzi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Toscanino </PERSON>, 54, has been in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> since 1986 and directed a drug smuggling network with branches in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Working with information supplied by Italian authorities, federal police determined that <PERSON> Toscanino </PERSON> had a luxurious house in the city of <LOCATION> Jundiai </LOCATION>, 37 miles north of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Veronezzi </PERSON>. He said that in a search of the house police confiscated $ 41,000 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency and Italian bank certificates worth the equivalent of $ 350,000. On July 19, three <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> police agents arrived with documents and photographs `` for the positive identification of Toscanino'' and the suspect was arrested Wednesday at his seaside residence in <LOCATION> Guaruja </LOCATION>, 47 miles south of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Veronezzi </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Toscanino </PERSON> claimed he was a real estate broker and denied any knowledge of the Camorra. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has requested <PERSON> Toscanino </PERSON>'s extradition but if convicted in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> he might have to serve up to 10 years in prison before he could be sent back to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Toscanino </PERSON> has been charged here with illegal entry and the use of false documents along with drug trafficking.

<HEAD>Rebels Kill Guard On Peruvian Train; Mother Teresa Asks For Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seven gunmen believed to be Shining Path guerrillas mingled with passengers boarding a train and killed a police guard after the train was under way, authorities said Friday. The attack occurred on Thursday, 155 miles east of the capital city of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> on the rail line that connects <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> with the Andean city of <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION>, according to the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cronica </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1980, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has been bled by the leftist insurgency of the Mao-inspired Shining Path. The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the fighting. Nobel laureate <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, who is in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> attending a religious conference on poverty and violence, pleaded with people to forgive and pray for those who take up arms `` that they realize their profound error and the injury they cause others.'' `` Begin with forgiveness, because when you forgive there is peace, love and happiness,'' she told reporters at a news conference Thursday. The report on the train attack said the seven rebels boarded the train in <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION>, concealing their weapons and mixing with the passengers. When the train entered a tunnel 15 miles from <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, the seven went to the first car of the train and shot the guard, identified as <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Serpa </PERSON>, sergeant in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s security police force. They then went to the locomotive and forced the engineer to stop the train. They tied up the engineer and fled into the countryside, the report said. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s Central Railroad line is the world's highest normal gauge railroad, rising to more than 13,000 feet from <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> on the coast. It is a popular scenic route with tourists. It also is an important link between <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and the rich farming and mining areas of the sierra. The Shining Path frequently targets the line as part of its strategy to cut the capital off from the rest of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Two weeks ago the rebels dynamited the tracks under a train carrying copper ore, derailing all 18 cars. The Shining Path began its insurgency near <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The violence has spread through most of the Andean highlands, parts of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastline and into the coca-producing jungles of the northeast.

<HEAD>Girls With Rare Blood Disease Lose Chance For Operation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twin girls suffering from a rare blood disease lost a chance at the transplants they desperately need when their insurance company went bankrupt, and their family is struggling to raise money for the surgery. If the $ 60,000 needed for bone marrow transplants ca n't be raised in a few weeks, 5-year-old <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> will be hooked up to transfusion needles eight hours a day, five days a week, said their uncle, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON>. `` These kids have gone through so much already,'' <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON> said Friday. The girls, who suffer from congenital anemia and can not produce enough red blood cells, have already undergone 72 transfusions, which are causing spleen and liver damage. The twins' older brother and sister have tissues that match perfectly with their sisters', and an operation was set for July 5 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. But on July 3, the family's insurance company, <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, went bankrupt. The hospital would not admit the twins without insurance. `` They urgently need to have something done,'' said the twins' doctor, who asked that her name not be used The girls' father, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, had lost his job as a meat cutter, and was working two jobs _ delivering newspapers and hauling trash _ to pay insurance premiums. `` Last winter he went into the country and chopped wood to save money on heating bills,'' <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON> said. `` Basically, he's been working 16-hour days for five years. In all that time, I do n't think he's taken more than five days off. After Amalgamated Labor Life went bankrupt, the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it would provide up to $ 100,000 for each girl's operation. The medical center said it would admit the girls and begin the operation, but only if it was guaranteed payment of $ 130,000 per child. The insurance money is available only through September, meaning the family will have to raise the $ 60,000 and have the transplants performed before the end of next month. The family has raised about $ 23,000 by Thursday, <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON> said. `` The real time pressure is that we need to get the girls in the hospital immediately,'' he said. `` If the transplants are successful, then the girls will be able to manufacture their own red blood cells, and they should have a healthy, normal life ahead of them.'' The cost of the transplants will go far beyond $ 130,000 per child, <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> said the other day that he knows he is financially ruined no matter what happens,'' <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON> said. `` He told me, ` I'm done for the rest of my life. It would be like paying for a car or a house as long as you live. But it would be worth it.'''

 Soviet and Hungarian draftees plan to set up a trade union within the military and asked the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conscript </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for guidance, the founder of the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> union, <ORGANIZATION> Loebas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oosterbeek </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Oosterbeek </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet and Hungarian delegations met with his union on the fringes of last week's <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conscript </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, which they were attending for the first time. Founded in 1966, the Dutch group is the oldest of its kind in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It won Dutch soldiers the right to wear long hair, go home after hours and work a 38-hour week. According to <ORGANIZATION> Oosterbeek </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc delegates asked Dutch union officials dozens of questions about how they ran their organization, which he said has served as an example for several draftees' groups in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The delegates plans were afoot to set up similar unions of their own in line with the political and economic reforms initiated by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Oosterbeek </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet delegation at <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> consisted of a 19-year-old conscripted army sergeant; a 21-year-old cadet of the <ORGANIZATION> Frunze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and an official of the state-controlled Committee for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> who <PERSON> Osterbeek </PERSON> said was sent along as a security agent. Two army privates represented <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Osterbeek </PERSON> quoted them as saying that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will form a conscript organization within a year. There was no immediate word whether the new draftees' unions would have official status. According to the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s armed forces amount to 5.1 million soldiers on active duty and 6.2 million reservists, but there are no estimates on how many of those are conscripts serving a two-year stint.

 The main opposition party and a human rights group called Friday for the justice minister to resign because of the deaths of two leftist prison inmates on a hunger strike. <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Cevdet </PERSON> <PERSON> Selvi </PERSON> said Justice Minister <PERSON> Oltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sungurlu </PERSON> was responsible for the deaths of the two inmates, who had been on a hunger strike for 35 days. The inmates died Wednesday after they were transfered along with 310 other prisoners from <LOCATION> Eskisehir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> to a prison in <LOCATION> Aydin </LOCATION>, about 300 miles to the west. Prosecutors said the inmates, <PERSON> Mehmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Yalcinkaya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Huseyin </PERSON> <PERSON> Husnu </PERSON> <PERSON> Eroglu </PERSON>, died of dehydration. The inmates were among 280 prisoners who began a hunger strike at <LOCATION> Eskisehir </LOCATION> prison June 28 to protest restrictions imposed by authorities following the discovery of an escape attempt. The hunger strikers claimed they were not fed sufficient meals and were not allowed to go outside for air. <PERSON> Sungurlu </PERSON> told reporters Friday that the `` hunger strike was a political action and the fasting prisoners refused any kind of medical help.'' The independent <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <PERSON> Sungurlu </PERSON> should resign and should also face prosecution for what it called his `` irresponsible attitude toward the problem.'' Authorities said the transfer of prisoners from <LOCATION> Eskisehir </LOCATION> was necessary so that workers could repair the damage to the prison caused by the digging of two escape tunnels. <PERSON> Yalcinkaya </PERSON>, 28, had been sentenced to death for being a member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eroglu </PERSON>, 31, was on trial on charges of being a member of the same party. A wave of political terrorism, pitting members of a dozen military leftist groups against extreme rightists, claimed 5,000 lives in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> prior to the military takeover at the end of last decade. According to statistics complied by the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 1,542 terrorist suspects are still in prison and still on trial and 1,357 are serving sentences.

<TEXT>
 Mystery fans expecting to help solve a mock murder at a seacoast restaurant this weekend now have to untangle a real crime: who took the money that was supposed to pay for the weekend fun. A woman posing as the organizer of the mystery weekend put out a brochure advertising the fake murder and got people to pay up to $ 500 for rooms, meals and the staged mystery, the attorney general's office says. Luka's Greenhouse Restaurant in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> never scheduled the event because the woman failed to make a down payment on a room, said Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. He is urging people who paid for the weekend to notify his office. Mock murders are a relatively recent phenomenon. People pay hundreds of dollars to take a cruise, stay at a hotel or ride a train where a fake crime takes place. They are given certain clues by the mystery organizers and then have to solve the puzzle, usually a murder, using only the clues and their ingenuity. The management at <LOCATION> Luka </LOCATION>'s is trying to come up with some clues to the whereabouts of `` <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>,'' who told the restaurant she wanted to rent a room for a murder mystery. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster-Hill </PERSON>, functions sales manager at <LOCATION> Luka </LOCATION>'s, said she talked to the woman several times. The woman never gave her last name, <PERSON> Foster-Hill </PERSON> said, but left a telephone number for a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, residence. She said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> was told she would have to send in a deposit before the room could be reserved for her, and she never did. `` I called her a few times and told her we had to have the money before we could give her a room,'' <PERSON> Foster-Hill </PERSON> said. `` She kept saying she would n't send any money until we sent her a menu so she could see our food selection. We sent her at least four menus but never got any money.'' <PERSON> Foster-Hill </PERSON> said the last time she called the Beverly number, about three weeks ago, the line was disconnected. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feith </PERSON> said he has talked to three people, all from out of state, who mailed checks to a post office box in <LOCATION> Plaistow </LOCATION> and received confirmation letters for the mystery weekend. <PERSON> Feith </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Plaistow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has told him no one has been checking the box lately and that, when it was opened by authorities, it was empty. <PERSON> Feith </PERSON> said the people he has spoken with do n't seem to realize that the mystery weekend is off and wo n't be held at a later date. `` Our fear is that <LOCATION> Luka </LOCATION>'s will be visited by a number of people this weekend expecting to see some kind of show,'' <PERSON> Feith </PERSON> said. `` We expect to be pretty busy with calls from the people on Monday or Tuesday.'' <PERSON> Foster-Hill </PERSON> said a man called <LOCATION> Luka </LOCATION>'s last week to find out where he was staying for the weekend and was told there would be no mock murder. `` He was n't too happy,'' <PERSON> Foster-Hill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Foster-Hill </PERSON> also said she was contacted recently by a hotel in <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, that had paid $ 600 to advertise in <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s mystery brochure

 A judge refused Friday to let state police exhume a teen-age boy's body in their search for the source of six toes found preserved in the home of a man apparently obsessed with feet. `` So many people would like to know what happened,'' said <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudock </PERSON>. State police found two big toes, two middle toes and two little toes in a glass jar when they searched the mobile home where farm worker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, lived alone outside <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION>, nearly 40 miles north of this western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> county seat, authorities said. Trooper <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> told him he cut one toe from the body of <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, 15, of <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> at a funeral home in the <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION> area. The boy was killed in a 1985 hunting accident, <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> would n't say where he got the other toes, <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Earley </PERSON> at a 45-minute exhumation hearing. <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> said police wanted permission to open the grave to determine whether more than one toe was taken from the boy. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>'s family objected. <PERSON> Earley </PERSON> said the most severe charge police could file against <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> is mutilation of a corpse, a second-degree misdemeanor with a two-year statute of limitations, which has passed. Police said they were led to <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> by a neighbor who told them <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> proposed that the two of them pick up an unidentified 17-year-old girl, have sex with her, kill her and mutilate her body. <PERSON> Hudock </PERSON> said the neighbor introduced <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> to an undercover state trooper posing as a professional killer. <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> said he arrested <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> on July 16, when he joined the undercover officer in a barn where <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> allegedly expected the girl's slaying to occur. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was being held in the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 100,000 bond on charges of conspiracy to commit homicide, criminal solicitation and attempted homicide, <PERSON> Hudock </PERSON> said. Troopers found the toes in a glass jar hidden in a basket of wild nuts, <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner's Office officials said they were unable to determine whether the toes came from the same body. The search of <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s home yielded numerous photographs of people's feet and films of marchers in parades with the camera zooming in on the marchers' legs and feet, <PERSON> Hudock </PERSON> said. Police said they could not tell who took the pictures. One photograph showed an unidentified barefoot boy `` lying in high grass'' with his bare feet above the grass, <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> said. Another showed the bare feet of a `` tall, thin man'' standing in dirt with his shoes on the ground beside him, <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Earley </PERSON> that police wanted to know if any harm came to those in the photographs. Police said they also found 65 memorial cards from <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> county funeral homes. <PERSON> Hudock </PERSON> said he suspected <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> attended dozens of funerals of people he did not know. The prosecutor said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> is not a suspect in any homicide and has no psychiatric history or criminal record.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government ordered schools closed Friday after government plainclothesmen fired on demonstrators at the national university, killing one student and wounding at least six An Education Ministry statement said public and private schools were being closed nationwide `` until further notice ... for the safety of students, to preserve the peace of mind of their families and peace throughout the community in general.'' The order did not affect the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, but it announced earlier it was closing down its campus to protest the Thursday night shootings. University officials in a statement Friday accused <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of acting `` brutally against unarmed students'' and for `` the excessive and indiscriminate use of toxic gases and shotguns. In a veiled reference to foes of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who have been pressing for his ouster, the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement accused `` those who have been advocating violence and confrontations among Panamanians'' of encouraging the students to demonstrate. An estimated 700,000 students were left without classes. About half of them were in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the port of Colon, located across the isthmus at the northern entrance of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said plainclothes members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> fired shotguns at a student protest. Demonstrators were protesting an <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> proposal to end <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political turmoil by holding a plebiscite Aug. 20. The students and opposition parties insist that elections May 7, which their candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won overwhelmingly, should be declared valid. The Noriega-controlled government annulled the elections, claiming fraud. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> runs <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> through his command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which include both soldiers and police. Student leaders said in a news release that <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, `` was not welcome any more'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because of the plebiscite proposal. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> heads an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission of diplomats trying to mediate here.

 President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Friday a reasonable solution existed to the hostage crisis and he was willing to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> find it. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> later reported progress in hostage talks in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I tell the White House the problem of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has solutions, the freeing of the hostages has solutions _ reasonable, prudent solutions,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said in his sermon in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> at weekly Moslem prayers. Official <ORGANIZATION> Algiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that progress was made in talks on Friday in which <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasnawi </PERSON>, was involved. It said <PERSON> Hasnawi </PERSON> met with the spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, and with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> in talks involving all hostages, whether `` Lebanese, Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis.'' `` Progress in this mediation was accomplished Friday,'' the official state radio said, without elaborating. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said she was aware of the report from <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> but added, `` I have nothing specific on that.'' <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, while proud of its role in mediating past crises, including the January 1981 release of American hostages held in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, usually is close-mouthed about its involvement until an issue is settled. The radio report was seen as a sign that Algerian authorities think a deal is close. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Hasnawi </PERSON> for 30 minutes in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and said he sought <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s help in determining the fate of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty in February 1988. His captors said they hanged him Monday in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric. A videotape was released, showing a man on a gallows who appeared to be <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but no body has been found. Some reports said he was killed months ago. In the streets of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the group believed to hold the Western hostages, paraded to denounce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At weekly prayers before the demonstration, <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> urged those holding the hostages not to harm them. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would explore <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s offer `` to the fullest,'' but added: `` I do n't want to raise hopes beyond fulfillment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> expressed willingness to relay to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the demands for a prisoner release made Thursday by the kidnappers of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> when they suspended plans to kill him. A knowledgeable <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> source in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, speaking privately, said the final word on <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s reprieve came from <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who `` must have used his first day in office to pressure the kidnappers to spare <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s life.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who was inaugurated Thursday, is believed eager to improve ties with the West and erase <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s image as a sponsor of international terrorism. In his sermon, he sought a conciliatory tone with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` These bullyings, arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems. Come, let us approach the problem reasonably; we too will help solv the problems there, so the people of the region can live in peace and harmony,'' he said in the sermon, broadcast by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants hostages freed, it must ask <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the statements `` encouraging'' but said the hostage situation was `` a serious problem'' and he did not expect changes in the increased deployment of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sent commandos to southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on July 28 to abduct <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> offered to trade <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and other Shiite prisoners for three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and for the Western hostages. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said about the <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> killing: `` We do not make any judgment about the group that executed the American colonel. You can not condemn the innocent people of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> ... on the vague basis that some group has possibly killed someone -LRB- <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> -RRB- for a crime.'' If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> responds by saying it can not pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into freeing <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, `` this is n't acceptable to us,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. Sixteen Westerners are captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was seized March 16, 1985. In south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said those holding the hostages should not harm them. `` Let's be better than they'' he said of what <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> call `` the arrogant powers.'' `` Let's be loftier. Let's be more humanitarian. What we want is for those detained people not to be hurt.'' The demonstration after his sermon was to protest <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction Men with beards and women in ankle-length black chadors carried banners reading `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the mother of all terrorism.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, one of the kidnapping groups believed to be fronts for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday it was suspending its death sentence against <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> and replacing it with demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> free Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners. It said it would provide a list to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dufour </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegate in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said: `` We've taken notice that our services may be needed, and if a party approaches us to transmit messages, we'll do it.'' <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s Lebanese wife, <PERSON> Elham </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that her heart, `` which was full of despair, sadness and pain for several years, has regained some hope and was refreshed by this encouraging humanitarian initiative.'' In his hometown of <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, the hostage's relatives decorated a sign proclaiming the number of his days in captivity with a dozen balloons and an American flag. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s top leaders conferred about a response to the demands, which <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> said must be accepted `` within days.'' It did not say what would happen to <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused. In addition to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s aid, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> announced Friday it had been in touch with all sides.

 A Christian Science couple were acquitted Friday of involuntary manslaughter but convicted of child endangerment for relying on prayer instead of medical treatment for their dying infant daughter. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rippberger </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, 39, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, Scientist, face up to four years state in prison for the 1984 meningitis death of their 8-month-old daughter <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could make the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s job easier by writing laws clearly, eliminating the need for time-consuming court interpretations, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said in a speech Friday. In the speech prepared for delivery at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s convention, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said fellow Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> has revived the debate over statutory language vs. legislative history. In the past 50 years, courts trying to determine congressional intent have looked at the legislative history of laws as well as the wording of the statutes, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Such history includes committee hearings and reports, floor debates and conference committee actions. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said a nearly 100-year-old high court decision _ Holy <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ which allowed the interpretation of even a clear statute based on legislative history, `` barely'' survived the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s last session. In their interpretations, the courts begin with the statutory language, which if thought clearly to relect legislative intent, is followed, he said. However, `` most statutory cases involve not plain, but ambiguous language, and in these cases resort to legislative history has been the usual course,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` This is often a very large undertaking, taking hours and hours of effort by judges, law clerks, and librarians, to say nothing of the time lawyers spend and charge for seeking to present the materials that the judiciary has indicated are relevant to decision.'' With the ever-increasing complexity of subjects considered by courts, more people, including <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, advocate a return to interpreting statutes based almost wholly on the legislation's text, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said `` The statute as it is written, it is said, is what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted, not statements in hearings, not discussion of statutory terms contained in committee reports, and not statements on the floor,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who was appointed to the court by President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1962. White said <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee, would confine the review of legislative history to cases where the statuatory language itself `` produces an absurdity.'' The debate over how statutes should be interpreted `` is extremely important since it involves how the courts may best carry out the will of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, adding that in some cases <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be vague on purpose, to force court decisions. White mentioned several other areas where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as the major source of changes in federal law, could `` simplify our work and at the same time make its intent known..'' _ When enacting laws, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should include a statute of limitations, he said _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sometimes creates what seems to be a right, but fails to provide a remedy, creating a recurring legal issue over whether the seeming beneficiary of the right has a private remedy in federal court, he said. _ Regarding conflicts between federal and state laws, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should make its intentions clear when it plans to supersede state law. _ White said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should clarify `` obvious uncertainties'' over statutes mandating the payment of lawyers' fees by losing defendants. More than 8,000 lawyers are attending the convention, which continues through Wednesday. The dinner was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate over a routine spending bill was halted temporarily Friday when conservatives tried using it to restore <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s $ 23,000 annual pension, forfeited after his felony convictions in the Iran-Contra affair. The proposal, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, would exempt the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide from a law denying retirement pay to officials convicted of destroying government documents, one of three felonies on which <PERSON> North </PERSON> was found guilty. Democrats, reluctant to force a vote on the controversial former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, instead delayed consideration of the spending bill which would provide $ 18.4 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies for fiscal 1990. Senators returned to the spending bill, passing it by voice vote, only after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders promised <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> that he would be allowed action on a separate bill on North after the summer recess but before Nov. 3. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> complained that the government spent $ 40 million `` not only to prosecute but to persecute'' North. He cited <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where he won a <ORGANIZATION> Bronze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts `` A lot of the pygmies who criticize <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> never saw a day when they were willing to lay down their lives for the country,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., countered that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was not only a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> hero but a convicted felon `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> is no different than any other citizen,'' said <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>. `` If you're found guilty, you have a right to appeal. If you're found guilty, you lose certain benefits.'' The debate eventually pitted a pair of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veterans of the Vietnam War against each other. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., who lost a portion of his leg in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, argued that it is wrong for lawmakers to seek exceptions for otherwise deserving individuals who fail to qualify for government benefits He cited a constituent who lost parts of both legs in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> but who failed to qualify for certain government payments because the amputations were not severe enough. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fighter pilot who was a prisoner of war in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for 5 -LCB- years, countered, `` I'll take up his case The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> suspended <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s pension when he was sentenced on July 5 by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to perform 1,200 hours of community service and pay a $ 150,000 fine. He was given no prison time. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> later reversed itself, arguing that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a retiree, should not be considered an officeholder under the terms of the law. But on Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s argument. North was convicted May 4 on charges of giving false testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the Iran-Contra hearings, accepting a security fence for his home, and shredding classified documents. He is appealing his convictions. The former lieutenant colonel has become a popular dinner speaker, with reports saying he collects up to $ 25,000 for each appearance. Earlier this week, Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, offered another proposal to restore <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s pension. Democrats watered it down to instead require the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to study the question and report by November. On Wednesday, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, introduced a separate bill to restore <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s pension.

 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> said Friday that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy plane nearly collided with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jetliner of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national airline, according to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s official news agency. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Colombian aviation officials said they knew nothing about the purported incident. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported the pilot of the Colombian jet told the aviation agency that on Wednesday he saw a `` silver-blue plane'' flying from east to west at the same altitude as that of <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION>'s Flight 63, the <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> dispatch said. The news agency reported the pilot said that if the other plane had been flying at a greater speed a collision would have been inevitable. The news agency said at the same time that the incident occurred a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> RC-135 spy plane was flying over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> engaged in `` espionage activities.'' It reported the <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> pilot filed complaints with air traffic control authorities in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The dispatch was monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Salac </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said it had not received such a report and if one had been made with the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> control center the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office would have been notified. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, airport officials and the local Avianca office said they had not heard of such a report. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he had checked with several <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> offices about the Cuban account and `` I ca n't find anyone who knows about it.''

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Strippers' Age Discrimination Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state judge on Friday ruled against three French Quarter strippers who are challenging a new city ordinance that bars striptease dancing by those under 21. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Arendt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Josette </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Folks </PERSON> contend that the city is unconstitutionally denying them employment because of their age, and they sought an injunction against enforcing the ordinance. State District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> set an Aug. 9 hearing on the lawsuit. The women, who are over 18 but under 21, said they `` chose their profession or occupation because they enjoy being entertainers and dancing.'' The law went into effect July 26. No arrests had been made as of Friday, an assistant city attorney said. In their lawsuit filed Thursday, the women said the ordinance is `` based on a request and false representations of an entity which is trying to impose its religious views and values on plaintiffs and other citizens of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed the ordinance last month after <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which cares for runaways and the homeless, charged that stripping could lead to prostitution and drug use. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he had to compete with `` drug dealers and flesh peddlers'' in trying to find jobs for young drifters. However, many club operators say the job of striptease dancing gives young people a haven from street life. Deputy City Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he believes the ordinance is on solid legal ground. `` The law says you've got to be 21 to buy an alcoholic drink in a bar,'' he said. `` It just seems inconsistent for -LRB- people under 21 -RRB- to work in that environment when the obvious intent of the -LRB- drinking age law -RRB- is not to have them in that environment in the first place.''

He identified the victims as <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, 8; <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 4; <PERSON> Kadie </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, 8 months. The parents were in stable condition Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Wyandotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbler </PERSON>, assistant director of nursing. The family was from nearby <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The car was traveling at about 45 mph in a 25 mph zone when it went out of control on a road that ended with a barricade at the river, <PERSON> Rothermal </PERSON> said. He said the car smashed through the barricade and hit the water. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Delisle </PERSON> was questioned by police Thursday night, but `` was in shock and incoherent,'' <PERSON> Rothermal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Delisle </PERSON> said the family had left a restaurant with her husband at the wheel when his leg cramped, and he lost control of the car as it pulled out of the parking lot, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeski </PERSON>. She tried to gain control of the car but could not, he said. Investigators planned to interview the parents over the weekend, Deputy Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said Friday. After the car hit the water, the parents managed to climb out, and passing boaters tossed life jackets to them. `` The man was so exhausted and the woman was hysterical,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoneburner </PERSON>, who said he and a companion threw the flotation devices to the couple from their boat. `` She said, ` I am not leaving without my children. Save my children, they are underwater.''' Police officers were at the scene almost immediately, <PERSON> Rothermal </PERSON> said. One child was pulled out of the car within 15 minutes, and all four were removed within an hour, he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a terse statement Saturday denying a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> news report that 84-year-old senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is seriously ill. `` The report is sheer fabrication with ulterior motives,'' the statement said in full The ministry rarely comments on news reports about major Chinese leaders, particularly <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who repeatedly has been rumored ill, dying or dead over the last few years. However, the latest report came weeks after <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> purged his No. 2 man, Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, setting the stage for a power struggle after his death. The report by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified Chinese sources as saying <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s health deteriorated seriously a few days ago and emergency medical personnel were sent to care for him at a coastal resort east of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It quoted doctors as saying they were discussing whether <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was too ill to be moved to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where better medical facilities are available. The report sent <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s stock market plunging 55.51 points. The only official comment Friday came from the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> office of the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which called the report a mere rumor. No signs emerged of special activity Friday night inside <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>, although lights burned late into the night at the Great Hall of the People. Soldiers stationed around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to enforce martial law were not increased in number. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was last seen in public on June 9, when national television showed him meeting with top army officers and congratulating them on having ended student pro-democracy protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died on June 3-4 in quelling the protests and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. At that time, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> spoke in a strong voice and appeared more alert and healthy than he has for months. He is widely believed to suffer from prostate problems, and over the past few years, there have been periodic reports that he is seriously ill or dying. Chinese sources long have reported that he has little energy and is able to work only a few hours each day.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night approved an $ 18.4 billion spending bill including $ 200,000 to remodel the vice president's official residence to accomodate the young family of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the Office of the President and other smaller agencies for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 was approved by voice vote after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> put aside a controversial amendment to restore <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s military pension. That issue will be taken up as a separate bill later this year. The House version of the spending bill, approved July 28, also provides money for the renovations to the vice presidential mansion _ work that the family had previously said would be done with private funds. The money would go toward work on the third floor of the 19th Century mansion on the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> grounds in an exclusive <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> neighborhood. The three <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> children, ranging in age between 15 and 10, live on that level. When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lived in the home as vice president, the third floor was used for <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office, a maid's bedroom and for storage. The Quayles have raised $ 200,000 but intend to use it for furnishings instead, according to <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Balzano </PERSON>, aide to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> The overall bill contains $ 5.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, $ 300 million more than this year, and $ 1.3 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, $ 100 million above 1989 spending. Both are Treasury agencies. It also cuts $ 30 million out of <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> funds used to allow charities and institutions to enjoy low mailing rates. The provision is aimed at preventing credit card companies from joining with charities to seek business, and thus taking advantage of subsidized mail rates. Another part of the bill would suspend enforcement of a tax law for one year that encourages companies to bestow health insurance on low-level workers and discourages greater benefits for high-level executives than for other employees. Business groups have complained that the requirement is expensive and time-consuming. Like all annual spending bills considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> measure is riddled with special projects for certain lawmakers. Thus, it orders <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to transfer an aircraft it has seized to the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations treasury subcommittee is <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also eliminated money to keep a post office functioning in <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, Miss. <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> happens to be in the district of Rep. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Rejecting the money for a project of interest to the other chamber is a favorite tactic in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enhance one's bargaining position when a compromise bill is fashioned. The two chambers will have to work out compromise legislation after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from its recess in September before sending it to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature.

<TEXT>
 Former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s claim that military mismanagement thwarted two air raids on radical Shiite Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1983 was challenged Friday by former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. `` He's just as unreliable on this as he was on virtually everything else I ever did with him,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said in an interview with television station <ORGANIZATION> WCVB-TV </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview shown Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> WCVB-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s show `` Hostage,'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came close to mounting bombing raids twice in 1983 when government intelligence learned where the Shiites were training. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said the missions were aborted because `` of our own military chain of command.'' In 1983, the truck bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> barracks in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> claimed the lives of hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> servicemen. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had `` extremely good intelligence'' that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen were training in barracks in a valley in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held by factions of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed fundamentailst Shiite group. In the first attempt, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilots circled so long over the area that Syrian air defenses could have been able to `` turn on, track them, shoot them down,'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> blamed the delay on `` inept mismanagement'' by the pilots' superiors. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> called off the second raid, which had been planned with the French government, because the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary felt it was too risky. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>'s decision resulted in `` great damage to our credibility and put an end to any hopes of dealing with these terrorists,'' the former national security adviser said. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> strongly denied the allegation. `` There were certainly no planes in the air about to make a strike that were turned back, and there was most certainly no failure to cooperate,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said. `` Those are just plain myths.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> was unavailable for further comment Friday, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` He said he really had nothing more to say on the subject,'' she said. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said Thursday there was never an effort planned to rescue the hostages because officials never had intelligence on where they were. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> pleaded guilty last year to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to funnel military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. He left his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> post in November 1985, but remained active in policymaking, leading an unsuccessul arms-for-hostages mission to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1986. He attempted suicide in 1987 after the Iran-Contra scandal broke, but since has cooperated with prosecutors by testifying at the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Extend Debt Limit to $2.87 Trillion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday night to temporarily extend the government's debt limit by $ 70 billion to $ 2.87 trillion, granting it authority to borrow enough money to function through the next three months. On a voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval to the extension and sent it to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature. Had the lawmakers not approved the measure before leaving for their four-week summer recess, the government would have run out of money during their vacation and toppled into an unprecedented default. The bill, which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had approved on Tuesday, provides enough borrowing authority to see the government through Oct. 31. On Nov. 1, the temporary authority would lapse and the legal limit on the federal debt will lapse back to its current ceiling of $ 2.8 trillion. By that time, lawmakers hope to complete a long-range permanent debt limit extension to more than $ 3.1 trillion, enough borrowing for about a year. Many legislators hope the long-term extension will contain the elements of a budget deal between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, 1990. Legislative leaders spent much of the last several weeks trying to dissuade lawmakers from offering amendments to the debt limit measure. The extension, considered must-pass legislation, is a favorite target for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with bills that are too controversial to pass if standing alone. The government needs legal authority to borrow money because it runs a deficit every year, a shortfall that has hovered at around $ 150 billion annually for the last three years. It gets the rest of the money it needs each year by borrowing it. When the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration took office in 1981, the national debt was just above $ 900 billion.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s gradual approach to change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may lead to economic or political disaster, Soviet human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told scholars at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Waiting longer for the radicalization of perestroika is out of the question,'' the 68-year-old physicist said Thursday at a luncheon with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs specialists hosted by <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>, the university's president. `` If we allow this to go on, we are threatened with chaos,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said after giving a critical review of his country's problems `` We may be threatened with a military coup. We may be threatened with famine. `` This state is now at a historic moment. It could tip left or right. We have to find a way to hold our course.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said the most immediate danger is the economy, and he joked that `` a good way to tell whether someone is an optimist or a pessimist'' is to ask whether he thinks economic disaster will strike in `` one, two or five years.'' The luncheon, also attended by <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, was held at the residence of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> spoke through a translator. Ms. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, who has also been a longtime critic of Soviet policies, urged <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> nations not to get carried away with uncritical applause for Soviet reforms and not to stop pressing for change. `` The Soviet people are overjoyed to find that, in fact, our country is a living entity,'' she said, recalling the recent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, where open debates kept the nation riveted to its television screens. `` The whole country was amazed and enthusiastic to see that we are alive, that we have n't lost our reason because of the hunger, the trials, the falsification that we've suffered,'' she said. `` If only the West can keep itself from lousing things up.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, was banished to internal exile in the city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> for seven years after criticizing the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He was released in 1986 by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and has since been allowed to speak out and travel freely.

 The armed forces said Friday it broke up a ring of leftist rebels smuggling guns from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. It said it killed one guerrilla, captured five and confiscated 60 Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles in operations that began in central <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on July 28. `` All the arms were new,'' spokesman Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> told a news conference. He called the group `` a subversive cell of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` part of the logistics system organized by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> over the past eight years to obtain arms from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the leftist rebel army that has been at war with a succession of U.S.-backed governments in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since 1980.

He said camps near <LOCATION> Colomoncagua </LOCATION>, where about 10,000 refugees live, were often used by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government `` to send arms to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> identified the slain guerrilla as <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Larin </PERSON>, a 36-year-old Salvadoran who belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla group with members from all over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> passed out after videotaping two young women making love to each other, and the women took $ 200, a bottle of pills and the tape from the actor's hotel room, according to <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> magazine. The women began circulating copies of the tape the next day, according to the article in Aug. 24 editions of the magazine. The article also said most segments of the tape shown on television newscasts showed a <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> sex escapade in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, not the encounter with then-16-year-old <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> and her friend, <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Seburt </PERSON>, at a hotel here during the Democratic National Convention last summer. The videotape consists of three segments, starting with an episode with <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> and a male and a female friend in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> before he went to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the convention, <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> said. The second segment shows <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s visit to an <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> baseball game with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and the third, seven-minute section shows the hotel encounter on July 18, 1988. The movie star and Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> met at <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION>, a downtown dance club, <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> said. The magazine quoted the club's publicity director, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, as saying Miss <PERSON> Seburt </PERSON> called her the morning after the tape was made to tell her about it. Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Seburt </PERSON> told her she and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> they videotaped the encounter with <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> and that when he passed out, they left, taking $ 200 from his wallet, the pills and the tape, <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> said. Miss <PERSON> Seburt </PERSON> wanted to know if the club could make copies of the tape, Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The club could not make copies, but the young women arranged through a friend at a hair salon where they worked to have a video freelancer make copies, <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> said. Two copies were available the day after the taping, and tapes were soon circulating. Publicist <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasteler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PMK </ORGANIZATION> public relations in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, which represents <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, refused Friday to comment on the report that the women were the source of copies of the tape or on the effect the scandal has had on <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s career. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> is filming a movie called `` Bad Influence.'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> declined to be interviewed for <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>'s article, and <PERSON> Kasteler </PERSON> would not provide his number. A telephone call Friday to the home of his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, was not answered.

The Kenyans are the second group of African students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to invade their embassy this summer. About 40 Zairean students staged a 10-day sit-in that ended last week, demanding payment of thousands of dollars in overdue stipends. The Kenyans said they were not in touch with the Zaireans and said their situations are not identical. The Kenyans want plane tickets home for three students who graduated this year and one who withdrew, a substantial increase in their living allowance and better communication between embassy and students. They went to the embassy Monday morning to discuss their complaints. They said they stayed on because their government promised them nothing. They have camped out in the embassy library, sleeping on the floor and sofas, and eating bread and milk. The students spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals from their government. No one at the embassy was immediately available for comment, and later calls were unanswered.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> on Friday abandoned the search for six workers missing from a capsized rig in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Friday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> has exhausted all efforts for the search for the missing people by divers,'' the oil company said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the rig, will salvage it and continue the search for the workers, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Avis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourg </PERSON> officials did not return repeated telephone calls to their office. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on Monday will open hearings into the accident Monday which killed at least four men when the rig capsized Monday. Four crewmen were rescued immediately after the accident. The lift boat, or `` jackup rig,'' with legs that can be moved up while traveling or down while working, remains on its side in 30 feet of water. It overturned while heading for shore while Hurricane Chantal approached. Divers for <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, which had contracted the rig and workers, searched through Thursday night and recovered four bodies from the rig.

<TEXT>
 A thunderstorm doused sections of northeastern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> with up to 5 inches of rain Friday, flooding roads, causing widespread power outages and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of patients from a flooded hospital. Doctors, nurses and ambulance crews worked Friday night to discharge or transfer to other hospitals about 300 patients from <ORGANIZATION> Resurrection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a 434-bed hospital on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> The hospital's basement was flooded and the ground floor was ankle-deep in water at one point, officials said. Patients had no hot water or hot food because of the flooding. Firefighters were working to pump out water from the basement and sub-basement, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngwith </PERSON>. More than 50,000 <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> customers lost electricity at the storm's peak between 4 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., said utility spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. By early afternoon, all but 100 or 200 had power back. `` We're down to just a mop-up operation,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. In the area near <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, `` we got just about our entire total normal monthly rainfall for August,'' in the downpour, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Koeneman </PERSON>, a forecaster with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. O'Hare got 3.45 inches of rain between 1:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., he said. The total normal rainfall for August in the area is 3.53 inches. Flash flood warings went up for northern Kane, Du Page and <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> counties, as well as De <LOCATION> Kalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The Edens Expressway was closed near <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> after 6 a.m. and remained closed until about 10:30 a.m., frustrating commuters, said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> dispatchers. Public safety officers used an inflatable dinghy to rescue a man who was stranded knee-deep in water on the top of his submerged car on the expressway under an overpass in suburban <LOCATION> Northfield </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON>, deputy chief of public safety in <LOCATION> Glencoe </LOCATION>. Power outages hit the northern suburbs the hardest, followed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s north side and the western suburbs, said <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON>. Crews in trucks were hampered by street flooding, he said. The heaviest part of the storm swept a 20-mile-wide band on a line from <LOCATION> Elgin </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koeneman </PERSON> said. Three to five inches of rain fell in the hardest-hit areas, he said. But the rains hit a relatively small region, and `` people who live to south are certainly probably wondering what all the excitement is about.''

<TEXT>
 A lesbian minister who said she was the victim of two anti-gay attacks last month changed her story when police confronted her with evidence some of her injuries were self-inflicted, authorities said Friday. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON>, an assistant pastor at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, resigned from her duties two hours after being placed on administrative leave Thursday night, said Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitulski </PERSON>. `` As a church, we have a lot of compassion for <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, and whatever the truth is, we want to know what the truth is,'' <PERSON> Mitulski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON> has left town and he does n't expect to hear from her again, he said. <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON> said she was attacked first on July 12, hit on the head with a shovel after surprising an assailant who broke into her garage and scrawled anti-gay graffiti on the wall. She received eight stitches. She later alleged that she was abducted July 27 in the <LOCATION> Haight-Ashbury </LOCATION> area by two so-called `` skinheads'' who threw her into a car, beat her up and threatened to kill her before releasing her. Police Chief <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said her account of the first attack was consistent with the evidence, but the medical examiner said physical evidence failed to match her account of a second attack. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> declined to detail the inconsistencies, but a source close to the case told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Medical Examiner <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> determined the injuries she allegedly suffered from the skinheads were self-inflicted. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> also said damage to <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON>' clothing and a subsequent description of how her injuries were received were inconsistent with the evidence or even her account. `` There was no attack as described,'' he added. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> did not return telephone calls made Friday evening by The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. When police presented the inconsistent evidence to <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON> at a meeting with members of the gay community on Thursday, <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON> described a different series of events and said she had been sexually assaulted, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. Police have referred the case to their sex crimes unit and will reconsider all of the evidence, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON> has worked at <ORGANIZATION> MCC </ORGANIZATION> for about 18 months, <PERSON> Mitulski </PERSON> said. `` She did good work with people with AIDS,'' he said. `` She helped a lot of people. This does n't change that ... I ca n't understand why this would happen.'' The church had received a written death threat against <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitulski </PERSON> the night before the first attack, and <PERSON> Mitulski </PERSON> said he has received subsequent death threats over the phone. The alleged attacks, coupled with the recent defacing of a gay man's home, prompted local gay leaders to organize self-defense and gun-handling classes. Reports of inconsistencies in <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON>' case prompted fears among gay advocates that subsequent reports would not be taken seriously by officials or the public. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and others said that regardless of the outcome of the <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON> case, hate crimes will not be tolerated. He said police receive about 10 reports of hate crimes per month, and that other community organizations receive more.

<HEAD>Two `Great Train Robbery' Gangsters Jailed In Drug Case</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> LONDON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Two men convicted 25 years ago in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s `` Great Train Robbery'' case were back in prison Friday after pleading guilty to drug-trafficking charges. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisbey </PERSON>, 59, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON>, 56, was given a 7-year sentence for drug dealing. Both men had been convicted of participating in the Great Train Robbery of Aug. 8, 1963, when a gang of 15 men stole $ 7 million from a mail train. `` You are both old enough and experienced enough to know exactly what you were doing and your motive was greed in each case, regardless of the welfare of your fellow citizens,'' Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> told the defendants at <ORGANIZATION> Snaresbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in east <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before sentencing them Friday. <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wisbey </PERSON> were each sentenced to 30 years in jail in 1964 for their part in the train robbery. <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> was released in December 1975 and Wisbey the following year. At a hearing in the drugs case police testified that they saw the two men exchanging bags containing cocaine in a park. Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> told the court police seized 5.3 pounds of drugs with a street value of more than $ 930,000. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> ordered confiscation of about $ 76,000 found by police at two addresses and with <PERSON> Wisbey </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wisbey </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 10 years for supplying 2.2 pounds of cocaine to <LOCATION> Hussey </LOCATION>. He also was sentenced to 10 years for possession of cocaine with intent to supply and three months for possessing marijuana. The sentences are to run concurrently. <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> pleaded guilty of possessing 2.2 pounds of cocaine with intent to supply. The Great Train Robbery was planned with military precision and at the time was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest robbery. Faking a railroad signal in the countryside northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the gang stopped a mail train traveling from <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. They broke into the mail van, overpowered the crew and stole more than 120 bags full of used banknotes. Less than $ 980,000 was recovered. All 15 members of the gang were caught. One, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, received a 30-year prison sentence, but escaped from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wandsworth </LOCATION> prison on July 8, 1965 He now lives in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, immune from extradition because of legal technicalities.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Half of Americans questioned in a poll disapprove of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric, according to results released Friday. A similar proportion thought President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been `` not tough enough'' in handling the hostage crisis, according to the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll of 711 adults on Wednesday and Thursday. Still, almost as many approved <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handling of the situation. The proportion considering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a `` reliable ally,'' or one that can be trusted to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` in almost any circumstances,'' fell to the lowest level in the eight years that question had been asked, 29 percent. Forty-eight percent said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should return the kidnapped man and 35 percent said he should not be returned. The rest had no opinion. Thirty percent approved of the kidnapping in the first place and 51 percent disapproved. Fifty-one percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not been tough enough, 35 percent said his reaction had been `` just about right'' and 1 percent said he had been too tough. When asked to approve or disapprove the president's handling of the crisis, 47 percent approved and 35 percent disapproved. Forty-eight percent said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should return its captive and 35 percent said it should not. The proportion characterizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as `` not reliable'' rose to 53 percent from 46 percent giving a similar response in April, while those judging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> reliable fell from 51 percent to 29 percent. Since 1981, the proportion applying the term `` reliable'' to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had fluctuated from 40 percent to 64 percent. Those returning a judgment of `` not reliable'' had ranged between 24 percent and 56 percent. In a sample of 711 people, the margin of error is 4.5 percentage points either way, the poll said.

 <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION> will interrupt its tour for the album `` New Jersey'' to headline a `` heavy metal summit'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The first <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Music Peace Festival will be held Aug. 12 and 13 at the 140,000-seat Lenin Stadium. `` We've been out since Halloween,'' leader <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where the group was performing. `` We're 150 shows into the tour. We plan on being out till March of next year. We're the hardest working band in show business, self-proclaimed. We typically do 225 shows a year. `` We come back from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and do the States for a month, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Anywhere they have electricity, we'll play. If they do n't have electricity, just tell us in advance. We'll bring a real long extension cord.'' Also on the Lenin Stadium bill are <ORGANIZATION> Ozzy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osbourne </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crue </PERSON>, Scorpions, <PERSON> Cinderella </PERSON> and Skid Row and, from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Gorky Park, CCCP and Nuance. The shows will be broadcast in 50 countries. The shows are benefits, not for peace as its name implies, but for an educational approach to fighting drug and alcohol abuse in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Ticket sale profits will be divided between the Make a <ORGANIZATION> Difference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and similar organizations in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The foundation uses music and sports figures as role models to get its anti-substance abuse message across. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the concert will be on pay-per-view TV for four hours the evening of Aug. 13. Those in the 11.5 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households equipped for pay-per-view can contact their cable operator to find out how to order it. Westwood One will simulcast the music. Make a <ORGANIZATION> Difference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> receives money from that TV presentation _ the concert wo n't be broadcast on any other channel for at least four months _ and from a <ORGANIZATION> Polygram </ORGANIZATION> recording. The record wo n't be live. Each group will record a song by a star who died of substance abuse. <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> recorded `` The Boys Are Back in Town,'' written by singer-songwriter-bassist <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynnot </PERSON> of <PERSON> Thin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizzy </PERSON>, an Irish band. `` He was a big influence on my career,'' <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> said. `` That was a wonderful band. That song was its only hit, in the mid-1970s. The guy had problems with drugs and it killed him. They broke up before he died. `` It's our first show for drug abuse. What started as a snowflake has turned into an avalanche.'' The band decided to do a concert somewhere for Make a Difference Foundation. The somewhere came to be <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the concert became an East-West festival. `` A lot of people I've grown up with died of drugs or had problems,'' <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> said. `` I was never seriously addicted. I experimented and have since quit.'' But he wo n't speak an anti-drug message. For one thing, he does n't know Russian. For another, `` I'm going there to offer entertainment and an introduction to rock' n' roll, not to be the preacher. `` If my opinion is asked enough times, I'll give it. If I get up in the morning and do a big line of cocaine I do n't think it is going to help me sing and write songs. I do not do drugs. `` I did those commercials ` rockers against drugs.' I was among the first guys who ever did one,'' he said. `` They wanted me to be a poster child. It is difficult for me to be a role model. I'm not vain enough to think I'm perfect. All I want to do is be a singer in a rock band.'' <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> said the group will play `` The Boys Are Back in Town'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but could n't predict what else. `` Everybody is doing 45 minutes,'' he said. `` I figure each concert will go on eight hours.'' He also has been asked to put together a jam session with the other groups. `` Elvis is n't covered on the album and neither are the Rolling Stones. I'll pull a couple of their songs everyone knows.'' -LRB- Rhythm guitarist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> in June 1969 and was found dead three weeks later in his swimming pool, a victim of barbiturates. -RRB- `` We're the last ones to go on,'' <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION> said. `` I'll introduce everyone and bring them on for the jam.

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON>, changing jobs this coming season has meant a radical change of uniform. Instead of the designer clothes she wore as wealthy <PERSON> Sable </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dynasty,'' she'll don a nun's habit for the title role in the new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> sitcom `` Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>.'' `` That's very tiresome, having six costume fittings a week,'' she said. `` It's going to be heaven just being in a little navy-blue skirt and white blouse, thank you very much. That's wardrobe now. <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON>, meeting with television critics who had gathered to preview the new fall shows, said playing a nun is actually closer to her own upbringing than was the role as the rich and flighty Sable. `` Anybody who knows me knows it was more of a stretch for me to do Sable in some ways than it will be for me to do <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> said. `` I'm a little Girl Guide: ` Good, better, best, never let it rest, till the good is better and the better, best.''' <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON>'s `` Sister Kate'' is no sappy Singing Nun, nor is she anything like the earnest, neophyte sister played by <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> in television days of yore. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> is a no-nonsense house mother to a pack of often trying orphans. <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> said she met some activist nuns who help the homeless and she hopes to use them as role models. `` I will be talking to them a lot, because they're very keen that nuns do n't seem wimpy. I think they're sick and tired of singing nuns and soppy nuns. These women are dedicated to improving everybody's lives, and also to not being seen as straight and boring and tiresome. They want to help, and they want to have fun.'' <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> said she also draws from childhood experience for the characterization of tough Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>, having been sent to a convent school when she was a young child in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` My early education was my nuns,'' she said. `` And I love them, I love the nuns that brought me up, and I was very frightened of them. And I look forward to the idea of being as frightening as Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyrill </PERSON> was to me.'' <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> said her upbringing stuck with her and now forms a back story for Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>, including deviations such as posing for photographs that turned up later in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine. `` I think those nuns getting at me at 4 -LCB- was very, very important,'' she said. `` I think I owe them a hell of a lot. ... What is it? ` Give me a child until he is 6 and I will show you the man'? I'm sure that's true. When these kids that she's looking after now grow old and get married, they would always come back to visit this crusty nun. It's much deeper in my background than is some billionaire's wife. The show comes from three executive producers, two of whom are veterans of `` Barney <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.'' One of the latter, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, told the television critics that, in a way, he was glad to be in the tough time period that `` Sister Kate'' has drawn for the fall: opposite CBS' powerhouse `` Murder, She Wrote'' on Sunday evenings. `` It's actually a good time slot because you're not expected to win,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. `` I mean, we're not expected to go in there and get a 45 share -LRB- percentage of audience -RRB-. We're expected to go in there and do a good show and survive.'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said he and the other producers saw `` hundreds'' of people for the part of Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>, and even though they knew <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> was still under contract to `` Dynasty,'' once they saw her, the part was hers.

 <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> erupted into violence on Aug. 14, 1969. Twenty years and 2,740 deaths later, the violence continues. But much has changed in recent years and some in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province are beginning to see the foundations of a solution. Here is a report by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent who covers <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> regularly.

 All Mrs. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s neighbors are gone. The house she and her husband bought on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> stands alone in a no-man's land, its windows protected by steel mesh and a tall corrugated wall separating the Roman Catholic couple from <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> families 200 yards down the street. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s neighborhood once was mixed, with Protestants and Roman Catholics living side by side. But <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s violence came to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> and the stonings and firebombings proved more than Mrs. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s neighbors could bear They went off to live among their own and authorities tore down their houses. But the <ORGANIZATION> Murphys </ORGANIZATION> held out. It all happened not 20 years ago, when `` The Troubles'' were at their worst in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province, also known as Ulster, but just five months ago, and the houses razed were not hovels but new showcases of a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> rising from the Victorian slums. `` It's something of an indictment of society here,'' says <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maginnis </PERSON> of the Housing Executive that had to make the decision. `` It's an awful tragedy.'' It's easy to conclude from this million-dollar exercise that little has changed in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since British troops arrived Aug. 14, 1969 to separate rioting Protestants from their Catholic neighbors. The death toll is over 2,740 and rising almost week by week. The Catholic unemployment rate is 2 -LCB- times that of Protestants. A political solution still looks far off. And yet one finds a glimmer of optimism in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> today. Violence has diminished from a peak of 467 killings in 1972 to an average of 80 a year in the 1980s. Recent elections suggest a weakening of the hard-liners on both sides of the divide and a boost for the moderates. In the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> to the south, the political mold shaped in the country's 1921-23 civil war has cracked and opened new possibilities for a solution that can accommodate both <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> and Nationalist in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Unionists are the majority Protestants intent on retaining union with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and Nationalists are the 40-percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority whose aspirations lean to the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The Irish government in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> has not renounced its claim to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It simply does n't state it too loudly. It is in consensus with the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government that nothing can change without <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> consent. In a half dozen of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s 26 district councils, moderate Catholics and Protestants have joined in coalitions to shut out the extremists on both sides. <PERSON> Dungannon </PERSON>, a town of 15,000 in the center of the province, was once a bastion of Unionist supremacy and discrimination. Now its mixed council has a committee to promote cross-community understanding and sends <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> children on vacations together. The whole island, north and south, is in intellectual ferment over the prospect that a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ beginning with the lowering of trade barriers in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1992 _ will subsume old nationalist rivalries in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` National sovereignty is changing its whole meaning in European terms,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the province's main Catholic nationalist party. `` The nation state is disappearing. So the fundamental reason for the quarrel between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is now gone.'' A backwater 20 years ago, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> now has air links to European resorts. A burgeoning Catholic middle class hungers for stability. A retail boom has transformed the bombed-blackened city centers of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>'s family was driven out of their home in 1973 by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> mobs. Married now with a baby son, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> owns a house in a quiet <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> suburb. He is one of the thousands who look back on the old days and pray they'll never return. By pouring some $ 2.25 billion a year into the province, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> can actually buy pockets of stability. Councilor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McGonnell </PERSON>, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, says <PERSON> Dungannon </PERSON>'s new approach is helped along by the knowledge that `` if a council is seen to be trying to work together, central government is much more sympathetic towards it.''

 <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a 52-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> councilor whose appliance store on <PERSON> Dungannon </PERSON>'s main street has been damaged 11 times by <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombs, strongly backs municipal power-sharing. `` A lot of trust has been built up,'' he says. `` People are really bending over backward at the moment to try and ensure that nothing major goes wrong.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bew </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, was deeply pessimistic in the mid-1980s. Now he feels things are looking up. `` I am more modestly optimistic about some kind of accommodation in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> than I have been for a long, long time,'' he says. <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> suggests a round-table conference of all the parties _ the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and the Northerners _ to define the problem, then solve it. Unionists prefer some sort of power-sharing arrangement with Catholics, provided the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government is not involved. That distance between the two positions is great, but at least the two sides are talking about solutions. The trouble is that life is not improving in the blue-collar ghettoes, where pockets of 80-percent unemployment provide recruits for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, its political backer in the campaign to end British rule in Ulster and unite it with the southern republic. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> city councilor, says none of the prosperity of recent years has reached his constituency. And the Dungannon spirit has n't reached <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, whose Unionist-dominated council has n't given a single committee seat to a Nationalist. <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, a 36-year-old man with `` <LOCATION> IRELAND </LOCATION>'' tattooed on his arm, says he has endured jailings, internment without trial, countless arrests and house searches, and all because `` I believe that <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people have a right to resist British rule in this country.'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, the voice of Catholic moderation, denounces the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, producing statistics indicating that two-thirds of those killed since 1969 were Catholics, and 44 percent of them victims of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> have killed six times more people than the British army and 30 times more people than the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Royal Ulster Constabulary -RRB-. ... Those figures alone would force anybody to say to themselves, ` Hold on a minute, where are our methods leading us?''' <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> was set up in 1921 as a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> enclave when the rest of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> won independence and became a Protestant fiefdom rife with gerrymandering, police brutality and discrimination in housing and jobs. In 1968, <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> began demanding civil rights. Violent Protestant reaction brought in the British army, which soon found itself at war with the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. In 1972, the government in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> closed <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and assumed direct rule. In 1985, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement giving <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> a say in the running of the province. Outraged Unionists, who regard <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as a hostile Catholic state, reacted violently. But their protests were ignored, and they are finally beginning to talk about negotiating a solution. Meanwhile, some Catholics concede that many of the grievances of the 1960s have been rectified. Gerrymandering and housing discrimination have been swept away by decree from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Under new fair-employment laws, employers guilty of discrimination face fines the equivalent of $ 48,000 and the loss of government grants and contracts. But unemployment is around 18 percent, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest, and violence drives away investment and jobs. Policing remains a thorny problem. The Royal Ulster Constabulary went some way toward evenhandedness by standing up to the riots against the Anglo-Irish Agreement. But every Catholic, moderate or militant, has a story to tell of physical or verbal abuse by the mostly Protestant security patrols. <PERSON> McGonnell </PERSON> says security-force misbehavior is one of the major reasons why the vote for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the political wing of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, still hovers around 11 percent. <PERSON> Bew </PERSON>, the Queen's <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> analyst, believes that only massive aid for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> can eat into <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>'s support there.

 It is 9:45 on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday morning and you are standing by the driveway outside the <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building. Up draws a limousine and out pour the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and a squad of briefcase-toting colonels. Here comes another and out comes the secretary of agriculture. Then the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, the surgeon general in starchy white. It is something to see, the arrival of officialdom at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' doorsteps to appear before committees and subcommittees, to ask, to explain, to defend, to dodge, to woo _ and to demonstrate that the checks and balances concept is alive and well in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Officials arrive at other congressional buildings and the Capitol itself, but because all going to Rayburn use a single entrance, it is a fine place to behold the phenomenon. Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays are best, because those are <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' three full workdays. Every town has a few places, people or phenomena that are uniquely its own _ just as the waltz of arriving officialdom is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s alone. Here are a few other <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> institutions: _ The Billy Goat Trail It is a hiking trail on the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> banks of the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>. If you think of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as an effete city where no work gets done but words get spoken, the terrain's unexpected roughness, in such proximity to the city, will surprise you Why, one could fall off the trail and roll down the steep hillside into the rocks of the Potomac! No <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to come to the rescue. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Evangelidi </PERSON>, a hiking writer, says of the four-mile Billy Goat Trail: `` It is shaped by many elements of nature. At times it is inundated and scoured by rampaging floods of the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>. Its unusual flora barely survives in the hot, dry relentless summer suns and rocky geography.'' He suggests you watch out for snakes. There are places where you'll find yourself hiking on all fours, or grabbing hold of a wedge of rock. You might as well be in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. _ Red Lion Row This is quintessential <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> architecture: the architecture of compromise. The owners wanted to tear down the late Federal and Greek Revival and Victorian houses along the 2000 block of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, four blocks west of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to make room for yet another block-long behemoth office building. Preservationists said no, those little houses are vital reminders of the scale and style of the city as it was when <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> paced the streets. A bargain was reached. The old two-story buildings were saved and converted to stores and offices; the behemoth rose attached to and behind them. The old houses, not just their facades, were retained; this was not just another face-saving gesture. Like most compromises, what results is not entirely satisfactory to everyone. _ <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> This entertainer came here about the same time <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did but outlasted his fellow showman. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to play the banjo and tell tall tales for a few weeks' run in a basement theater at at Arena Stage. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, charmed, wo n't let him go A man of beguiling passion, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> reminds people of their human commonality. He has revised his act, but the title of his first show best gives the flavor: `` Banjo Dancing, or the 48th Annual Squitters Mountain Song Dance Folklore Convention and Banjo Contest and How I Lost.'' _ <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>'s Meadows Washingtonian <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> is a citizen nature-lover who by dint of determination became a National Park Service ranger. Then she persuaded the authorities to stop mowing the grass in a few swatches of <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, which runs through the city. Controversy, as you can imagine, ensued. Some people think unmowed grass is mayhem, and even a park needs discipline, but <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> prevailed. Twenty-three of the park's 3,000 acres were allowed to go wild. They are mowed once a year to keep them from becoming forests. The result: not lawn, not woods, but something in between. The next result: new flora and fauna that flourish only under such circumstances. Voila! Goldfinches, short-tailed shrews, purpletop grass, six-feet tall bull thistles, owls, the pearl crescent butterfly _ all thriving where they otherwise had n't and would n't. Like <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s banjo, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s Meadows are a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> miracle, the unexpected pleasure; like the high-stepping colonels, the short-tailed shrews are a sight to behold.

 Ruined medieval fortresses stand silhouetted against the sky on scorched mountaintops across <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and atop each one flies a flag of the Georgian independence movement. The flags fly as well on police outposts and are sold at <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> newsstands in the form of lapel pins and dashboard suction cups. One hangs over a highway from a peasant's plot, This land of glaciered crags, fruit-filled valleys and <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> beaches is seething with resentment against the `` invaders'' from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> who took over their infant republic in 1921. Since troops armed with sharp shovels and toxic gas clashed with pro-independence protesters in this capital April 9, killing 19 of them, sympathy has grown for those Georgians who want to secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Socialist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ a kingdom on its own in the Middle Ages _ also is rent by ethnic violence, much of it pitting Christian Georgians against Moslem minorities. It is an explosive combination on the heels of April 9. `` This is the last thing <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> needs right now,'' says <PERSON> Gizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Grzeledze </PERSON>, an official in the Georgian Foreign Ministry. `` It will bring the troops back.'' The ethnic violence is spawned in part by reaction to the Georgians' rising nationalism. Hatreds and resentments dating back to the medieval times have reappeared among the dozen nationalities in the republic, which is about half the size of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Conflicts pitting Georgians against Moslem Abkhazians and Azerbaijanis have cost 26 lives and injured more than 450 in several areas of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> since the summer began. Georgians in the Meskhetian area guard their homes against ethnic Turks living there. At the same time, independence activists persuaded tens of thousands of workers to walk off their jobs in a general strike, crippling transport and even a military jet factory. Thousands more have gathered in daily illegal meetings in downtown <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. Even officials in the government ministry across the street from the gathering were hanging out their windows one recent day to listen to activist <PERSON> Sviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsachurdia </PERSON>, who said that in 1976 he could count just 20 or 30 people willing to join his call for independence. In a <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> suburb, vandals smashed the face and tore the head off a statue of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, the revered founder of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while a statue of the dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, a Georgian, stands unscathed. The combustible mixture of nationalist unrest and ethnic violence is risky not only for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> but also the rest of the country, said <PERSON> Shalva </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanidze </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader of the <LOCATION> Akhaltsike </LOCATION> region in the Meskhetian area. By strengthening the hard-liners, he maintained, the activists are endangering all of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its moves toward democracy and economic autonomy. More than 100 ethnic groups live in the 15 Soviet republics. But <PERSON> Gamsachurdia </PERSON>, a grey-haired veteran of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s resistance to Soviet power, says he is concerned only with the fate of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>; the fate of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, he maintains, is threatened by what he sees as Islamic fundamentalism spilling over the border from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It is a measure of the Georgian public's sharing in <LOCATION> Gamsachurdia </LOCATION>'s belief that the question activists and <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> officials alike pose to a visitor is not whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would help <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> break from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but whether it would help an independent, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> against Islamic fundamentalist <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The independence demonstrations of April have turned into demonstrations involving ethnic differences and religious backgrounds. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> remains deeply rooted among Georgians and still commands respect, although the Soviet government fosters atheism. A number of very old churches have been preserved in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Conflict between Christians and Moslems goes back centuries in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region, particularly in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Thousands of Georgians filled <LOCATION> Rustaveli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ave. </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> daily demonstrations during recent ethnic rioting between Georgians and Moslems in the Abkhazian region, a <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort area. Commanders of the 4,500 Soviet troops sent to quell the rioting said there were attempts to provoke the troops into firing on the population in what would have been a horrifying repeat of April 9 in <LOCATION> Tblisi </LOCATION>. A letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> charged that the violence in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> was organized by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It asked for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops because, it claimed, Soviet troops were protecting only Abkhazians, not Georgians. Col. Gen. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatalin </PERSON> of the Soviet army said his troops confiscated thousands of weapons from both Georgians and Abkhazians, including explosives and machine guns. <PERSON> Lovard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tukhashvili </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>, Archeology and Ethnography said he believes the rioting was instigated by Abkhazians who stand to lose their privileges to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms or to an independent <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Abkhazians number just 80,000, 17 percent of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s 5.3 million people, but they dominate the power structure and managerial jobs in their region, <PERSON> Tukhashvili </PERSON> said. The Abkhazians contend, however, they are struggling for equal rights and feel they will achieve them only by seceding from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and becoming a 16th republic of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to Abkhazian legislator <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardzinba </PERSON>. Minorities in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> are reacting to growing Georgian nationalism, inextricably woven into the independence movement, <PERSON> Ardzinba </PERSON> said. But Georgians tell outsiders that this is <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> land. Abkhazians, Azerbaijanis and Meskhetian Turks make equally detailed claims to the contrary. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was a kingdom from the 4th century B.C. to the 14th century A.D. In 1555, western <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> fell to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It became part of the Russian Empire in 1783 and had a spell of independence in 1918-21, after the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> seized power in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Because Georgians resisted the new Soviet power, a quarter of their land was turned over to other ethnic groups. <PERSON> Tukhashvili </PERSON>, the historian, said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> did his fellow Georgians no favors when he had whole nationalities deported from traditional homelands to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. For example, he said, the Georgians who moved onto the lands of the deported Meskhetian Turks now face nearly 400,000 Meskhetians clamoring to return and reclaim their homes. For Grzeledze of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, it is no coincidence that the Azerbaijanis, Turks and most of the Abkhazians are Moslems, traditional enemies of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> voluntarily joined the Russian Empire because it was the only Christian alternative to domination by Turks and Persians. Nearly two centuries have passed, but the geography has n't changed <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION> is now revolutionary <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, under the rule of Moslem mullahs dedicated to spreading Islamic fundamentalism, and the high birth rates of Moslems have the Georgians fearful of becoming minorities in their own land.

 `` We are not guests!'' says <PERSON> Achmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragimov </PERSON>, an Azerbaijani engineer in this city in the south of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` We feel this is our land.'' Georgians are equally vehement that the area around <LOCATION> Marneuli </LOCATION> is traditionally Georgian, and the dispute is not ancient history here. In June, five people died in ethnic violence in the district. Georgians claim they are gracious hosts who welcome refugees and bear no ill will to other ethnic groups. But they infuriate the Abkhazian, <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> and Turkish residents of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> by insisting they are just guests. `` I certainly do n't feel like a guest,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasanov </PERSON>, who lives in a largely <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Marneuli </LOCATION>. `` My family has been here for 200 years.'' Growing Georgian demands for independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is now a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic _ have prompted the Azerbaijanis of the <LOCATION> Marneuli </LOCATION> area to call for secession from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The population of the area is now three-quarters Azerbaijani due to the Moslem preference for large families. One summer night in <LOCATION> Marneuli </LOCATION>, an industrial city, a car full of youths careened about the town warning of an impending attack by Georgians. `` Several thousand men gathered, armed with axes, iron bars, clubs, and knives,'' said a local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official, T.G. Beridze. `` But nothing happened,'' said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleshnina </PERSON>, another party official. She added, however, that men carying green Islamic flags moved on to the nearby towns of <LOCATION> Bolnisi </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dmanisiu </PERSON>, spreading the word: `` The Georgians are finished with <LOCATION> Marneuli </LOCATION> and now they are coming to get you.'' Fighting soon broke out, and the five deaths occurred there, she said. The 17-year-old <PERSON> Gasanov </PERSON> also blamed Georgian discrimination for his inability to find a job. <PERSON> Ragimov </PERSON> complained that Georgians commuting from <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the republic's capital, are claiming all the local managerial jobs. Several older residents in the crowd that quickly gathered around a visiting correspondent insisted that the multi-national residents of <LOCATION> Marneuli </LOCATION> `` live together like brothers.'' `` I was born here, and I've never had any problems,'' said <PERSON> Farida </PERSON> <PERSON> Orudjeva </PERSON>. `` This land is Soviet. It's not his or mine.'' But that sentiment, which native Georgian <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> tried to instill by uprooting whole nationalities from their homelands, is proving to be rare among the myriad minorities of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Every day at noon, Estonian activists gather in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to collect signatures for a proposed referendum on the secession of their Baltic republic from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a right guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution. Five years ago, before the reforms of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, such a petition would have been a sure ticket to prison. Even a year ago, such a notion seemed out of the question. But for nearly 500,000 non-Estonians in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republic it could mean trouble and some are raising their voices in protest. In late July, several thousand of non-Estonians struck major factories in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, returning to work only when the Estonian government set up a commission to assuage their fears that they might someday be exiled from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. `` A lot of people have no other homeland. Where would we go?'' said <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Korol </PERSON>, of the 56-member coordinating committee of Intermovement, formed last summer by <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> residents of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. `` We just want to defend ourselves. We want our children to grow up here,'' said <PERSON> Korol </PERSON>, assigned by <PERSON> Intermovement </PERSON> as liaison with the strikers. Every day, the drama is acted out at the petition table in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. A muscular man strides up to the table and writes on a petition in Russian: `` Throw the Estonians out of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> so they wo n't disgrace us. He marches off, without signing his name. The situation is similar in the two neighboring <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republics </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and Lithuanian, where Russian-speaking movements have organized to counter the march to autonomy. The conflict stems from the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, which gave <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> most of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and gave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Baltic republics. Recent Baltic newspaper accounts have reported that hundreds of thousands of Balts were killed or exiled under <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> occupation, and a government commission in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is reviewing the 1939 pact to determine whether <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of the Baltic republics was legal. `` A lot of time has passed since the 1940s. It's not our fault how the war turned out,'' said <PERSON> Korol </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> since his mother, a war widow, married a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldier and moved here in 1944, when <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> was 3. Since the annexation, hundreds of thousands of non-Estonians have settled in the republic, working mostly in heavy industries that the Estonians complain pollute their environment without giving them material benefit. Of the 1.6 million people in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, 65 percent are Estonian by nationality, and most of the rest are `` Russian-speakers'' from Slavic republics, 28 percent Russian, 3 percent Ukrainian and 2 percent Byelorussian. The Baltic republics won a major victory July 27 when the national legislature in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> voted overwhelming for a law that would grant them economic autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> starting Jan. 1. Details remain to be worked out and the law must be voted on twice more, but <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronshtein </PERSON>, author of the idea, said in an interview it will allow <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lativa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to print their own currencies and take control of industry and agriculture from Moscow-based ministries. But `` the Estonian people are realists'' and will not seek full independence, said <PERSON> Bronshtein </PERSON>, 66, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and head of the political-economic faculty at <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tartu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The Russians will not be exiled, but their status will change, said <PERSON> Rein </PERSON> <PERSON> Veidemann </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the mass movement that is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for greater autonomy. `` Until now, they have lived like a privileged class,'' he added in an interview. `` They came, got new apartments more quickly than Estonians, and quickly landed places in the governing apparatus. `` We want an equal chance to take part in governing <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>.'' Russian residents want to stop what they see as the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>' slide toward independence They claim their rights were undercut by laws recently passn for office. `` We're against separatism,'' said <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Anson </PERSON>, 46, a truck driver and chairman of the strike committee at the <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> Autotransport Affialiate No. 8. Interviewed at the <LOCATION> Tallin </LOCATION> Ship Repair Yard with other strikers, <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> said his family was exiled from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and that he settled here in 1965. `` My wife, a Byelorussian, worked for 22 years in one of the worst factories here, and we just got an apartment in 1987,'' <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> said. The Soviet government owns virtually all housing and much of its is controlled by state-run factories, such as the one his wife works for. `` Now, the Estonian legislature has passed a law making Estonian the official language,'' <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> added. `` The other day, we got a letter written in <LOCATION> Estonian </LOCATION> saying that she must take an examination in Estonian in two months. If she does n't pass, she can be fired for lack of professional qualifications and we will lose the apartment. We will have nowhere to live.'' The Ansons have a 16-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter. Another strike committee member, shipyard worker <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakariadze </PERSON>, moved to <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in 1983. He married another Georgian two years ago, and they now have two children. After living in dormitories for five years, he became elegible to move with his family into a two-room apartment last year. `` But the city executive committee would not let me move there, because I had not lived in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. They said Estonians should get first crack at new apartments,'' said <PERSON> Zakariadze </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to hold a plenum on nationality problems in July, at which the Baltic dispute would be on the agenda. But Kremlin leaders have postponed the session while they grapple behind the scenes with the emotions that have boiled to the surface with the greater openness in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and congressional negotiators reached agreement Thursday night on financing a sweeping $ 159 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> torpedoed a Democratic plan. The compromise was reached after a series of fast-paced developments in which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threatened to veto the bill, the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ignored him in on a 221-199 vote in favor of it and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> fell six votes short of mustering the 60 needed to complete action. That automatically tossed the bill back into a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, which locked up the deal after 11 p.m.. Approval is expected by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and then the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, on Friday, the last day before the August colngressional vacation Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> accepted a compromise proposal splitting the cost of the bailout so that only 40 percent of the $ 50 billion needed immediately would balloon the federal deficit. The deal calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to borrow $ 20 billion this year, raising the estimated deficit from $ 149 billion to $ 169 billion, and borrowing by a new agency to raise the $ 30 billion balance next year and the year after without counting that in the official deficit. `` Obviously we've only had an opportunity to make a quick review, but based on that review ... in the spirit of which the president sent us here, which was one of compromise, we accept,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. The compromise was approved on a 26-22 vote among <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of the conference committee despite vehement objections from Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., was the only one of the five <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to vote against the deal All of the money would be used to close some 500 insolvent S & amp; Ls _ the bulk of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ and pay off savers whose federally insured deposits were lost through failed an often fraudulent loans. The administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had reached agreement long ago on the bulk of the legislation directing a massive overhaul of the industry's structure and regulation in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the cisis. But a confrontation over the financing which one Democrat characterized as a `` game of chicken'' had threatened to blow the deal apart. With S & amp; L losses mounting at a rate of $ 20 million to $ 30 million a day, both the administration and congressional leaders were adamant in their demands that the fix be approved before the vacation recess. `` Ninety percent of the people want to get out of here,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` They have reservations for vacation.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> earlier had called the $ 20 billion - $ 30 billion, on-budget-off-budget split `` conceptually sound'' but declined to give it a blanket endorsement without a vote on it among the congressional negotiators Prior to Thursday night, the administration has steadfastly demanded that all of the bailout's costs be raised 30-year bonds issued outside the normal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowing process, and outside the official deficit. The bill also would institute a major overhaul of the government's regulation of the nation's nearly 3,000 thrifts and require their owners to put billions of dollars more of their own money at risk. `` Both of them are turkeys,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said of the alternative <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democratic plans for raising the bailout's costs `` It's a question of the lesser of two evils.'' Democrats contended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan would increase the cost by $ 150 million a year over the next three decades because the bonds would carry higher interest rates than normal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury obligations. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, described the dispute as `` politics, plain and simple.'' `` The only difference now is they -LRB- Republicans -RRB- do not want the deficit number to go up the first year of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' he said. `` If it did not cost any money to not tell the truth, that would be fine. But not telling the truth is going to cost $ 4.5 billion to $ 60 billion.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued his veto threat early in the day, shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> began debating the bill that has been months in the drafting. `` If the conference report is presented to me in its current form, I will veto the bill,'' he said. `` While Gramm-Rudman-Hollings is not perfect, it represents the only available institutional requirement for fiscal discipline by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch.'' Over the next 10 years, the costs, including interest, would rise to $ 159 billion, according to the latest administration estimates. The interest costs over future years push the three-decade total for the rescue to more than $ 285 billion _ $ 157 billion of it from taxpayers. S & amp; Ls would have to devote more of their lending to home mortgages. Their investments in risky real estate ventures would be curtailed and their purchases of junk bonds would be outlawed. It also would remove five decades of prohibitions on bank ownership of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, enabling banks to buy out their most competitive lending market rivals in many communities. A new government agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would be established to dispose of between $ 100 billion and $ 400 billion in real estate and other property falling into the government's custody The property was used as collateral behind loans that defaulted when real estate markets _ particularly in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> _ collapsed with declining oil prices, contributing to the failure of more than 200 S & amp; Ls last year alone.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar gained against <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies this morning. Gold prices retreated from Thursday's peaks in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading. Dealers attributed the dollar's advance during <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and early European trading mostly to position-squaring ahead of the release today of July <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures. The threat of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is lending additional support to the currency, they said. `` People had been already short, and then came the events in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Totzauer </PERSON>, a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The dollar is politically supported, and the -LRB- job -RRB- figures are already expected to be very weak, so the chances for a rise a good.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 138.05 yen, up 1.65 yen from Thursday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar declined to 137.85 yen. The pound traded at $ 1.6350, down from $ 1.6475 late Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday: 1.8763 West German marks, up from 1.8650; 1.6147 Swiss francs, up from 1.6065; 6.3550 French francs, up from 6.3192; 2.1157 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0950; 1,351.80 Italian lire, up from 1,338.00, and 1.1740 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1715.

 An expert in cutting through gobbledygook is offering some free advice on how to cut the federal deficit and ease taxpayer anxieties: simplify federal tax forms. `` Further simplification of tax forms and instructions _ without compromising technical accuracy _ is possible,'' says <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Redish </PERSON>, a linguist. `` The payoff would far exceed the investment.'' `` Such a project has the potential to collect billions of dollars in taxes that are not now paid and the potential to change the public's perception of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and of government in general,'' Ms. <PERSON> Redish </PERSON> said Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Redish </PERSON>, who recently wrote a `` user-friendly'' owner's manual for the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taurus </ORGANIZATION>, cited the basic 1040, the most common individual form, as visually overwhelming and incredibly crowded `` It has 65 numbered items _ and several unnumbered ones _ all on one piece of paper ... boxes on the left for some items and on the right for others. It means that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> uses small type for most lines and then condenses that type even further to fit all the words in other lines,'' she said. She got no argument from the subcommittee. Chairman <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, had the Ways and Means hearing room decorated for the occasion with a copy of each of the 392 federal tax forms _ enough paper, he said, to produce a stack thicker than the District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> yellow pages. `` Do you need so many?'' <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> asked a panel of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` I'm afraid so,'' replied <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, who is in charge of the agency's tax forms coordinating committee. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said that as a result of the big tax overhaul that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted in 1986, the agency had to create 88 new forms and revise 162 others. `` So much for simplification,'' <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> complained. `` Our tax forms and publications are often the first -LRB- and sometimes the only -RRB- contact taxpayers have with the service,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has no interest in making tax forms complicated.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is constantly reviewing to determine how forms and publications can be simplified. In the works now, he said, are a simplified Form 1040A for older taxpayers, which will include new lines for retirement income, and a study to determine why only about one-quarter of the taxpayers who were eligible to shift from the long Form 1040 to a shorter form did so this year. Also, he said there will be a study that could lead to an overhaul of the W-2 form, on which wages are reported by employers, and new publications offering tax guidance for the military and for students.

<HEAD>Task Force Studying Design Changes for DC-10, Other Big Airliners</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ A government task force will study possible design changes in DC-10s and other wide-body airliners that will allow pilots to retain control after an engine blowup or other in-flight failure. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announcement Thursday of the government and industry task force came two weeks after the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 that killed 111 people in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. An explosive engine failure apparently destroyed the plane's hydraulic flight controls. The agency said similar incidents involving a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in 1985 and an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 in 1981 indicate design changes may be needed to further protect flight-control systems in flight. All three planes, each built by a different manufacturer, lost hydraulic power that controls wing and tail surfaces. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, called for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to consider grounding all DC-10s. In a letter to the agency, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> cited news accounts saying that lives might have been saved in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crash if the DC-10 had four rather than three hydraulic systems or a shut-off valve to prevent hydraulic fluid loss. `` If these allegations are true, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should ground all DC-10s and correct their design flaws immediately,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> safety regulations, said the planes would not be grounded. `` There are no design flaws in the DC-10 or any other aircraft presently flying that warrant grounding,'' he said. About the task force, <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> said that safety improvements to protect flight control systems `` are within the realm of technical and economic feasibility.'' The task force, he said, will include experts from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, airlines, manufacturers, industry groups and foreign aviation safety officials. The review eventually will cover all airliners that rely on hydraulic controls, including those built by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> consortium, he said. Failure of hydraulic systems, <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> said, indicates the need for considering an extra level of safety in airliners. The task force will be asked to come up with `` a system or a modification of existing systems'' to allow an airliner to fly and land safely even with complete hydraulic failure. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> approves design, construction, testing and operation of all planes used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. Many foreign governments follow its lead. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the study also would cover engine design `` with an eye toward possibly preventing crippling damage to an aircraft in the event of an engine explosion.'' In the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crash, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the center engine apparently ruptured, sending shrapnel through the engine casing, disabling the primary hydraulic system and its two backups. The <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> crash also involved a loss of control after a rear pressure wall ruptured, knocking out part of the vertical stabilizer and rudder, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. In the L-1011 incident, the plane landed safely after parts of its center engine penetrated the fuselage and three of its four hydraulic systems were cut and the fourth damaged, <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requires that jet engines be built to contain fragments of fans, compressors or turbine blades that may break off in flight. But the agency says its regulation recognizes that `` there is no practical way to contain the parts on which the blades are mounted _ the disks _ when they fail because of their weight and the speed at which they travel.''

 Fewer major airline flights are arriving on time, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> consumer report. The department said Thursday that the 13 largest domestic carriers reported 72.2 percent of their flights arrived on time in June, compared with 79.5 percent for May. The department said East Coast weather was largely to blame. Delays caused by mechanical problems are not counted in the monthly Air Travel Consumer Report. The report showed a surge in complaints to the government about airlines, with 1,119 received in July, a 30 percent increase over June complaints. The overall trend, however, continued to be a decline, with July complaints down 43 percent from the 1,969 filed for the same month last year. The department keeps a file of consumer data on performance of specific flights, airlines and airports. Much of the information is made available through travel agents.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is investigating another drug company to determine whether it misrepresented samples of one of its products to win <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> Copiague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Thursday that it `` unequivocally denies'' that any of the research, formulation, manufacture or testing of its generic version of Dyazide was compromised The allegation of possible fraud came from Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, which started the probe into the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug division He said documents obtained by the panel from a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> testing laboratory show that <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> `` may well have substituted'' samples of the originally approved brand-name Dyazide, made by <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION>, for its own generic version to win <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval. In June, another company, <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> its company employees appear to have switched samples of its generic Dyazide with the brand-name product to gain approval. <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> are the only two companies that won <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval to market generic versions of the popular hypertension drug, a combination of hydrochlorthizide and triamterene. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Par </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, recalled its generic version of the high blood pressure drug Maxzide because samples of the product were misrepresented in a government inspection. In each of the cases, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and the companies have said they have found no evidence of safety problems with the drugs, though <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials say there are concerns the drugs may be less effective than they were supposed to be. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> and Par are among 11 drug makers being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is analyzing drug samples <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> submitted to the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> lab and that though the results are not final, `` the preliminary data has raised some questions.'' Generic drugs are lower-cost versions of brand-name products whose patents have expired. Before they are approved for sale, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> requires that tests show they are chemically equivalent to the brand-name products. Dyazide and its generic competitors are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the country. Before its first generic competition appeared in 1987, Dyazide sales were more than $ 300 million annually. However, when <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> put its generic version on the market, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s Dyazide sales dropped 45 percent, to $ 200 million in 1988, according to Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> reported overall sales for the first half of 1989 of $ 69.8 million. Its generic Dyazide is the company's largest selling drug, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> vice president. She declined to say what the company's generic Dyazide sales were, but said it was less than half of total product sales. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said the testing lab, <ORGANIZATION> PharmaKinetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, conducted a visual examination on <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s samples and compared them to <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s, just as the lab had done in the case of <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION>. As with <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PharmaKinetics </ORGANIZATION> found a color difference between the samples tested in a bioequivalency study and samples from more recent batches of the product, according to memos from lab officials that were turned over to the subcommittee. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> said in its statement that the company `` reaffirms its complete faith in the safety, effectiveness, bioequivalence and quality of the product. The test data submitted to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to gain approval reflect that <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s formulation is equivalent to Dyazide.'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s subcommittee has been investigating fraud and corruption in the generic drug division of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for months. Information the panel uncovered and turned over to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> has resulted in charges against several drug companies and their officials as well as <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employees.

 Two centuries after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports. Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban areas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patterns of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing faster than that in rural areas. The `` rural renaissance'' reported in the 1970s when small towns and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in cities and suburbs now well in the lead. The census study found that about 86 percent of the nation's population growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officially designated metropolitan areas across the country That pattern represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has been common since the era of the Great Depression, the bureau reported. The analysis of 1987 figures found that nearly half of all Americans, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37 metro areas with populations of a million or more. Led by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, these metro areas had 119 million residents in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> leads the way as the only state entirely included within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion of the state is included in the greater <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metro area while the southern portion is part of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> region. Seven other states have more than 90 percent of their populations in metropolitan areas _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> is the least metropolitan state with only about 20 percent of its residents in urban areas, the report added. Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan area growth has tended to flow to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in recent years, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> observed in its study of growth patterns between 1980 and 1987. The population loss experienced in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> during the 1970s has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> has continued to have net losses in recent years. `` A slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 in much of the interior of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, especially in nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starsinic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forstall </PERSON>. During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10 contiguous states _ <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the bureau pointed out. The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as of July 1, 1987, were <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 18.0 million; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 13.5 million; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 8.1 million; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, 5.9 million; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 5.9 million; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 4.6 million; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 4.1 million; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 3.7 million; Also <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 3.6 million; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, 3.6 million; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, 2.9 million; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, 2.7 million; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, 2.6 million; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, 2.4 million; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, 2.3 million; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, 2.3 million; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, 2.3 million; <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, 2.3 million; And <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, 2.3 million; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, 1.9 million; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, 1.9 million; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, 1.8 million; <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, 1.7 million; <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>, 1.5 million; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 1.5 million; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, 1.4 million; <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 1.3 million; Plus <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, 1.3 million; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, 1.3 million; <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 1.3 million; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 1.3 million; <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, 1.2 million; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, 1.2 million; <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, 1.1 million; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 1.1 million; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, 1.1 million and <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 1.1 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says 1988 grain shipments from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained of high quality even though drought cut yields. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, released Thursday, compared inspection records from 1988 and previous years for wheat, corn, soybeans and other grains. The report said wheat moisture decreased or remained the same for all lots, except hard red spring wheat. For hard red spring wheat, the average moisture was 11.9 percent, up from 11.8 percent in 1987. Wheat represented 36 percent of the total 115.7 million metric tons of grains and oilseeds exported in 1988. Nearly half the 42 million metric tons of exported wheat was hard red winter wheat; 19 percent white wheat; 15 percent hard red spring wheat; 14 percent soft winter wheat; 2 percent durum; and less than 1 percent mixed wheat. The report said corn moisture and the amount of damaged kernels decreased, but there was a small increase reported in broken corn and the presence of foreign material. Corn represented 40.7 percent of the total metric tons of grains and oilseeds exported in 1988. Except for a fraction, almost all was yellow corn. Soybeans showed an increase in test weight and a decrease in amount of damaged kernels, but an increase in the amount of foreign material and split soybeans. Soybeans accounted for 15.7 percent of total exports of grains and oilseeds in 1988, the report said. The other products are sorghum, barley, sunflower seeds, rye, flaxseed and oats.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has issued its first permit for the use of genetically altered trees under the notion that what's sauce for the potato is sauce for the poplar. The department said the permit, announced last week, will enable investigators at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION> to study a natural plant defense mechanism that has been transferred from the potato. Twenty poplar trees, cloned for uniformity, will be tested to see if the defense mechanism is `` switched on'' when the trees are threatened by insects and other pests, thus saving plant energy when there is no threat. The genetically altered trees wo n't be allowed to bloom or produce seeds, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says.

 Americans cut back on their fresh fruit consumption in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. Per capita fruit consumption was estimated at 211.3 pounds in 1988, compared with the previous year's record of 214.3 pounds. `` Most of the decrease was attributed to reduced consumption of fresh fruit,'' the department said in its outlook and situation summary for fruit published this week.

<HEAD>SEC Files Complaint Against Penny Stock Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has filed a complaint charging two companies and 14 people with running a penny stock scam that bilked investors of at least $ 10 million. The complaint, filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, alleges the defendants secretly controlled the stock of the two companies and artificially raised the share price before selling at large profits. When investors discovered that the companies had little or no real assets, `` they were left holding the bag,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, chief investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a injunctions against the two companies, <ORGANIZATION> GSS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Max </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the 14 persons named in the complaint for violating federal securities laws, <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. He refused to say whether other federal agencies were pursuing criminal charges against those named in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint. Buying and selling shares in the two companies _ which were not listed on any exchange _ effectively ended after the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> suspended trading for ten days in June 1987, <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GSS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> listed <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as its headquarters, although it was previously based in Ft.. <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Max </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> gave <LOCATION> Orem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, as its headquarters, <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said There were no telephone listings for either company. He said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also filed a motion to freeze the assets of the companies and the alleged ringleaders of the operation: <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmes </PERSON>, of Rancho <PERSON> Palos </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> is being held by authorities in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for his alleged involvement in fraudulent business deals in that country, <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint alleges that the two companies were created by <PERSON> Kimmes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and others involved in the scheme. The complaint charges them with secretly buying the stock in an initial offering and then artificially boosting the price through such fraudulent means as announcing impending mergers that never happened, <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. They also allegedly coordinated the buying and selling of shares to investors at huge profits, he said. Before trading in both companies was suspended, <PERSON> Max </PERSON>'s stock climbed from an original price of 15 cents per share in 1985 to a high of $ 6 per share, while stock in <ORGANIZATION> GSS </ORGANIZATION> rose from an initial share price of 15 cents in 1986 to more than $ 3, <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. Investors around the country who heard about the companies through news releases that the firms put out invested more than $ 10 million in both companies only to find their shares were worthless, he added. Others named in the complaint are: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmes </PERSON>' son, <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Condie </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Springville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matzner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woodmere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Denoble </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Eloise </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Graff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Orem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 Prosecutors say losses suffered by victims of the illegal schemes that resulted in charges against traders at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s futures markets were significant, but at least two investors expressed surprise to learn they had been bilked. The exchanges, meanwhile, still feeling the sting of indictments against 46 traders Wednesday, took steps to implement tougher rules and penalties and increase scrutiny of the trading floor. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the measures were intended `` to put the fear of God into the membership.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> took out full-page ads in today's editions of several newspapers, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> In them, the exchange promises to investigate all reports of wrongdoing and take disciplinary action against those found guilty. And the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that more than 100 additional traders will be indicted this year as a result of the investigation, according to unnamed defense and government sources. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Neisler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, identified in the indictments as one of the customers victimized by the illegal trading practices, said Thursday, `` I do n't know what to make of the whole thing.'' <PERSON> Neisler </PERSON> said he has used the futures markets for nearly 20 years as a hedge against his investment in the soybean crop he grows on part of a 1,500-acre family farm. `` I do n't suppose I'll know how much is gone until this goes through trial,'' <PERSON> Neisler </PERSON> said. `` But it's like somebody telling you that you got gypped when you bought clothes at the department store not too long ago, and not telling you much else,'' he said. `` You do n't know how much, you do n't why, you just know you've been gypped. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlikas </PERSON>, another investor identified in the indictments, said he lost $ 6,000 in a year and had heard talk of illegal trading activities from friends at the Board of Trade. `` I'd heard rumors, but I traded through a reputable company and I did n't figure this would touch me,'' said <PERSON> Gerlikas </PERSON>, a 31-year-old who runs a string of small businesses from his home in the northwest <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Palatine </LOCATION>. `` Looking back now, I have no real way of knowing how much, if any, of the $ 6,000 was taken through illegal trades.'' <PERSON> Gerlikas </PERSON> said, however, he might return to the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> in the future. `` There'll always be dishonesty,'' he said, `` but I've got a feeling they're going to clean things up this time around.'' Both exchanges sought to get started with the cleanup Thursday. `` The integrity of the markets and public confidence in them is our highest priority,'' <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, said at a news conference `` If we falter in this responsibility, we will lose the right of self-regulation.'' Trading practices in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> markets have come under severe scrutiny from federal regulators and politicians since the disclosure earlier this year of the 2 -LCB- - year federal undercover investigation that led to the indictments Rule changes enacted and proposed by the markets _ which for the most part regulate their own trading practices _ appear to be aimed not only at cracking down on wrongdoing but also heading off possibly tougher restrictions by lawmakers and regulators. One new rule adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> calls for automatic expulsion of any trader found guilty of a second offense involving a customer's account. `` That's what we meant by putting the fear of God into the membership,'' said <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>. But the most significant rule change approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> requires membership approval It would severely limit dual trading, in which a trader is allowed to trade on his own account as well as those of customers. That practice made possible many of the frauds alleged in the indictments: pre-arranged trades; order crossing, in which a trader crosses buy and sell orders rather than bring them to the competitive auction process of the pit; and front-running, where a trader trades on his own account in advance of a large customer order, knowing the price of a commodity will rise or fall because of the order following it. The Board of Trade issued a similar response late Wednesday, proposing tougher regulations, penalties and surveillance measures. The indictments accused traders of systematically conspiring to skim profits from customer accounts and attempting to hide earnings from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In announcing the indictments, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> called the amount customers may have lost by fraud `` significant,'' but declined to specify the amount. Brokers trading for their own accounts as well as customers' accounts were alleged to have routinely and illegally cheated customers with the cooperation of `` locals'' _ traders who traded only for their own accounts Eighteen of the defendants were charged with violating the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations act, which carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison. The law also empowers the government to freeze defendants' assets before trial for seizure upon conviction. Fourteen of those charged already have agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with investigators, according to government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 French oil giant <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION> has ended its $ 132-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> after purchasing 96 percent of the outstanding shares. Thursday's move comes three days after the companies reached an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that will permit the completion of the $ 1.05 billion acquisition. <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> plans to merge <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, a pharmaceutical company, with <ORGANIZATION> AC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, the companies said in a statement Thursday. Under the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> must sell a 4-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Thorofare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where two chemicals _ polyvinylidene flouride and vinylidene flouride _ are produced. The company will be allowed to keep a <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Calvert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, which produces the same chemicals. The chemicals, which <PERSON> Elf </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquitaine </PERSON> also produces, are used to coat electrical wires, to line pipes in chemical plants and to coat buildings. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, which reviews takeovers for possible violations of antitrust laws, originally planned to seek a court order preventing the combination because it `` could substantially reduce competition in the production and the sale'' of the two chemicals. In March, Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s management accepted the offer from <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION>, an energy and chemical company owned largely by the French government. Elf's bid won out over a hostile attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment group. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 131.87 -LCB-, up 12 -LCB- cents.

 Convincing Mexicans to keep their savings inside the country is essential for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economic recovery, says President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> inaugurated the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meeting </ORGANIZATION> here Thursday with a plea to bankers to `` improve the quality of attention that customers receive.'' Increasing savings and providing credit to lower income groups `` is part of your responsibility,'' he told bankers. During the past few months Mexicans brought back $ 2.3 billion deposited in foreign banks, helping to boost the country's foreign reserves to $ 6 billion, said <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancera </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, the country's central bank. <PERSON> Mancera </PERSON> told the nearly 1,500 banking and government officials from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries that the first half of 1989 saw an `` abundant repatriation, lured by high interest rates.'' It is estimated that Mexicans have $ 28 billion in foreign banks, mostly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. To entice more people to bring back deposits, the government announced this week a plan to only minimally tax repatriated funds. `` We Mexicans must finance our own development. We can accomplish that by saving more and increasing income to the country through exports of manufactured products,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mancera </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s balance of payments showed a $ 585 million deficit through July, which he called `` relatively modest considering the circumstances.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> paid out $ 600 million to service its public debt and $ 700 million on private debt service, he said. During the same period, <PERSON> Mancera </PERSON> said, net foreign direct investments totaled $ 900 million. The two-day meeting, held for the second consecutive year in this northern industrial capital, follows a July 23 accord between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and private bank creditors to restructure $ 54 billion of its $ 107 billion foreign debt.

Like most credit cards, these have restrictions. Youngsters must talk a parent or other adult into co-signing and guaranteeing payment on their accounts.

<HEAD>Market Leaves Auto Stocks Behind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While many other stocks have reached or approached new highs of late, shares of the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto manufacturers have faced trouble getting into gear. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, traded late last week around $ 50, down from the peak of $ 56.75 it reached early this year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in the neighborhood of $ 24, is going for barely half its 1987 high of $ 48. And <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, even with a recent spurt from the low $ 40s to $ 45, remains short of its early-1989 high of $ 47.37. The group's laggard behavior is no puzzle to followers of the industry's fortunes. Car sales have been weak for some time now, and production plans have been cut repeatedly for the remainder of the year. Indeed, when Wall Street economists argue that the economy is headed for a recession, the state of the auto industry is usually one of the first pieces of evidence they cite. `` The weakness in the auto market has been quite obvious for months in disappointing car sales,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON>, an analyst who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` As a result, the earnings of the Big Three will begin to reflect the strain.'' Some observers say the industry is paying a price for the marketing innovations that helped sell so many cars from the mid-1980s through last year _ sales incentives such as rebates and cut-rate financing, and auto loans stretching out for periods as long as five years. When consumers go shopping to replace cars bought with four - or five-year loans, they often find themselves with little equity in them to use toward a down payment on a new vehicle `` Incentives are now the bane of every automaker selling cars in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> says. `` Automakers have discovered that while they can no longer sell cars without some type of incentive, this year they are learning that they ca n't even sell cars with incentives.'' Those problems aside, many analysts argue that the industry was due for an inevitable down stage in its business cycle. The long-term trend is for growth of the American car and truck fleet at about 1.3 percent a year, the Value Line Investment Survey says in its latest quarterly report on the industry. From 1984 through 1988, the advisory service says, sales of vehicles surpassed that level, using up a lot of demand. `` We expect that unit sales comparisons will be negative through most of 1989,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. All that does n't mean, however, that everyone on Wall Street is down on the auto stocks. `` Viewed from a long-term perspective,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said, `` industry fundamentals do n't look all that bad. `` The quality of domestically produced vehicles continues to rise and operating costs are being reduced, all of which should ultimately lift earnings.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Fricke </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, has just raised his ratings of the Big Three stocks. `` We think the stocks are already discounting a severe sales and earnings decline next year which we do n't think will happen,'' he said. `` The stocks tend to begin to outperform when the news background is bad, when interest rates have peaked and are headed down, and when a cyclical trough is in sight. Our call may be early, but we think the greater risk is missing the move up.'' Says <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON>: `` Although the outlook for the next year is not optimistic, we would be looking for an opportunity to buy these stocks.''

<TEXT>
 The federal government has yet to buy a single apple under its $ 15 million bailout of the Alar-plagued industry, but its emergency program is already a rousing success in the orchards. The market for apples has improved so dramatically in the past month that there is speculation there will not be a surplus even if the government fails to buy any apples. There could even be shortages. Retailers and industry officials credit the federal buyout plan announced July 7 with restoring consumer confidence in apples, which jumped 20 percent in sales and as much as 50 percent in wholesale price last month. `` The increase in sales is because of the added reassurance to the public,'' said <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, a chain of 342 food stores based in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The federal government is saying that apples are safe, and I think it has had an effect on consumers,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>, an administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the program. While the buyout already has had the desired effect of increasing sales and prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has no intention of halting planned purchases, <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` If we do n't go ahead, it would have an adverse effect on the marketplace, and we would certainly lose credibility with the industry,'' <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said. Recent statistics indicate the government's plan to purchase as many as 2 million 42-pound boxes of apples is unnecessary. In the past three weeks, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growers have shipped 2.7 million boxes of apples out of state. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> grows half the nation's apples but has about 90 percent of the remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warehouse supply. There were just 3.5 million boxes of apples left in the state's warehouses as of Aug. 1, and if sales continued at the same rate as in July, the entire surplus would be gone by the end of this month just as havesting of the 1989 crop begins But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said it is wrong to assume that sales will remain so hat high in August when there is considerable competition from other fruits. `` To expect that we could sell that volume in August would be fantasy land,'' said <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, noting such sales would break records for the month. The average sales in August for the past six years have been 1.9 million boxes, said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Yakima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers-Shippers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The industry became worried this summer when warehouse inventories climbed to twice the norm as concern over Alar depressed sales. Industry leaders aggressively pursued the federal apple purchase as a way to clean out warehouses and boost prices that had fallen below the cost of production. `` The market was headed for a black hole and this probably prevented it from going into the black hole,'' said <PERSON> Derl </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, which represents many of the 20,000 growers in the nation's $ 1 billion apple industry. Under the program, apples and apple juice will be shipped to charitable organizations, with the government reimbursing warehouses for the fruit. <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said 56 apple warehouses offered apples to the buyout program by Wednesday. Under the program, warehouses offer a certain number of apples and name a price. The government will not pay more than $ 8.20 per box. An announcement on exactly how many apples the government will buy and how much it will spend will come Tuesday, <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said. The industry's troubles were created by the Alar controversy that began in February when a consumer group said eating apples treated with the growth regulator increased cancer risk in children. That report by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has been disputed, but its impact on the market was undeniable. Prices for the top grade of red apples fell to $ 8 per box. But since the government announcement, they have risen to between $ 10 and $ 12 per box, prices well above the ceiling of $ 8.20 the government intends to pay.

<HEAD>Hoosier Finds Buckwheat a Hot Commodity Among Japanese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> has never visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but this year 75 percent of his income will come from growing buckwheat used to make Japanese pasta. Through a contract with a Japanese trading association, <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> directs the processing and shipment of Midwest-grown buckwheat, including a crop from his own farm in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. He is one of a small group of American brokers with contracts to produce buckwheat for the Japanese. His one-year deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Buckwheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to produce 22,000 acres in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> will pay him $ 9 per 100 pounds. It's a growing business. Last year, just 25 percent of his income came from buckwheat production. The Japanese consume about 250,000 tons of buckwheat a year, mostly in the form of a noodle called soba, a staple in their diet. Soba is made from a mixture of 30 percent to 50 percent buckwheat flour and hard red wheat flour. `` They tell me buckwheat flour has more protein, it's a sweeter flour and gives it an added flavor,'' <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> said in an interview on his farm near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, a rural community about 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> started growing buckwheat almost as an afterthought in 1981 when rain threatened to keep him from planting 600 acres of soybeans. `` I just thought we'd feed it to livestock if nothing else,'' he said. `` But we started marketing it to some flour mills.'' Buckwheat is an attractive crop to farmers because of its short growing time and ability to produce a better crop on poor soils, <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> said. Its white flowers bloom four to six weeks after planting in mid-July and the crop matures in about 10 weeks. A farmer's investment is typically $ 20 - $ 30 an acre, <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> `` We're not competing with any of the other crops,'' <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> said. `` Not only is it a profit to farmers, it enhances the soil the following year.'' As a protein source, nutritionists say, buckwheat is nearly unbeatable, and unlike other crops, it's mostly free of chemicals. Two-thirds of the buckwheat used in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is produced in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but the recent civil unrest there has caused the Japanese to search for alternate suppliers, <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, a large buckwheat producer, the government subsidizes freight costs, but the country's cold weather has hurt crops. `` The only reason we're getting it instead of them is because we have a lot less chance of losing a whole crop,'' <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> said. `` Down here, we're just about guaranteed of a crop every year. Since 1981, we've only had one year where we've had a total failure and we were delayed over 45 days at harvest.'' <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> expresses pride in his family run farm, which employs a handful of outsiders. A Rolex watch on his arm and a seldom-used pleasure boat in his yard are evidence of <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON>'s success. He said he wants to see buckwheat qualify for the federal export enhancement program, which provides support to make certain crops more competitive in foreign markets. `` We can be more competitive in price, still maintain a good price to our farmers and we'd probably be looking at 80,000 acres through the Corn Belt region,'' he said. <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> said he's been working with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Buckwheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the other American brokers to arrange a meeting with <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> to discuss export enhancement and crop insurance. `` We tell all of our growers how important it is to keep the buckwheat clean and free from other grains because if we want their business we have to maintain a high standard of quality,'' he said. End adv for Monday Aug. 7

 The nation's unemployment rate fell one notch to 5.2 percent in July as businesses added 169,000 new jobs despite the slowing economy, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the growth was again found predominantly in the service-producing sector of the economy, which added 140,000 of the new jobs. The civilian joblessness rate declined from the 5.3 percent reported for June. The government also revised its figures on new jobs created in June to 250,000, up sharply from the 180,000 reported last month. `` We have a soft economy but one that appears to have been stronger in July than in May and June,'' said chief economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This certainly should ease fears of imminent recession. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's top economic adviser, said the report `` suggests the economy is continuing to expand.'' He said the July job growth brought to 20 million the number of new jobs created during the record-long expansion, which began in late 1982. Today's report contained further evidence of persistent wage inflation. The department said hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers increased 0.8 percent in July _ about twice the rate analysts had predicted _ while average weekly earnings climbed by 1.7 percent. The jump in hourly earnings followed two months of modest increases. Goods-producing industries added 29,000 new positions as construction posted a gain of 35,000 jobs, helping to offset a decline of more than 10,000 jobs in the automobile industry. Manufacturing posted a modest gain of 3,000 jobs last month after three months of declines, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s survey of business establishments In all, 117.4 million Americans were at work in non-farm jobs last month, the government said. The average work week for production and nonsupervisory employees in private industry increased by 0.3 hours, to 34.9 hours. The factory work week held steady at 41 hours and overtime in July averaged 3.9 hours a week, up from 3.8 hours in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The jump in hourly earnings brought average hourly pay in the private sector to $ 9.70 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from $ 9.62 in June. Weekly earnings rose to an average of $ 338.53 from the June average of $ 332.85. The government said the summer expansion of the youth labor force in the past four months has totaled about 3.1 million, about the same as recent years despite a significant drop in the youth population. The unemployment rate fell last month despite a dip in the number of Americans at work from 117.5 million to 117.4 million. The rate fell because the 169,000 new jobs were created in a month in which the civilian labor force _ the number of people who have jobs or are looking for them _ fell by 146,000. Evidence of a number of recent economic developments could be found in today's unemployment report, the first comprehensive look at the economy's performance in July. The data showed employment in the mining industry fell by 11,000 jobs _ the result of a coal strike in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> that also has led to wildcat walkouts in other coal-producing states. The rebound in construction coincides with reports showing a upswing in housing starts and home sales. And the decline in auto manufacturing follows recent announcements by major automakers that they are cutting production bacause of sluggish sales. The 140,000 job growth in the service-producing sector came despite a 25,000 drop in the number of government jobs. Elsewhere in that sector, retail trade added 52,000 jobs, wholesale trade 5,000, transportation and public utilities 23,000 and finance, insurance and real estate 11,000. Employment in services was up by 74,000 positions and both business and health services posted modest gains, the government said. The payroll and wage data is taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s survey of businesses A separate household survey found few major shifts in unemployment among demographic groups, although joblessness among black teen-agers fell to 33.1 percent last month from 40.2 percent in June. The June total was up sharply from 28.4 percent in May. For white adult men, the unemployment rate was 3.8 percent last month, up from 3.7 percent in June. Among adult white women, the rate rose from 4.1 percent to 4.3 percent. Unemployment among white teen-agers was 13.4 percent, up from 12.6 percent in June. Among blacks, the overall jobless rate was 10.9 percent, down from 11.9 percent in June. Unemployment fell from 9.4 percent to 9.3 percent for adult black men and from 10.5 percent to 9.9 percent among black women. The government said 9 percent of Hispanics in the civilian labor force were unemployed in July, up from 8.1 percent in June. A separate calculation of unemployment that includes members of the armed services stationed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was also 5.2 percent in July, unchanged from June.

 J.H. <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, under pressure from its bankers, today cut its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by $ 74 million to $ 1.18 billion, and Prime accepted the new offer. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> venture capital firm said it will pay $ 20 a share for the outstanding common stock of Natick-based Prime, down from its previous offer of $ 21.50 a share. After Prime reported a $ 19 million quarterly loss last week, <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> came under pressure from its main financing sources _ <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> _ to line up additional funds to ensure that it could ride out a period of continued losses. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said Thursday it had been unable to obtain the additional financing at $ 21.50 per share and was entering negotiations with Prime to reduce the offer. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> partner, said today <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> has informed Prime that `` our financing sources have furnished us financing commitments at $ 20 per share.'' In a statement, Prime Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said, `` The board of directors of Prime is very disappointed that J.H. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and its financial sources have not completed the $ 21.50 per share offer agreed to in the original merger agreement.'' However, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said, the board believed the amended <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> offer remained economically superior to a competing offer from <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and recommended that Prime shareholders accept it. Prime, a manufacturer of minicomputers and computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, last month agreed to merge with <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> while fending off the hostile bid from MAI. MAI, a computer firm controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, had originally offered $ 20 a share for Prime but cut its offer on June 1 to $ 19.50 a share. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s new offer of $ 20 a share applies to Prime's 49.5 million outstanding common shares, which represent about 79 percent of the company's stock on a fully-diluted basis. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> has offered to exchange securities with a face value of $ 22 per share for the remaining 21 percent of Prime's shares.

 Call it the latest summer brownout. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> suits are making a fresh appearance this year, minus the two-tone shoes and natty hats, spats and cravats that your grandfather wore with them. Clothiers say the modern brown suit is subtler than its ancestor and usually has a strong tinge of blue or gray, the official colors of the corporate office. About 5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schaffner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>'s men's suits this year are in brown or olive shades and that share could double in 1990, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, executive vice president. Last year, <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said, sales were `` minuscule.'' Similar increases are being posted by <ORGANIZATION> Greif </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, whose suit lines include <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and Chaps by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Feiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Cricketeer suits. Theories for the trend range from the influence of European fashion to nostalgia for military uniforms to attempts by the clothing industry to drum up sales with a new look. Chocolate brown suits are still very out, despite a blip in sales after <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wore them. What's in is taupe, a chameleon-like brownish gray that can range from pale to charcoal, from reddish to bluish to greenish. `` <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is coming back,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallack </PERSON>, a clothier to the stars in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, whose clients include talk show host <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON>. `` Basically brown's never been an important color in this country. But taupe, with off shades of different colorations, that could be big, if the retailer gets behind it,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bier </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Greif </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>. Clothing manufacturers are disarmingly frank about their attempts to engineer interest in browns and olives to increase sales. `` We're trying to stimulate the business by obsoleting last year's designs,'' said <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schaffner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriber </PERSON> was spotted recently on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s fashionable 57th Street wearing a good-looking suit `` I would say it has a brown cast with blue influence,'' said <PERSON> Moriber </PERSON>, creative director of a public relations agency. `` I like it because it has a subtle pattern. It can go either way. It has blue tones as well as warm tones.'' Dressing advice books say a man in a brown suit wo n't be taken seriously, but taupe may be another matter. Its peculiar beauty is that no one can quite describe it. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s Third New International Dictionary says taupe comes from the Latin talpa, for mole, and calls it `` a brownish gray that is paler and slightly yellower than chocolate, duller and slightly redder than mouse gray, and duller and slightly redder than castor.'' `` We started seeing it about five years ago,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a salesman at The Tailored Man in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It can have a green cast or an olive cast or a purple cast. ... It's hard to define.'' For fall and winter, taupe will carry on in its darker tones, as a thread or accent color in a pinstripe, windowpane or subtle plaid suit, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Julian </PERSON>, associate fashion director of the Men's <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> Europeans have always used a bigger palette of colors in men's suits, and that influence is crossing the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> But the most interesting theory on the popularity of brown and olive is the military one. `` Men get a little leery of wearing things like taupes and olives when they just get out of the military. Right after World War II or the Korean conflict or the Vietnam War you could n't give away colors like that,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, vice president for communications at <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Feiss </PERSON>. Now that the nation has been at peace for some time, the bad feelings are gone, she said. `` There may even be some nostalgia.'' Still, navy and gray are entrenched. `` You ca n't push a man that quickly,'' said <PERSON> Bier </PERSON> of <PERSON> Greif </PERSON> Cos. `` He's not in the same category as women. We only made that mistake once in our business and that's with the Nehru jacket.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today endorsed a compromise on his $ 159 billion savings and loan bailout, lifting a veto threat after <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and congressional negotiators struck a deal in a late-night bargaining session. `` This legislation has been developed in a bipartisan process. It is badly needed, and must be enacted without further delay,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a letter to congressional leaders. `` I ask that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approve this legislation today.'' House leaders scrambled to muster enough Republican votes to compensate for defecting Democrats unhappy with the pact. Opposing the deal were three influential committee chairmen, Reps. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., of the The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> planned to vote on the deal first, with leaders expecting passage by a wide margin. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said despite opposition within his own party he was pushing for enactment in time to allow <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to leave for its summer vacation at the end of the day `` I think this bill needs to be passed,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` This is a compromise that we did n't prefer to make, but because the president has been adamant ... we had to deal with that.'' Aides said they had collected signatures from 28 of the 55 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegates to a conference committee that worked out the compromise late Thursday night with help from <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. That was just enough to move the plan to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, but there were other procedural hurdles to be overcome before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could act today. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said the compromise plan for financing the bailout will cost more than the method originally proposed by Democrats. But, he added, `` If we delay it or defeat it, that will cost money.'' The compromise would cost each American taxpayer an average total of $ 1,000 over 30 years. The administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> long ago agreed on the most important elements of the landmark bill, which will close or merge hundreds of insolvent savings institutions hemorrhaging losses at an estimated $ 20 million a day. It also contains a series of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> labeled `` never again'' provisions designed to prevent the recurrence of what analysts describe as the worst financial crisis since the wave of bank failures in the 1930s. In the key reform, savings and loan owners will be required to raise billions of dollars of their own capital to discourage risky investments and act as a cushion between future losses and government deposit insurance funds. Thrift institutions will be channeled back into home mortgage lending and away from speculative commercial real estate ventures and high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. The bill also gives the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> $ 75 million a year to root out fraud at financial institutions, permits banks for the first time to buy healthy institutions in the rival thrift industry, and enacts the most sweeping restructuring of the regulatory bureaucracy in five decades. The agency overseeing S & amp; Ls, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, will be dismantled, with one piece wrapped into the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the other coming under the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures commercial bank deposits. While taxpayers will bear most of the bailout, the savings industry also is contributing through higher deposit insurance premiums. A dispute between the White House and congressional Democrats over how to account for the taxpayer funds was the last snag. Shrugging off a morning veto threat, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at midday Thursday voted 221-199 to approve the legislation with its own financing plan. But by evening, the bill bogged down in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Senators voted 54-46 in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> financing proposal, but fell six votes short of the 60-vote majority required under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. That sent the bill to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference, which after 2 -LCB- hours of talks endorsed a compromise offered by four of the five <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delegates. Thursday night's compromise was a hybrid of two conflicting plans to evade automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. Democrats wanted to avoid the cuts by waiving the law. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would have borrowed rescue money through a private agency, keeping the spending out of the budget. The compromise calls for raising $ 20 billion this year along the lines Democrats had suggested, ballooning the 1989 deficit from an estimated $ 148 billion to $ 168 billion, the highest in three years. However, spending cuts would not be triggered because the deadline for meeting spending targets has passed. The remaining $ 30 billion would be borrowed `` off-budget'' in 1990 and 1991 as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted and will not show up in the deficit. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> questioned whether regulators could spend $ 20 billion before the end of the 1989 fiscal year on Sept. 30, but he called the compromise `` conceptually sound.''

 The stock market pulled back today, responding to a stronger-than-expected report on the employment situation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.76 to 2,649.85 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 566 up, 911 down and 488 unchanged. Before the opening the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the civilian unemployment rate dropped to 5.2 percent in July from 5.3 percent the month before. Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 169,000, on top of an upward-revised 250,000 gain in June. The figures were interpreted as evidence of persistent strength in the economy, suggesting that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might see little need to relax its credit policy further any time soon. Interest rates jumped in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds fell more than $ 15 for each $ 1,000 in face value, pushing their yields back above 8 percent. The reaction in the stock market was less clear-cut, however. While the news was a negative for interest rates, brokers said, it also helped to ease recent worries about a possible recession. <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> fell 4 -RRB- to 116 | after climbing 6 -RRB- points Thursday Some analysts expressed skepticism about recent takeover talk involving the company.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, rebounding from a week-long string of losses as traders evened up their positions ahead of the weekend. Grain futures also advanced, partly in sympathy with soybeans and partly in reaction to a private crop-production estimate pegging the 1989 corn and soybean harvests slightly below the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest projections. Soybeans for delivery in August had fallen a total of more than 85 cents a bushel in the five previous sessions as growing conditions improved and supplies of newly harvested South American soybeans increased. `` This rally was long overdue,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The market was oversold technically and it was just a matter of which day it would fall on.'' He said many traders typically even up their positions on Friday so they have no risk exposure over the weekend. Some of those who had sold at higher prices earlier in the week may have been buyers on Friday. Another bullish factor was a report Thursday on crop production estimates by <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private analytical firm based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. A financial news service reported that <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> had pegged the 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean harvest at 1.9 billion bushels and the corn crop at 7.3 billion bushels <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> would not confirm the report. Both reported estimates were slightly below the Agriculture Department's latest predictions. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> will issue new harvest projections in a crop report due out on Thursday. At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with September at $ 3.87 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.19 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 1.40 \ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 16 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 5.91 a

 Pro football Hall of <PERSON> Famer </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Staubach </PERSON> has joined the lineup of those backing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strikers, writing a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saying that continued sales of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets could bring the airline's eventual demise. In a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dated Aug. 1, the former <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> quarterback asked that a meeting be set up as soon as possible between representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s domestic policy adviser. <PERSON> Staubach </PERSON> wrote that his interest in the airline stemmed from personal relationships with many striking Eastern pilots. He said that group includes the best man at his wedding, football teammates and classmates at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy, where <PERSON> Staubach </PERSON> also was a quarterback. From his conversations with those friends and from `` all other accounts,'' <PERSON> Staubach </PERSON> wrote, `` it is obvious that the Eastern situation is far more than a traditional labor-management dispute. It goes to the very root of the free enterprise system within our country.'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said he had no comment on <PERSON> Staubach </PERSON>'s letter or speculation that the former football player might get involved in making a buyout offer for the company. Staubach, who now runs a commercial real estate company in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, did n't return a call seeking comment Friday. It was n't immediately clear whether <PERSON> Staubach </PERSON>'s interest in Eastern could extend to a possible bid for the crippled airline Another sports figure, former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, made a buyout bid for Eastern in partnership with the unions in early April. But the takeover agreement between <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, later fell apart over the unions' demand that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> be removed from daily control of the airline. Eastern pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members and flight attendants are in the sixth month of a strike against the Miami-based company, which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors since March 9. The company is reorganizing as a smaller carrier, selling $ 1.8 billion in aircraft, landing slots and other assets, and hiring new pilots to replace the strikers. Eastern's unions support an alternative buyout proposal by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman who has met at the White House with high-level members of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. On Thursday, the master executive council of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union passed a resolution calling for pilots at carriers nationwide to undertake a temporary work stoppage to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s fitness to run <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its sister carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

 The dollar rose nearly 2 percent Friday against major foreign currencies, its biggest gain in months, after a government report upset expectations of an economic slowdown. The dollar's rally was the mirror image of a debacle in the bond market. The selling binge in bonds drove interest yields higher and made the dollar-denominated securities more attractive to global investors. Gold prices fell in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after finishing higher overseas. The dollar remained well below the peaks reached in June in spite of its one-day surge, which amounted to 1.9 percent against the West German mark, British pound and Japanese yen and an even 2 percent vs. the Swiss franc. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> triggered the rally by announcing that nonfarm payrolls rose by 169,000 in July. Although the figure was consistent with economists' predictions, many traders had been betting that payroll growth would be much smaller. Also, the department revised upward the figure for June job growth. The job statistics renewed fears of inflation, which hurts the value of interest-paying securities. As a result bond prices fell and their yields shot up. The higher yields on bonds and short-term securities attracted money into dollars, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. Also helping the dollar was heightened tension in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The dollar widely is seen as a safe haven from political turmoil. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 138.05 yen, up 1.65 yen from Thursday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 139.40 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar rose to 139.85 yen from 137.20 yen late Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar jumped against the British pound, with sterling falling to $ 1.6150 from $ 1.6475 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound fell to $ 1.6060 from $ 1.6373. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.9070 West German marks, up from 1.8718; 1.6435 Swiss francs, up from 1.6115; 1.1783 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1733; 6.4555 French francs, up from 6.3395; and 1,370.50 Italian lire, up from 1,348.50. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.8975 West German marks, up from 1.8650; 1.6353 Swiss francs, up from 1.6065; 6.4260 French francs, up from 6.3192; 2.1300 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0950; 1,366.00 Italian lire, up from 1,338.00, and 1.1775 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1715. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 372.86 a troy ounce, up $ 2.19 from Thursday. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 370.75 a troy ounce, from $ 369.75 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to close at a bid of $ 370.50 from $ 369.50 an ounce Thursday. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 367.25 an ounce from $ 373.30. Later, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 367.50, down from $ 372.25. Silver bullion prices held steady on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, where the metal was trading at a late bid of $ 5.23 a troy ounce, unchanged from Thursday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 5.168 from $ 5.296 on Thursday.

 Crude oil futures sank lower Friday but the near-month contract failed to pierce the $ 18 level on the way down.

The contract traded at a low of $ 18 during the session. Contracts for delivery in October and November were down 21 cents each to $ 17.70 and $ 17.66 respectively. Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline for September fell 0.42 cent to 50.24 cents a gallon, while other contracts closed mixed. Heating oil for September delivery edged up 0.6 cent to close at 49.18 cents a gallon. Most other contract months were lower. Traders said volume was extremely light in an uneventful session. `` There was not a lot going on,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, energy broker for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

Weak gasoline prices due to excess refinery output and an increase in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production have softened crude prices in recent weeks.

 Boise-based <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knudsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has entered into a joint venture with a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> company to develop a gold mine in southeastern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> MK </LOCATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> announced. MK said Friday it will enter into an equal partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Eastmaque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> to own, develop and operate the American Girl gold mine now held by <PERSON> Eastmaque </PERSON>. MK will purchase 500,000 common shares from Eastmaque for $ 5 per share <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, contribute $ 10 million to the venture and assume certain obligations. `` By acquiring an equity position in a productive gold mine we have advanced a key goal in our mining strategy. Our owner's position is a sensible expansion in an industry we know well through 40 years' experience as a contract miner,'' <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> said The mine currently produces 2,000 ounces of gold per month. With improvements made this summer, it could increase the yield to about 3,200 ounces a month. When the mine is in full production next May, it should come up with 6,000 ounces of gold each month, MK said. MK is an international engineering, mining and construction company with 15,000 employees and annual revenue of about $ 2 billion.

<HEAD>Younger Gallo Denied Re-Trial In Trademark Dispute With Brothers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The younger brother of winemaking giants <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> has been denied a new trial in a trademark dispute that bars him from using the <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> name to sell cheese. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> ruled Friday that his association with a law firm that once represented the Gallo Winery is not a conflict of interest, and that there is insufficient evidence to warrant a new trial. The elder <PERSON> Gallos </PERSON> sued the brother they raised after he began using the family name to sell cheese in the mid 1980s. In his June 20 ruling, <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> use of his full name as a trademark because consumers confused it with the famous E & amp; J Gallo Winery. The ruling allows <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> to use his name as a signature or in block letters if the label contains a prominent trademark without the <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> name. A lawyer for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanny </PERSON>, argued in the retrial motion that his client did n't get a fair trial because <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>'s law firm represented <ORGANIZATION> Gallo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winery </ORGANIZATION> in a 1983 trademark dispute with <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salame </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> wrote in the decision that lawyers representing <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> knew of his association with the law firm, and had n't objected when he was assigned the <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> cheese case <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> said he does n't remember the earlier case, which was settled before he became a district judge. <PERSON> Yanny </PERSON> also argued that the original ruling denied <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> his freedom of `` commercial speech'' as protected by the First Amendment. But <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> ruled that those arguments had been covered in the trial.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> signed the acquisition papers Friday to complete his group's $ 3.65 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The 41-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> treasurer said all publicly held shares of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> common stock have been purchased for $ 121 each, officially ending the takeover battle initiated by <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> in late March. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> has said he will spend some of his time at <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, headquarters but will not take a management position. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> will stay on as the company's chief executive officer and chairman while <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> will become a board member, a spokesman for the airline said. As a result of the takeover, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday it has lowered the senior debt ratings of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to Single-B1 from BAA2, and of <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to BA2 from Single-A3. About $ 400 million of long-term debt is affected, the credit rating agency said. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s group, described early on by <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> as a friendly suitor, beat out at least three other bidders: rival airline <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; the 20,000-member Machinists union local at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>; and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> oil billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who started the public bidding with an offer of $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90 a share, on March 28. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, who once worked for the Bass brothers of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, financed the takeover with $ 700 million cash and another $ 3.35 billion in financing from commercial banks led by <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Equity partners include <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, neither of which are allowed a controlling interest under laws that limit foreign investment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines The deal did not require government approval, but <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s group will need an operating permit from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is conducting a financial fitness review of the new owners <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> has said it is `` laughable'' to think that the permit would be withheld. He acquires an airline in the midst of tense contract talks with its 5,000 pilots. The pilots have been without a contract for about 2 -LCB- years and have asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to declare an impasse in the negotiations. If the request is granted, the pilots would be free to strike legally after a 30-day `` cooling-off'' period. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> is depending on a steady cash flow to service the large takeover debt and a pilots' strike could idle the carrier. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> also inherits an airline that earned the nickname `` Northworst'' after a prolonged performance slump that followed the 1986 purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The carrier has vastly improved its service, however, and earnings are on the rise. After posting record earnings in 1988 of $ 135 million, or $ 4.63 a share, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> is positioned to surpass that mark. It earned $ 83.3 million, or $ 2.82 a share, in the first six months of this year. Of the 21.2 billion revenue passenger miles logged by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 314 planes in the first six months of the year, 12.6 billion miles were domestic and 7.3 billion were flown on routes to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> has the largest presence of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier. A revenue passenger mile represents one paying passenger flown one mile. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> has vowed to keep the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> suburb minutes from the Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> International </PERSON> <PERSON> Airport </PERSON>, and he has said the jobs of the carrier's 37,590 employees are secure

 There's no telling how many people will be indicted as a result of the ongoing federal probe into fraudulent trading at the world's largest futures exchanges, but it could be as many as 200, a defense lawyer said Friday. Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, asked about a published report saying the next few months could bring an additional 100 indictments, said the government could seek many more than that _ or less. `` It could be as many as they want,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who represents an indicted trader. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>' office did not immediately return telephone calls, but his office has consistently declined comment about the breadth of the investigation into trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` They could potentially indict anybody who ever put a -LRB- trading -RRB- jacket on'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Durkin </PERSON>, referring to minor violations. `` I think it will go on for a couple of years.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions that more than 100 additional indictments are expected this fall, with charges ranging from minor infractions to major violations like those already charged. Meanwhile, 25 of the 46 traders indicted Wednesday were expected to cooperate with federal authorities in meetings next week, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions. A handful of traders had been cooperating for months, and 14 have agreed to plead guilty and help investigators, federal sources have said. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said whether people decided to cooperate likely would be a matter of personal character, the strength of evidence against them, and whether they had information that was valuable to authorities. `` It's a matter of selling something valuable,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` You've got to sell something to get something,'' he said. `` Some people as a matter of principle would n't even tell the truth to the government. Others would lie on their mothers to get out of it.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said his client, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashman </PERSON>, would not cooperate. <PERSON> Ashman </PERSON> was indicted on one count of conspiracy under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, 13 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act and one count of making false statements to a government agent. The indictments capped a 2 -LCB- - year undercover investigation in which at least four <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posed as traders at the two exchanges Pleas were scheduled Wednesday from 21 of those indicted before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovich </PERSON>, who was assigned cases involving the Japanese yen pit. The 19 soybean-pit defendants were to be arraigned Aug. 25 before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Three more traders were indicted for alleged activities in the bond pit, and three others were accused of wrongdoing in the Swiss franc pit. In the indictments, traders were accused of systematically conspiring to skim profits from customer accounts and attempting to hide earnings from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Brokers trading for their own accounts as well as customers' accounts, a practice called dual trading, were alleged to have routinely and illegally cheated customers with the cooperation of `` locals,'' or traders who traded only for their own accounts Eighteen of the defendants charged Wednesday are accused of violations of the RICO act, which carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison. RICO empowers the government to freeze defendants' assets before trial and to seize them upon conviction if they are found to have been acquired through illegal means. But the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted government sources as saying prosecutors would not try to seize defendants' homes.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Plunge on Employment Report</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices took their biggest dive in about 22 months Friday as a stronger-than-expected employment report jolted a market already bracing for a heavy supply of new <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues to be auctioned next week. The yield of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond rose above 8 percent, just a week after it finished the session below that level for the first time in more than two years. The bond's price fell 2 -LRB- points, or more than $ 21 per $ 1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, leaped to 8.07 percent from 7.90 percent late Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, dropped 12.67 to 1,188.13. That was the biggest one-day decline in that index since it fell 13.08 on Oct. 14, 1987 _ five days before the stock market crash. The trigger for the big price decline was the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on Friday morning that businesses added 169,000 jobs in July as the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent In addition, the government revised upward its original estimate of job growth in June to 250,000 from 180,000. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said the job creation numbers indicated the economy has more resilience than some economists have expected. `` It really brought the sellers out,'' he said. In recent days, <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said, the perception had been growing that the economy was slowing markedly and that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may have to loosen its credit policy to avoid a recession. But with the economy still expanding, he said, bond traders are now betting that the central bank will leave its policy unchanged for awhile. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said he does n't `` buy the argument that the employment report was that strong.'' He said the market is more concerned about absorbing the $ 29.5 billion in new securities that the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> plans to auction next week. In addition, he said, the market is wary about the new supply of issues that may be headed its way as a result of a compromise between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a rescue package for the nation's savings and loans. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments fell | point to a full point, intermediate maturities lost 1 -LRB- point to 1 -LCB- points, and long-term issues fell as much as 2 -LRB- points, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. In corporate trading, industrials fell. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, lost 4.20 to 331.10. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds dropped 7-16 point. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.20 percent from 7.16 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.11 percent as the discount jumped 22 basis points to 7.85 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.11 percent as the discount rose 27 basis points to 7.70 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.05 percent as the discount rose 33 basis points to 7.50 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 8 ~ percent, unchanged from late Thursday

 Gold and silver futures prices fell sharply Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar surged in value against other major currencies in reaction to the government's report on July unemployment On other markets, the major agricultural commodities were higher while energy futures prices were mostly lower. Gold futures settled $ 5.40 to $ 6 lower with August at $ 367.80 a troy ounce; silver was 12.2 cents to 13.3 cents lower with September at $ 5.20 a troy ounce. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a 5.2 percent jobless rate in July fell within the market's expectations and was considered neutral for the financial markets, analysts said. But the agency's revision of the June non-farm payroll number, showing a gain of 250,000 jobs instead of 180,000, indicated the economy was healthier than had previously been believed. `` That revision obviously pointed toward the fact that while the economy has slowed down significantly, it certainly is not pointing toward an imminent recession,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Either way, it means economic conditions do not favor metals,'' he said. `` They'll have to look to the dollar for direction.'' The dollar skyrocketed and interest rates jumped in response to the report, prompting a shift of investment dollars from the precious metals to interest-bearing instruments. Soybean futures prices posted strong gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, rebounding from a weeklong string of losses as traders evened up their positions ahead of the weekend. Grain futures also advanced, partly in tandem with soybeans and partly in reaction to a private crop-production estimate pegging the 1989 corn and soybean harvests slightly below <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> projections. Soybeans for delivery in August had fallen a total of more than 85 cents a bushel in the five previous sessions as growing conditions improved and supplies of newly harvested South American soybeans increased. `` This rally was long overdue,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The market was oversold technically and it was just a matter of which day it would fall on.'' Wheat settled -RCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with September at $ 3.87 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.19 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 1.40 \ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 16 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 5.90 -RCB- a bushel Most live cattle futures climbed on buying spurred by strong cash markets. Higher cash hog prices supported the pork complex. Live cattle settled .20 cent to .62 cent higher with August at 74.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .43 cent higher with August at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent to .90 cent higher with August at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .65 cent to 1.28 cents higher with August at 26.27 cents a pound. Crude oil futures sank on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but the near-month contract failed to pierce $ 18 a barrel. Traders said volume was extremely light in an uneventful session. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 21 cents lower with September at $ 18.03 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent lower to .06 cent higher with September at 49.18 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .43 cent lower to .10 cent higher with September at 51.24 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
 In the wake of three consecutive quarterly losses, <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reluctantly recommended that its shareholders accept a buyout by J.H. <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 1.1 billion, $ 74 million less than <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s previous offer. Prime's board of directors said the merger was still preferable to selling its minicomputer business to <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which has offered $ 525 million for the division. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> venture capital firm, said it would pay $ 20 a share for Prime's outstanding common stock, down from its previous offer of $ 21.50 a share or about $ 1.2 billion. The reduction in <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>'s offer was not as drastic as Wall Street had anticipated, and Prime's stock rose $ 1.12 -LCB- cents a share to close at $ 17.75 Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. An arbitrageur, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s original offer had been widely viewed as untenable, and the new offer was more realistic, raising traders' confidence that the deal would go through. `` The board of directors of Prime is very disappointed that J.H. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and its financial sources have not completed the $ 21.50 per share offer ...,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, Prime's chairman. `` However, after review of all the alternatives, the board of directors believes that the revised J.H. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> offer is the best economic alternative available for Prime stockholders,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said in a statement. Prime, which makes minicomputers and computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, turned a profit of $ 19 million on sales of $ 1.6 billion in 1988. But the cost of defending against a takeover and slow sales of minicomputers led to losses of $ 14.4 million in the final quarter of 1988, $ 5 million in the first quarter of this year and $ 19 million in the second quarter. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> emerged last month as a `` white knight,'' or friendly buyer, to save Prime from a hostile, $ 970 million bid by MAI Basic Four and its chairman, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> takeover specialist <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>. After Prime reported the most recent, $ 19 million loss last week, <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> came under pressure from its main financing sources _ <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> _ to line up an additional $ 50 million of financing to ensure that it could ride out a period of continued losses. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said Thursday it had been unable to obtain the additional financing at $ 21.50 per share and was entering negotiations with Prime to reduce the offer. The revised offer of $ 20 a share applies to Prime's 49.5 million outstanding common shares, which represent about 79 percent of the company's stock on a fully-diluted basis. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> has offered to exchange notes with a face value of $ 22 per share for the remaining 21 percent of Prime's shares. Securities analysts said those notes would trade at a substantial discount and estimated the total value of the deal at $ 17 to $ 18.50 a share, or $ 1.06 billion to $ 1.16 billion. Prime postponed its annual meeting from Aug. 9 to Aug. 24 to give stockholders time to consider the revised offer.

 Civilian unemployment dipped a tick to 5.2 percent in July, the government said Friday. Analysts say the data should ease fears of an imminent recession but heighten concerns about inflation. Joblessness was down from 5.3 percent in June, with nonfarm businesses adding 169,000 jobs, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. At the same time, June's job growth was revised from 180,000 to 250,000, additional evidence that the economy continues to grow, though at a slower pace than last year. `` This suggests an economy that is clearly, clearly far from a recession,'' said <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. `` Despite a lot of signs of economic weakness the labor market remains fairly strong.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the President's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, said the report was `` good news'' and `` suggests the economy is continuing to expand.'' While the job growth number provided encouraging news, analysts were wary over data showing significant upward pressure on wages _ a welcome development for workers but a sign of stubborn inflation as well. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said average hourly earnings rose 0.8 percent in July after increasing just 0.1 percent in the prior two months. `` That's a very, very powerful increase,'' said <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>. `` Ominous,'' was the way <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> chief economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> described the wage gains Both agreed that July's wage increase should give pause to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which of late has relaxed monetary policy in hopes of fueling enough new growth to avert a recession. `` There will be no more easing by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> until after Labor Day.'' said <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>. The government said the unemployment rate fell last month even though civilian employment declined by 82,000 people to 117.45 million. The rate fell because of a larger decline, of 146,000 people, in the labor force _ the number of people who have jobs or are seeking employment. The job growth again came predominantly in the service economy, which accounted for 140,000 of the 169,000 new positions. Within services, government employment was down by 25,000 jobs but retail trade added 52,000, wholesale trade 5,000, transportation and public utilities 23,000 and finance, insurance and real estate 11,000. Both business and health services posted modest gains, the government said. The goods-producing sector added 29,000 jobs, with gains in construction and manufacturing offset somewhat by declines in mining and the automobile industry. The 35,000 boost in construction jobs came at the same time that housing starts and home sales were rebounding. Manufacturing posted a modest gain of 3,000 positions after three consecutive monthly declines. Employment in the auto industry fell by 12,000 jobs last monh after a decline of 16,000 in June, a slump coinciding with sluggish car sales. Employment in mining was down 11,000, a figure heavily influenced by coal strikes in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> that have sparked wildcat actions in other coal-producing states. The government said the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees in private industry increased by 0.3 hours, to 34.9 hours. The factory work week held steady at 41 hours and overtime in July averaged 3.9 hours a week, up from 3.8 hours in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The jump in earnings brought average hourly pay in the private sector to $ 9.70 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from $ 9.62 in June. The payroll and wage data are taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly survey of businesses A separate household survey found few major shifts in unemployment among demographic groups, although joblessness among black teen-agers fell to 27.4 percent last month from 36.5 percent in June. The June total had been up from 32.4 percent in May. These were the July and June rates for other population groups: _ Adult white men, 3.8 percent, up from 3.7 _ Adult white women, 4.3 percent, up from 4.1 _ White teen-agers, 13.4 percent, up from 12.6 _ Adult black men, 9.3 percent, down from 9.4 _ Adult black women, 9.9 percent, down from 10.5 _ Hispanics, 9 percent, up fro 8.1 A separate calculation of unemployment that includes members of the armed services stationed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was unchanged at 5.2 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it is seeking a new partner for a $ 100 million joint venture to explore for oil and natural gas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> withdrew. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> signed a joint venture agreement April 3 to launch a three-year, 100-prospect drilling venture. Following the signing, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government was to review the agreement for approval of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in the project, but the government did not give its approval to the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> company. The South Korean government wanted assurances that all 100 prospects would be drilled in the three-year period and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> was not prepared to make that guarantee because of variables affecting oil exploration, said <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> headquarters here. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> sought a subsidy from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government to underwrite its participation in the project. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> was to bear 10 percent of the cost of the venture while 45 percent each was to be provided by <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliated company of <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The Taiwanese government has given its approval to <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>'s participation. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> is, at least for now, accepting the cost of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'s part of the venture, which already has begun with 11 wells drilled or being drilled in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` We have made provisions in case something like this happened,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has suspended contract talks with its largest union because of the possibility of a merger or change in management at the airline, a union spokesman said Friday. The company, owned by takeover specialist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, confirmed that the talks had been halted, but refused to say why. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> had previously expressed interest in buying strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and had been in extensive talks with that carrier's unions. His interest recently has shifted to other possible combinations, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union official. `` <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s been shopping that airline -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- now for the past couple months,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. `` If he's got a buyer, we're not going to impede that ... unless it's a bad deal,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> memo sent to management employees late Friday said it would be premature to speculate about a merger. `` As you are aware, the subject of combination or merger of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> has been discussed from time to time over the last several years and continues to be one of several possible strategies for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief operating officer, wrote in the memo. `` For us to speculate on any such possibilities at this time would be premature,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. Contract negotiations broke off Thursday, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of Local 949 of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union District 142. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said he received a bulletin from the union's district office in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, about the halt in negotiations. The bulletin said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> had informed the union's negotiating committee of the `` possibility of a corporate change in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> as a result of a combination or merger of the airline.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union represents mechanics, reservation clerks, janitors and other on-ground personnel. Its contract with the airline expired Dec. 31 and employees have been working under a temporary contract. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> said the union has been negotiating since last fall. `` We do n't know whether he's -LRB- <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> -RRB- looking to buy or looking to sell, we do n't know,'' said <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>. Both sides agreed to meet within 10 days to discuss and review the situation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday announced details of $ 9.5 million in payments to apple growers under a program to combat surpluses arising from concern over use of the chemical Alar. Under the plan, 57.5 million pounds of fresh apples will be diverted by 56 growers in six states to an array of organizations requesting them, including manufacturers of ethanol and livestock feed, the department said. The plan is designed to divert the apples from normal trade channels and thus, without disrupting the market, reduce a huge surplus that piled up during the first half of the year after an environmental group charged that Alar posed an unacceptably high risk of cancer. Governmental officials say that apples are safe to eat and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is taking steps to ban the use of Alar, which is sprayed on fruit to enhance red color, extend storage life and make harvetsing easier. The payments were awarded to bidders under a $ 15 million overall program to aid the industry that was announced July 25 by the department. it said growers participating are located in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Apples in the program will not be distributed through school lunch programs, the department said. It said producers will receive payments of $ 4.97 to $ 8.20 for 40-pound cartons of apples and from $ 9.45 to $ 16.50 per hundredweight for apples in bulk bins.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported it lost more money in the second quarter than it did in the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 7.7 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $ 5 million in the same quarter last year. The nation's eighth-largest airline company said revenue of its main subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, continued to suffer from lower international traffic in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last December.

The results for the latest quarter include a gain of $ 92.1 million on the sale of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> unit and expenses of $ 28.2 million stemming from its unsuccessful takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of rival <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>SEC Accuses Two Investors Of Trying To Cheat 100 Brokerages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday accused two investors of a scheme to defraud more than 100 brokerages, including <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> In a civil lawsuit, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> says the investors, Jury <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage firm, <ORGANIZATION> Fermat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, committed fraud by buying millions of dolars worth of securities without having sufficient money to pay for them and selling them later the same day at a profit to cover their cost, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions. The illegal practice is known as `` free riding.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also charges the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> violated federal banking regulations by providing the investors with credit although the two did not produce collateral. The bank was not charged with fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said the investors, through a partnership registered in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Graycliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, opened an account at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION>. The agency said the bank often covered the investors' checks overnight when the funds in the account were insufficient. The investors then opened 250 accounts at more than 100 brokerages, using 76 names, the suit charges. Since December 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> claims, the defendants used this `` web of accounts'' to buy and sell securities on the same day. The agency says the men earned more than $ 1 million through the scheme but left debts of $ 1.5 million at four brokerage houses at which they had steep losses: <ORGANIZATION> Steinberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said it found no losses at any other brokerages. Calls to the investors' office were answered by someone who identified himself as a temporary employee and said he had know knowledge of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> suit, the Times reported. A message left on <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>'s answering machine was not returned, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s home phone number is unlisted. <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON>, a laywer representing the men, said he belived the charges were without merit. `` It appears to us that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to retroactively declare illegal a type of trading many investors and banks have engaged in for many years and not thought to be illegal,'' he told the Times. He also denied that the men left debts at the four brokerages. In response to an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> request, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Thursday issued a temporary restraining order to stop the two men from continuing their investment activities. The court also froze their assets. In addition, the court issued a temporary order to restrain the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> bank from `` further violations of the credit extension provisions.'' In a statement, the bank said it had been cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> for several months and was `` an innocent bystander in the areas under investigation.''
