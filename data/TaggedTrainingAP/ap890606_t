 <PERSON> Hulk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> may be unbeatable in the wrestling ring, but he's clearly no match for <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s new movie `` No Holds Barred'' was body slammed by `` <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' which continued to break box-office records by collecting another $ 21.2 million at the nation's theaters over the weekend. According to figures released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, `` No Holds Barred'' gathered $ 5 million in its first weekend of release. `` The Last Crusade,'' which set four major box-office marks in its first week of release, broke two more records in its second week and took in as much as the next six most popular movies combined. The film, in which <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> as the dauntless archaeologist joins his father -LRB- <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> -RRB- to save the Holy Grail from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, set new records for the best 12 days and best second weekend in movie history. It could pass the $ 100 million mark next weekend and shatter yet another record. `` No Holds Barred,'' a new action-adventure film featuring wrestler <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, debuted in second place. `` See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' a crime comedy with <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, landed in third on ticket sales of $ 4.1 million. In fourth was the <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> baseball movie `` Field of Dreams'' on gross of $ 3.7 million. It was followed by `` Renegades,'' starring <PERSON> Kiefer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, opening in fifth with $ 3.1 million. `` Road House,'' featuring <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swayze </PERSON> as a bar bouncer, placed sixth with $ 3 million. Continuing its sluggish pace, <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s `` Pink Cadillac'' collected only $ 2.5 million to land in seventh place. `` K-9,'' starring <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON> and a dog as a police team, finished in eighth with $ 1.8 million. Rounding out the Top 10 were `` Pet Sematary,'' in ninth on gross of $ 1.7 million, and `` Major League,'' in 10th with $ 963,636. `` Rain Man,'' a Top 10 movie for all of 1989, finally fell off the leader board. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` Dead Poets Society,'' playing on only eight screens, collected a lively $ 340,456. Its per screen average _ $ 42,557 _ was the third best in the history of limited releases, in which a movie opens in just a handful of theaters. The only films to surpass `` Dead Poets Society'' in a limited release opening were `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' and `` The Last Temptation of Christ.'' Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release. 1. `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $ 21.2 million, 2,327 screens, $ 9,123 per screen, $ 77.1 million, two weeks. 2. `` No Holds Barred,'' New Line, $ 5 million, 1,318 screens, $ 3,761 per screen, $ 5 million, one week. 3. `` See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' Tri-Star, $ 4.1 million, 1,680 screens, $ 2,415 per screen, $ 28.9 million, four weeks. 4. `` Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $ 3.7 million, 1,100 screens, $ 3,400 per screen, $ 35.6 million, seven weeks. 5. `` Renegades,'' Universal, $ 3.1 million, 1,627 screens, $ 1,890 per screen, $ 3.1 million, one week. 6. `` Road House,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3 million, 1,880 screens, $ 1,599 per screen, $ 17.5 million, three weeks. 7. `` Pink Cadillac,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.5 million, 1,993 screens, $ 1,250 per screen, $ 7.8 million, two weeks. 8. `` K-9,'' Universal, $ 1.8 million, 1,307 screens, $ 1,410 per screen, $ 33 million, six weeks. 9. `` Pet Sematary,'' Paramount, $ 1.7 million, 1,248 screens, $ 1,370 per screen, $ 48.4 million, seven weeks. 10. `` Major League,'' Paramount, $ 963,636 million, 960 screens, $ 1,003 per screen, $ 45 million, nine weeks.

<HEAD>Blood Test May Indicate Death Risk in High Blood Pressure, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A standard test of kidney functioning may signal a higher risk of dying within eight years in people with high blood pressure, including death from heart attack or stroke, a new study suggests. The blood test is for a muscle byproduct called creatinine, and it is not clear why the substance would have anything to do with heart attack or stroke, said study co-author <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>. But he said his work suggests that people with high creatinine levels and high blood pressure should pay extra attention to reducing smoking, cutting cholesterol and taking other steps to reduce their risk of heart attack and stroke. `` It's sort of like a flashing light saying, ` I'm in a high-risk group, I better pay attention,''' he said Monday in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, associate professor of medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and colleagues from several medical schools present the work in the May issue of the journal Hypertension. The study included 10,768 people with high blood pressure. It found that those with high levels of creatinine in their blood showed higher death rates from heart attack and stroke, as well as kidney disease, researchers said. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle tissue. Kidneys normally remove it from blood, so high levels of creatinine remaining in the blood can signal kidney trouble. A normal creatinine reading is usually considered to be 0.7 to 1.5 milligrams per deciliter, <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said. The new study found that people with a reading of 1.7 or higher showed more than three times the mortality from any cause within eight years than other people did. Death rates rose with rising creatinine levels, starting with as low as 0.8 to 0.99, but with a marked jump at 1.5, <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said. About 23 percent of study subjects who showed creatinine levels of 1.5 to 1.69 were dead within eight years, rising to nearly 30 percent for those with levels between 1.7 and 1.99, <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said. Still higher creatinine levels were associated with death rates of about 40 percent and more than 50 percent. In contrast, people with levels of 0.7 to 1.09 showed death rates only around 10 percent, he said. In a separate analysis that took into account differences in age and other risk factors among the different groups, creatinine levels remained a potent predictor of death within eight years, <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said.

 Share prices opened lower Tuesday in nervous reaction to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, and thousands of residents staged funeral processions for slain protesters. The developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have focused new public attention on the accord under which the British colony will revert to Chinese rule in 1997. Officials reported a run on some China-owned banks Monday in withdrawals aimed at protesting the Chinese military's killings of hundreds and perhaps thousands of unarmed protesters in efforts to quell a popular uprising in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Thousands of angry <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the mainland government's de facto embassy in the territory. Governor Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also met <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiatun </PERSON>, head of the agency, to express his concern over the brutal force used, the government reported without giving details. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> originally was to leave Monday for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to discuss <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s future with members of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He delayed his departure to Wednesday because of the developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, some lawmakers called for a reconsideration of the agreement. But British Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s agreement to the accord. Under a Chinese-British agreement signed in 1984, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said the territory can maintain its capitalistic lifestyle under a `` one country, two systems'' concept run by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people without <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> interference. <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Pao </PERSON>, a Chinese-language daily respected for its <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> coverage, said a young guard fired four shots at Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> in the Great Hall of the People on Sunday and the premier was hit in the thigh. He was not seriously injured, and the guard was killed, the newspaper reported. The Hang Seng Index of blue chips, which plummeted on Monday to its worst loss since the worldwide market collapse in 1987, fell about 70 points shortly after the market opened Tuesday, but rebounded within an hour to 2,075 points. On Monday, the index closed at 2,093.61 points, down 581.77 points from Friday. The drop was the worst since the 1987 international market collapse, when the index fell 1,120.99 points. In nearby <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the weighted stock market index dropped 455.44 points to close at 9,120.54, the largest single-day loss in the market's 27-year history. Real estate specialists in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said property values could fall 15 to 20 percent unless the Chinese situation stabilizes. `` This is the worst scenario come to pass,'' said real estate executive <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Varty </PERSON>. `` Over the past few weeks everyone has been looking at how this matter will be played out, and this bloodshed is the worst possible way.'' Monetary Affairs Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nendick </PERSON> urged investors to remain calm and cautioned a run on mainland banks could reflect adversely on the territory's status as the world's third financial center after <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some banks said their rate of withdrawal was 30 percent higher than usual, but no figures were available. `` I think they have gone mad,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, an outspoken member of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe it -LRB- the military crackdown -RRB- is the work by a group of very old men who want to cling to their power and are prepared to sacrifice thousands and millions of lives.'' Protesters continued the rallies held daily to support the democracy movement since martial law was imposed May 20. On Monday, about 3,000 Catholics and Protestants marched past the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> office in a funeral procession for the dead. About 98 percent of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s population of 5.7 million are Chinese, and two-thirds are refugees from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or their descendants.

<TEXT>
 As the scope of Solidarity's massive election victory became clear, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> sent some advice to his friend President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: keep promoting investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Then, the shipyard electrician who rallied a restless people to challenge the Communist system got into his blue <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> van on Monday afternoon and drove off down the streets of this proud port city. International labor hero <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> still retains a host of folksy touches nearly nine years after strikes at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> that spawned Solidarity catapulted him to fame and a Nobel Peace prize. He walked with wife, <PERSON> Danuta </PERSON>, and 19-year-old son, <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON>, to cast his ballot at city polling station No. 169 in Sunday's historic elections A young woman outside the polling station gave him a red rose and praised his tireless efforts. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> replied with a smile: `` Well, I did n't do all this just for myself.'' Like many busy men wrapped up in their work, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has trouble taking time off. `` We hope you can go on vacation. You deserve it,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, a close adviser, told him as 3,000 people cheered outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s church. `` We hope you can go to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Only half of <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>'s wish is officially scheduled now: <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is heading to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this fall for a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and most likely another meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is heading over to the <LOCATION> Walesas </LOCATION>' for lunch next month. There, the president will sit down to a traditional Polish meal with the 45-year-old <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, his wife and at least some of the couple's eight children in a pleasant residential area outside central <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. `` This is a rehearsal for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said with a hearty laugh as he acted as host at a private party on election eve at his single-family home on 54 Polanki Street. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will sit at a plain wooden table, surrounded by paintings of nature scenes and religious motifs. When <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> shows <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into the living room, the president will see a picture of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on the wall. `` My highest authority'' is the way <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholic </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refers to his Polish-born hero and mentor in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president visited <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in 1987. A photograph of the two conferring adorns the wall outside <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s office in the gritty local headquarters of Solidarity two blocks from the shipyard. Like any folk hero, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has his trademarks _ the handle-bar mustache, the Solidarity badge, the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> of Czestochowa pin on his lapel. Less well-known is his bluntness. On Monday, the labor federation leader, wearing a blue sportcoat, bulldozed through reporters seeking a statement from him on election results. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the voting shows Poles want `` very big reforms'' but also cautioned `` we have to keep searching further'' to solve the nation's woes. Then he bounded up the steps back into the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s rectory to cap a victory he has been seeking along with his larger successes: assuring the future of the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>. In what he called an act of providence, Polish-born American multimillionaire <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Piasecka-Johnson </PERSON> stepped in with a promise of a huge investment to rescue the ailing yard from a government-ordered shutdown. After lunch with Mrs. <PERSON> Piasecka-Johnson </PERSON>, her advisers and members of the Communist-picked shipyard management Monday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> used the occasion to promote the next phase of his cause: reform of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s faltering and often chaotic economy `` All our political victories will mean nothing if we do n't improve the economy,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> faces constant shortages of consumer goods, spare parts and food items. Many Poles disillusioned with the country's plight seek work in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere. To ease the situation, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been seeking to attract foreign investment. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration recently began leading the cheers for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s success in that area. `` What Mrs. <PERSON> Piasecka-Johnson </PERSON> is doing is a continuation of what President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already told us,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in reference to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration support for Polish economic reforms. `` She is fulfilling it immediately.'' `` So I am sending a personal letter through her to the president in which I thank him for wanting to meet <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> halfway,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> then handed Mrs. <PERSON> Piasecka-Johnson </PERSON> a plain white envelope containing the letter for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as news photographers' cameras clicked and TV cameras whirred.

Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, asked for the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported last October that <PERSON> Gronvall </PERSON> had ordered a change in methodology to lower the percentage of VA hospitals showing abnormal death The newspaper reported results of the study in Tuesday editions. The telephone number listed for the author of the study was answered by someone who said he no longer lives there. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he had seen a copy of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report earlier in the day. <PERSON> Gronvall </PERSON> was traveling and could not be reached, but judging by his letter to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> contained in the report commenting in the findings, `` I think he feels somewhat vindicated,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The dispute arose when another VA staff member, the late Dr. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, argued in memos that chaging the study methods could be seen as `` self serving.'' The issue is what statistical cut-off to use in judging whether death rates are within the normal range of variation. Only six of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s 172 hospitals _ 3.5 percent _ would be judged to have abnormal death rates if the analyst wants to be 99 percent sure that the determination is not the result of normal fluctations. But if the analyst wants to be 95 percent sure, 12 hospitals or 7 percent would be judged to have abnormal death rates. VA began the study after the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> found that 2.5 percent of the nation's private hospitals had abnormally high death rates. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and the financing agency kept records differently and the percentages arrived at by the two studies could not be compared. The Veterans Department plans to release its study next week using both statistical cutoffs, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Railroad, Pipeline Company Agree on Community Reparations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A railroad and a fuel-shipping company announced plans Monday to reimburse residents of a neighborhood stricken by twin disasters last month. The deal outlines community reparations, promises $ 5,000 for each family evacuated, assures residents that the site is safe and calls for a study of utilities in the area. For the <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the agreement cleared city objections to plans to replace its 14-inch diameter petroleum fuel line, which exploded in a deadly fireball on May 25, about two weeks after a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> train derailed on May 12. Four people, including two residents were killed in the derailment, and two residents were killed in the pipeline explosion. Dozens more were injured in the explosion. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators have focused on the possibility that the out-of-control freight damaged the nearby pipeline as it vaulted from the tracks. The plan was announced jointly by city officials, executives of <LOCATION> Calnev </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>. ` No court would have ordered them to do what they've agreed to do today,'' City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said. `` The question now is whether this is going to be finalized.'' One of the things city officials had sought was immediate assistance for displaced families, and <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said, `` that $ 5,000 reimbursement really helps.'' The $ 5,000 is to be paid to each family that returns to their home. Calnev officials said the payments, estimated to total about $ 750,000, would begin Wednesday. `` What the agreement is today is a first crack at getting started,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrukaitis </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> GATX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminals </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>'s corporate owner. `` It is nowhere near a comprehensive settlement.'' The companies tentatively agreed to reimburse the city for overtime paid for police, fire and other emergency personnel, continue to pay for housing and meals for displaced families and to buy the homes that were destroyed or severely damaged. The new pipeline will buried at least six feet deep, twice the federal standard and covered with concrete for 600 feet, the length of the rail disaster area, <PERSON> Andrukaitis </PERSON> said. `` If we can get the new line in by Wednesday, we'd test it Thursday and possibly be operating by Friday,'' <PERSON> Andrukaitis </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> W.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> said Monday that 95 homes out of the 178 that were evacuated would be immediately reopened for residents' return. `` All the environmental and safety experts agree on the safety and integrity of the area,'' <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> said. The city attorney emphasized <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>'s support for a federal study of the placement of gasoline, natural gas pipelines and other vital utilities in the greater <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> area. If the study recommends moving the <LOCATION> Calnev </LOCATION> fuel line, the company has agreed to do it, <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said. The proposed engineering study would examine the sort of juxtaposition that apparently played a role in the double disasters.

 House members have flooded the Rules Committee with more than 100 proposed amendments to savings and loan bailout legislation, dimming the chances of floor action this week. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which announced its <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L proposal on Feb. 6 and challenged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act within 45 days, has shown increasing impatience with the pace of action in the House. The Rules Committee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the ranking Democrat after the death last week of former chairman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, is scheduled to consider the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation on Tuesday. It will decide which amendments will be considered by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when it takes up <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation written by the Banking, Judiciary and Ways and Means panels. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., told <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> last week that he wants the Rules panel to finish work Tuesday so the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> can take up the bill on Wednesday However, nearly 50 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members have asked to speak to the Rules Committee and the panel must wade through more than 109 amendments, a difficult task to achieve in one day. If the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> finished work Wednesday, the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could begin debate on Thursday, but, since the chamber is out of session on Friday, any vote likely would be delayed until next week. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed this thing on April 19 and the losses -LRB- in S & amp; Ls -RRB- have grown by over $ 500 million since that date,'' said Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>. The industry `` is just hemorrhaging out there and every day they delay passage costs at least $ 10 million,'' he said. More than half a dozen of the amendments under consideration would weaken what the administration considers the key change in the bill _ a requirement that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners invest at least $ 3 in tangible or `` real money'' capital for every $ 100 in lending. A high capital level acts as a buffer, absorbing losses before federal deposit insurance kicks in. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Financial Institutions, had planned to offer an amendment that would allow regulators, at their discretion, to count `` supervisory goodwill'' as tangible capital, but pulled back after the administration decided to oppose it The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday editions that Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Tenn </LOCATION>., planned to urge the Rules Committee to allow the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to vote on an amendment that would weaken restrictions on counting goodwill as tangible capital It said the measure would benefit several hundred S & amp; Ls, including <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON> has at least $ 200,000 on deposit. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L, was quoted by the newspaper as saying that without the amendment the institution would have to come up with cash to replace $ 28 million in goodwill it currently counts as capital. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> was quoted as saying he asked <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON> to sponsor the measure. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said the amendment's effect on <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON> would be minimal, perhaps $ 250, and added: `` If you try to pin a conflict on him it would be criminal. It would be low down.'' <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` In my mind, there is no conflict'' of interest. Efforts to reach him by telephone Monday night were unsuccessful. Supervisory goodwill is an accounting break offered by regulators in the early 1980s to institutions that took ailing S & amp; Ls off the government's hands. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> argues that it is unfair to penalize S & amp; Ls who took the accounting break at the government's urging. However, the administration argues that it is unfair to taxpayers to allow the institutions with supervisory goodwill to operate with none of their owners' money at risk. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, including Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, met with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials last Thursday in attempt to secure the administration's support for their compromise amendment However, <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said the proposal `` is simply not acceptable to us.'' As an alternate, <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> will back an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., that would permit institutions with goodwill to use administrative appeals to delay the imposition of tougher capital rules for up to 18 months Other amendments before the Rules Committee would, if permitted to reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, reopen virtually every major battle already fought in the committees that wrote the bill. Several amendments would delete provisions designed to help provide housing to poor people. Others would weaken the requirement that the S & amp; L industry contribute $ 300 million a year to pay interest on government bailout borrowing.

 Gunfire spread around the capital Tuesday morning, and sources said an army corps opposed to the government's assault on pro-reform demonstrators was preparing to attack the corps that carried out the crackdown Soldiers were fighting soldiers around <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and in southwestern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the sources said on condition of anonymity. A Chinese source reported seeing seven wounded soldiers lying on a street in southeastern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Hundreds of people were killed Saturday when troops shot, beat and crushed students and other protesters who had been occupying Tiananmen Square since May 13, demonstrating for democratic reforms and against corruption. Chinese and diplomatic sources said the <ORGANIZATION> 38th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is commissioned with defending the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> area, was preparing to move against the <ORGANIZATION> 27th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which carried out Saturday's attack. The 38th was originally told to enforce martial law imposed by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> on May 20, but refused to send troops into the city. The 27th is based in <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Each corps is made up of three divisions and has between 35,000 and 40,000 men. The Ming Pao newspaper of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> quoted what it said were informed sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as saying a young guard shot <PERSON> Li </PERSON> in the thigh Sunday in the Great Hall of the People. It said <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s wound was not severe and that his assailant was immediately shot to death. By late Monday, the defensive positions taken by troops occupying central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> clearly indicated their focus switched from shooting citizens to preparing for a battle. Troops occupied bridges and other strategic locations going into the square and shot at cars and pedestrians trying to get through. Thousands of troops and tanks occupying the square lined up along the northern perimeter facing the former imperial palace. Other tanks took up new positions on key intersections off the 100-acre square. Gunfire could be heard from behind the palace, and artillery shelling was heard in a far northwest suburb of the city. Nine tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers left the square Tuesday morning, heading eastward. At least three people died and four were injured Monday as troops armed with machine guns and automatic rifles kept up sporadic, indiscriminate firing. Chinese witnesses said the dead included a man machine-gunned from his chin to his stomach. The wounded included a girl shot in the chest when troops charged up a narrow residential street. Anti-government disturbances were reported in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION> and at least three cities in the northeast. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most populous city, all public transportation stopped Monday as people moved buses and other barricades into intersections. Thousands of people joined funeral marches through <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> on Monday, and students blocked major streets to prevent buses from running. Chinese sources said Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON> was stripped of power for opposing the decision of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to end seven weeks of student demonstrations with military force. Despite repeated announcements on Chinese television praising the military action against the people of the capital, no national leader has appeared in public or on television to take responsibility for the military takeover of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The student unrest triggered a major power struggle in the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership, with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and other conservative hardliners gaining the upper hand and reportedly stripping power from Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who favored making concessions to the students. There was a chorus of condemnation from around the world at the army's attack on the demonstrators. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would suspend all military sales and visits of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military leaders but announced that diplomatic ties would not be severed. The American, British and other embassies were evacuating some of their nationals from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities out of fear troops would move onto campuses to stifle anti-government activities. A <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student said, `` Many of the -LRB- Chinese -RRB- students have left the dormitories to go home or to find shelter in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> because they fear an imminent attack by the army.'' The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government sent a special flight Monday to evacuate residents of the British colony. Residents in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> spent the day preparing for food shortages, with lines forming for milk, oil, soy sauce and other staples. Blockades of buses and burning vehicles made major streets impassable, and many <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents stayed home from work out of fear of the roaming bands of soldiers. One convoy of 50 to 100 military trucks rumbled through the diplomatic quarter firing indiscriminately, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official said. More than 40 soldiers later swaggered down the main street bordering the diplomatic section, firing in the air. Residents scattered but reappeared to shout jeers after the soldiers. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents enraged by the shooting defied the heavily armed military by blockading streets and vowing continued support for the pro-democracy students. Many wore black armbands to honor the dead. `` It's not over, it's just getting started,'' said a 38-year-old educator outside the main gate of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Normal University, where hundreds of people gathered to back the students. `` The people have just found out what democracy is really about.'' On man climbed on top of the lead vehicle of a 20-tank convoy. He got down but again moved to block its way when the tank tried to drive around him. Several people had to drag him to safety. The official media continued to defend the military crackdown on unarmed civilians as a justified battle against `` thugs'' and `` ruffians.'' The national television station late Monday showed footage of young people throwing rocks at troops and military personnel carriers entering the city. One segment showed people attacking a stalled truck, heaving rocks through the windshield and saying the two soldiers inside were beaten to death.

 <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, the two major representatives of the newest wave of make-it-on-your-own black film makers, were honored Monday night for doing things their way. `` They are independent in spirit, they are determined and they fought against insurmountable odds and surmounted them,'' said <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON>, who overcame the odds a generation ago with `` Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON>, an elder statesman of black film making, presented a special award to <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmmaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s 10th anniversary gala and tribute at the Majestic Theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The foundation is the nation's largest distributor of independently produced work by black film makers. Its 1,500 members include major film and television producers, writers, directors, actors and film students. Also being honored were films and videos produced independently of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and commercial television in the last 10 years. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> first became known three years ago for `` She's Got ta Have It,'' a sexual comedy about a young woman and her partners. He furthered his reputation with `` School Daze,'' a peek at black colleges, and his `` Do the Right Thing'' was the talk of the <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> film festival last month. It premieres later this month. <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> raised cash with his credit cards to finance `` Hollywood Shuffle,'' a revealing look at the stereotypes and prejudices black actors face on and off the screen in the movie-making world. He has moved on to four HBO specials and a feature film, `` The Mighty Quinn,'' with <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> nominee <PERSON> Denzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> now is writing and starring in a musical comedy, `` Heartbeats,'' about a singing group.

<HEAD>Race-Bias Ruling Assailed by Civil Rights Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civil rights advocates are accusing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of abandoning the nation's 25-year-old commitment to fair treatment in the workplace for minorities and women. They expressed alarm and dismay over a ruling Monday they said undercuts the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and will make it far more difficult for workers to prove with statistical evidence that they are victims of racial or gender bias. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, said, `` If the court continues down this path, the civil rights laws will be just an empty shell. But <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> did not predict any immediate action in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reverse the 5-4 court ruling. `` It's a major step backwards,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund. `` The court has made it much more difficult for -LRB- plaintiffs -RRB- to win and at the same time has made it easier for employers to defend themselves.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, also with the fund, predicted civil rights lawyers now will concentrate on cases where they can prove intentional discrimination and seek big money damages to punish employers who discriminate. `` It is going to make litigation a lot tougher and a lot nastier,'' he said. `` It means fewer cases and bigger awards.'' But business leaders hailed the ruling and said most employers will remain committed to affirmative action even if the threat of losing lawsuits is reduced. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokat </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said, `` I'm really pleased. It went much further than I thought the court would go. This means fewer specious cases will be brought. Employers are going to be able to defend these cases more easily,'' he said. Monday's ruling focused on so-called `` disparate impact'' cases where allegations of bias are based on statistics showing under-representation for minorities rather than deliberate discrimination. The decision divided the high court sharply and prompted bitter remarks from the dissenting justices. `` One wonders whether the majority still believes that race discrimination _ or, more accurately, race discrimination against non-whites _ is a problem in our society, or even remembers that it ever was,'' said Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> in a dissenting opinion. The court overturned a lower court ruling that had favored Filipinos, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> natives and Asians employed during the summer at <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> salmon canneries. The minority groups said they have been relegated to the lower-paying jobs there. The justices sent the case back to the lower courts with instructions to use the high court's new guidelines making it more difficult for the minority groups to win their lawsuit. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, writing for the court, said that when minorities use statistics to show they are bias victims, employers only must produce evidence that there is a legitimate reason for apparently neutral business practices. The burden of proving the practices are non-discriminatory _ of persuading a jury there is no bias _ does not shift to the employer, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. He added that the workers must suggest alternative practices that do not have an unfair impact on minorities, but said employers can not be forced to adopt the alternatives if they are more costly. The court also limited the statistical evidence that minorities can use to prove discrimination. For example, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said a lack of minority group members in skilled jobs is not evidence of bias if the absence reflects `` a dearth of qualified non-white applicants for reasons that are not -LRB- the employer's -RRB- fault.'' He said the minority groups must show that any under-representation in skilled jobs is tied directly to specific business practices under attack. White said that without such protection for employers their only recourse to eliminate racial imbalance in their work forces would be unlawful quotas. In other action, the court: _ Ruled, 5-2, that the main method used by the Church of Scientology to receive money from members does not entitle them to federal income tax deductions _ Handed artists and authors a victory by unanimously ruling that a homeless-rights group in the nation's capital does not hold exclusive copyright to a sculpture it commissioned an artist to create _ Cleared the way for trial of a government lawsuit against junk bond specialist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and removed a major obstacle to a $ 650 million payment by his former employer to investors and the federal treasury _ Rejected an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients who want to use their own money to pay for an assistant surgeon in eye cataract operations

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once suggested that the more he learned about the Chinese the less he understood them. Now, his experience in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a guiding influence in setting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the troubled giant. In his announcement Monday of a cutoff in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to protest the bloody suppression of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy movement, the government's No. 1 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hand said he took the action because he understands <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` reasonably well.'' For that reason, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the events of the past few days could only leave him with `` a saddened heart.'' `` I am trying to take steps that will encourage a peaceful change, and yet recognize the fact that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does have a great pride in its own history. And my recommendations are based on my knowledge of Chinese history,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. That does n't mean he understands what has happened, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who less than four months ago shook hands with bicyclists in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, presented <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cowboy boots to Prime Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and bantered about exercise regimens with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. Of the military assault that left hundreds dead and thousands wounded, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I condemn it; I do n't try to explain it.'' Asked for his best assessment of the political situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also demurred. `` It's too obscure,'' he said at a news conference Monday. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> expertise has always been a major element of the well-laden foreign-policy resume that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought to the Oval Office. For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for 16 months in 1974-75 and since then has visited the nation five times, this expertise is also the source of extreme caution _ a caution that previously provoked criticism. In his 1987 pre-election autobiography, `` Looking Forward,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote that during his tour of duty in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> he often had the `` feeling the more you learn about the Chinese, the less you really understand them.'' `` I have a special affection for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. I've kept up my knowledge of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and my relationship with various leaders there,'' he told a business audience Monday night. Although <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders of both parties were near unanimous in their praise for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stern but careful actions Monday, his reticence in speaking out for human rights when he visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in late February prompted criticism. The criticism intensified when a dissident he invited to a farewell banquet, astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, was barred by Chinese police from attending the ceremony. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended this caution anew on Monday while issuing his strongest criticism thus far of the Chinese government. `` This is not a time for anything other than a prudent, reasoned response,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his actions Monday will deny the Chinese more than $ 600 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government military equipment sales and an estimated $ 85 million or so annually in private arms sales. He also banned visits by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military officials, offered humanitarian and medical assistance to those wounded in the assault and suggested that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would extend the visas of Chinese students here afraid to return to their homeland. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, said he was not ready to do `` something more flamboyant,'' such as recommend trade sanctions or recall the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, `` because I happen to believe that this relationship is vital to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested, as he has in the past, that he's sensitive to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s own sensitivity to outside criticism. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> historically has been less than totally interested in what other countries think of their performance,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Still, he expressed hope that `` the depth of the feeling towards democracy is so great that you ca n't put the genie back in the bottle and return to total repression.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions won support from many on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` This is a time to allow the president to lead on that kind of issue, especially when you have a president with this level of personal expertise in Chinese affairs,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>

 Vestiges of school segregation remain in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> 35 years after it lost the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> decision, which paved the way for desegregation of schools nationwide, a federal appeals court ruled. The 10th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> panel's decision, made available Monday, reversed a ruling that would have closed the case that found `` separate but equal'' schools for blacks and whites unconstitutional. The case was reopened 10 years ago by parents who said <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>'s schools were still segregated `` We won,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an attorney representing the parents of 17 black schoolchildren. `` We feel that 10 years of work was not in vain. We feel vindicated by the decision. It's been quite a long time coming.'' The group involved in the lawsuit included parent <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, who was a student when her name went on the original lawsuit. `` My first reaction was shock, then I was pleased, very pleased,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>'s sister. `` I believe that the case showed that there is a lot of educational enhancement that is not taking place here.'' In its decision published in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on Friday, the panel rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' contention in April 1987 that parents of minority students had to prove a pattern of intentional discrimination to force the district to come up with a plan for more racially balanced schools. `` Because we are convinced that <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> has not sufficiently countered the effects of both the momentum of its pre-Brown segregation and its subsequent segregative acts in the 1960s, we reverse,'' the appeals court said. The judges also reversed a lower court ruling that the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> school district had not violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebelius </PERSON>, an attorney for the the school district, said officials were awaiting receipt of the dissenting opinion in the 2-1 ruling before deciding whether to appeal. He added that the ruling confirmed the high quality of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>'s schools `` Throughout their decision they note that <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> offers excellent educational opportunities to all its students, wherever they be,'' <PERSON> Sebelius </PERSON> said. `` There was absolutely no hint or contest of the quality education the district provides.'' The court noted that neither the school district nor the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> community was actively resisting desegregation, and cited the national recognition of the district's innovative curriculum. `` This active engagement has largely been directed at concerns other than desegregation, however,'' the appeals court said. `` For the most part, the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> school district has exercised a form of benign neglect.'' The original class-action lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> law authorizing school segregation. The May 17, 1954, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision paved the way for nationwide school desegregation and busing. <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> schools were required to submit an integration plan, which was approved in 1955. In 1979, the case was revived by black parents who claimed <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> had failed to desegregate its schools. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> found the school district to be integrated and unified. Local officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People at the time blasted <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' decision, saying blacks could not get a fair hearing because of racism in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>. The appeals court ruled that the district's policy of permitting students to attend neighborhood schools was insufficient to desegregate schools because neighborhoods are still racially segregated. <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> is 90 percent white. There are about 14,000 students in the city school district.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet naval accidents have littered the ocean floor with at least 50 nuclear weapons and 10 nuclear reactors since World War II, according to a report released today by the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmental group. Forty-three of the 50 weapons and six of the nine reactors are Soviet, and the real number may be much higher because so few details are known of secretive Soviet navy operations, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, an analyst who worked with <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> on the project. `` We got no information at all from the Soviets,'' said <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> interest group. `` We were totally unsuccessful in getting any kind of real response from them. And we were totally unsuccessful in getting any information from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence about Soviet naval accidents.'' Using material obtained from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government under the Freedom of Information Act, the researchers listed 1,276 accidents since World War II involving military vessels. The accidents caused more than 2,800 deaths and ranged in severity from the loss of an entire vessel and crew to minor collisions and fires that caused little damage and few if any injuries. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said that of the accidents, 228 involved aircraft carriers, 406 other major surface warships, 182 supply ships, 142 minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels. Separately, 75 incidents involved sinkings. Twenty-seven submarines have sunk in that period, including five Soviet, four American, four French and three British, as well as submarines from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the analysts reported in their 101-page study. Perhaps the most serious accident was the sinking of a Soviet Yankee-class submarine on Oct. 6, 1986, with 32 nuclear warheads and two nuclear torpedoes aboard 600 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. More recently, a Soviet ` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>' class submarine sank off the coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in April with two nuclear reactors and two nuclear tipped torpedoes aboard, the report said. `` Between 1975-1985, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had over 200 serious submarine accidents,'' according to a summary of the report. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has had more sinkings, more propulsion failures, and according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources, more accidents than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> earlier revealed information about two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accidents that received wide publicity over the past month. In 1965, an A-4 warplane fell off the USS Ticonderoga off <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> with a hydrogen bomb aboard, and on Nov. 22, 1975, a fire aboard the USS Belknap came within 40 feet of nuclear weapons. Although the report carried the greatest detail about incidents involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels, its sharpest criticism was of the Soviets. <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said he planned to deliver a Russian-language version of the study to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and would seek a meeting with Soviet officials. `` Official secrecy, particularly that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as well as sporadic news media interest in reporting routine accidents, are major impediments to compiling a complete record,'' the report said. `` Of the 1,276 accidents, 799 have involved naval ships of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' it said. `` This preponderance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accidents does not mean a higher accident rate than other navies, particularly the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` Many hundreds more Soviet accidents are known to have occurred, but due to inadequate data and excessive secrecy, we have been unable to document specific dates or circumstances,'' it said. Asked in a telephone interview to give an example of a Soviet naval accident in which nuclear weapons or reactors were suspected but not documented to be involved, <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> cited the sinking of a destroyer in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in 1974. `` A Kashin-class destroyer with 275 crewmen sank with all hands. Our speculation is that there were probably nuclear torpedoes aboard,'' said <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Jury Selected As Abortion Demonstration Trial Takes Center Stage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge sat center stage, the defendants took up the orchestra, mezzanine and balcony and a defense attorney asked potential jurors if they'd ever had an abortion. Set in a 300-seat theater, the drama was real as 155 anti-abortion activists went on trial Monday for trespassing during a protest at a clinic April 15. The judge had to rent the hall intended for nightclub acts and jazz ensembles because no local courtroom was big enough. `` Here in the first row,'' attorney <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> asked before a jury of six was selected, `` has anyone had an abortion?'' When a prosecutor objected, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> asked whether any of the 95 prospective jurors knew of anyone who had had an abortion. About half said yes. More than 180 people were arrested and charged with trespassing during the protest organized by Operation Rescue. The charge carries up to a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. Some pleaded no contest and received six months' probation. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> merged the cases and rented a theater at the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> complex for about $ 5,000 for what is expected to be a weeklong trial. `` We're not here to determine the issue of abortion,'' said Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavandera </PERSON>, standing before a stage set up with a makeshift judge's bench. `` You are being selected to serve on a jury, not on a legislative delegation,'' he said. `` What I'm concerned with is if you can set aside your own preconceptions and follow the law.''

<HEAD>Agreement Must be Studied in Artificial Insemination Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman who got a semen sample from a friend and bore a child _ then got a court to rule that the man had no rights as the father _ has been dealt a setback by the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The Juvenile Court judge who held that the friend was not, technically, the father must take another look at the case to determine precisely what the pre-conception agreement between the two was, the high court ruled Monday. The woman had argued that she never promised to recognize her friend as the father and that even if she had, state law specifies that sperm donors have no parental rights. Court papers identified the couple only by initials. Records showed that in 1985, <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> donated semen to E.C., a woman he had known for two years. A doctor inseminated her, and she gave birth in 1986. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> then sought a declaration he was the father, alleging that he and E.C. had agreed in advance that he would be treated as the father. He also argued that the law giving sperm donors no parental rights did not apply to unmarried women who knew the donor. Juvenile Court Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> ruled that evidence of a pre-conception agreement was irrelevant. But Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Vollack </PERSON> said that what the man and woman agreed to in advance is indeed relevant. The high court cited a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case in which a sperm donor was declared the legal father and given visitation rights.

<HEAD>Emigration Drops During May, But Exodus Still at 10-Year High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> dropped sharply last month but is still at a 10-year high, according to figures released today. The <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION> said 3,333 Soviet Jews registered at a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> transit center in May, a 20 percent drop from April. The committee helps Jews leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and resettle elsewhere. Only 96 emigrants opted for new homes in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said committee spokeswoman <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucault </PERSON>. Most want to settle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Boucault </PERSON> said the agency had no explanation for the decline in emigration. The May arrivals brought the 1989 total to 16,197; 524 chose the Jewish state as their destination, she said. The total for all of 1988 was 20,082. The program began in 1971 and reached a peak in 1979 when 51,328 Jews were allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The numbers dropped sharply after the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> chilled East-West relations. The pace of emigration is now at its highest level since 1979.

<TEXT>
 Like a paddlewheel steamer trailing in a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> race, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is trying to pass <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in the riverboat gambling sweepstakes and pull in the fresh catch: dollars. Backers of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> legislation to legalize riverboat gambling say the payoff could be 2,500 new jobs, $ 200 million in initial riverfront investment and as much as $ 700 million a year in economic spinoffs. The loser, they say, could be left at the dock. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> already has authorized riverboat gambling on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> beginning in 1991. `` The -LRB- state -RRB- there first is going to attract the people,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, sponsor of legislation to legalize riverboat gambling next year on the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> side of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and much of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' bill, and one allowing betting on the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, were overwhelmingly approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month and are now in the House.

Unlike the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> legislation, which limits bets to $ 5 and losses to $ 200 per person per excursion, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> bills permit losses up to $ 500.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has approved a plan by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to take over the troubled <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> schools for 10 years. In a 29-10 vote Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the first-in-the-nation plan for a private university to run a public school system. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> schools have been woefully underfunded, according to officials, and the 3,400 students in the largely working-class and predominantly Spanish-speaking city outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> have one of the highest dropout rates in the state. The bill now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which gave its approval last week but must consider a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amendment requiring periodic reports to the state by BU. Monday's vote was criticized by teachers unions who say the plan would deprive teachers of access to important personnel records. Many officials, including Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, have also criticized provisions exempting <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> from open meeting laws. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not said whether he will sign the legislation. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> said it will raise money from foundations and corporations and offer a variety of programs, including education of preschoolers and aid for pregnant teen-agers. `` The schoolchildren of <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION> are going to be very happy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. `` We're going to abide by the open meeting and the public records laws, and we've said all along we're going to abide by those. `` The fight is not over,'' declared <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION>'s teachers. The union has sued to block what he called `` an arrogant kind of takeover.'' <PERSON> Rosanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called the takeover an embarassment for the state. `` It's outrageous that <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> has been allowed to get to the condition it's in,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was buried today after frenzied mourners knocked his body to the ground and ripped his white burial shroud to pieces for mementos of the revolutionary who ruled <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for 10 years. Thousands of Revolutionary Guards and civilians pushed and shoved around the graveside, kicking up clouds of dust as <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s body was taken from a metal casket and lowered to the grave at 4:45 p.m. `` They are burying a sacred body,'' screamed a television announcer, his voice hoarse with emotion, as soldiers piled concrete blocks on top of the shrouded body. `` Oh, Father, do n't leave your children! Oh, father, do n't leave your beloved!'' he wailed. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the driving force of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution, died Saturday at age 86. Amid scenes of mass hysteria, the huge crowd surrounding the grave beat their heads with their hands in expressions of grief and threw dust on themselves to show they wanted to be buried with their spiritual patriarch. Several people were knocked unconscious in crushes at the cemetery and earlier at <LOCATION> Mosalla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION>, where mourners stopped the nearly 10-hour funeral procession. They blocked the path of a van driving the body to the cemetery, grabbed the corpse out of an open wooden coffin and ripped the shroud to pieces. The body fell to the ground. In the chaos, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son was knocked down, but appeared uninjured. State television later showed mourners grabbing the body and pulling the shroud, until the feet could be seen. The broadcast then was cut off abruptly for several minutes. The body was rewrapped, placed in a closed metal casket and airlifted to the <LOCATION> Baheshte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zahra </LOCATION> cemetery, with mourners clinging to the helicopter's landing sled until it was several feet off the ground. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was buried next to Iranians who helped him seize power in the 1979 revolution that toppled a 2,500-year-old monarchy, and soldiers killed in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. There was no immediate word on whether people were killed or injured in the crowd that gathered in 91-degree heat. At least eight people were killed and hundreds hurt on Monday during a similar huge show of mass grief. The chaos occurred when the grieving multitudes stopped the funeral procession a half-mile from the <LOCATION> Mosalla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s body had lain in state since Monday in an air-conditioned, glass-encased bier. Two helicopters had landed nearby, and officials were moving the body from a hearse to a helicopter when the crowd pushed toward them. Security forces fired in the air to disperse the crowds, but the throngs remained, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Earlier, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, 43, was knocked down outside the mosque. His black turban fell off as he was hoisted above the crowds and passed from hand to hand to an ambulance at the edge of the square. He appeared pale and shaken. The hearse carrying the body was stranded in a sea of mourners clad in black, unable to move forward because of the crowds, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. Shouts of `` Allah Akbar!'' _ God is Great _ echoed across the city. Many of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s 6 million people turned out to bid <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> farewell. Millions more converged on the city from other regions, the official media reported. The procession began at 7 a.m. when <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s devout militants, the Revolutionary Guards, carried his body down from the bier. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s body lay on the ground in the open air as the white-bearded <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad-Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Golpaygani </PERSON> prayed. <PERSON> Golapaygani </PERSON>, one of the four remaining senior ayatollahs in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, lifted his spectacles to wipe tears with a handkerchief. After the 30-minute service, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s body was placed in a wooden coffin covered with a white cloth, then carried by Revolutionary Guards from hand to hand into a white van. Crowds cried hysterically. Readings from the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, blared from the mosque's minaret as the masses cried: `` Farewell beloved imam!'' and `` Oh <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, why have you left us?'' In the chaos, women, clad in head-to-toe black chadors, were rubbing shoulders with men, defying an Islamic ban on physical contact between a woman and a man other than her husband. Firefighters sprayed mourners with water to cool them off. About 2 million frenzied mourners had kept a nightlong candle-lit vigil around the bier. Some scratched their faces until the blood ran and threw ashes over their clothes. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died of a heart attack 11 days after intestinal surgery without resolving the problem of who would succeed him. He left a 29-page `` political testament,'' excerpts of which were read over <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio on Monday. The excerpts made no reference to how <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should be governed after his death. But such proposals may have been in sections not made public. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, 49, was appointed caretaker leader Sunday. A presidential election and referendum on constitutional reforms, which are likely to increase the president's executive power, are scheduled for Aug. 18. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s swift appointment was designed mainly to fill the vacuum amid political turmoil that has prevailed since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> launched his resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism in February with a call for the death of British novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. In the absence of a single personality who can match <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s religious and political authority, it seemed likely <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be ruled by a collective leadership <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> has endorsed the presidential candidacy of Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 55, a political ally and the only declared candidate.

<TEXT>
 Democrats today nominated <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as the 49th speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, moving decisively to replace <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and end months of political tumult spawned by charges of ethical misconduct. The full House was expected to ratify the majority Democrats' choice by the end of the day, and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was moving to set the tone for his stewardship `` I hope that this can be the beginning of the movement of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> back to the business for which the public elected us to serve,'' he told reporters as he arrived at the Capitol. He said he hoped to quickly `` restore a mood of conciliation, reconciliation and cooperation between the two parties.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, unopposed, was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus in a unanimous voice vote. Still to come, perhaps next week, were contests for other Democratic leadership posts made vacant by the ethics turmoil, including the No. 2 position of majority leader held by <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. Republicans were powerless to stop <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s election, since Democrats command a 259-175 majority. But they voted this morning to nominate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> as their candidate for speaker in a symbolic act. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, who by tradition was to introduce <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, told fellow Republicans today that their party has been mistreated under Democratic control, and just getting rid of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wo n't correct things by itself `` The House has been corrupted by the absolute power of one-party domination and it is n't going to be cured by a personality transplant,'' he said, accepting his party's nomination. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> already was attacking <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as a political enemy more liberal than his reputation indicated. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was driven from the leadership by ethics charges that he tried to skirt House rules on outside income. He steadfastly maintained his innocence, but said in a dramatic speech to his colleagues last week that he would step down to prevent the controversy from paralyzing the House. Republican strategists are trying to label all Democrats as corrupt from an uninterrupted third of a century ruling the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. They cite as examples <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s unprecedented decision to resign the speakership because of ethics charges, and the announcement by Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., that he'll step down to avoid an ethics inquiry <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who recognizes that Democrats must not be seen as less ethical than Republicans, has said revising <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules and campaign laws will be a top priority. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, is a 12 -LCB- - year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership with a reputation for negotiating the tough deals through persistence and compromise As majority leader, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was spared some of the pressure directed at the speaker's office, but Republicans began firing at him before his election today. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, communications director of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, distributed a four-page memorandum portraying <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as an `` ultra-liberal'' who has cleverly managed to avoid any left-leaning label. `` Over the years, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has been able to create a reputation based on a false perception that he is a bipartisan, moderate political creature,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said. The memo cited the relatively low marks over the years <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record has earned from conservative groups. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> declined to comment directly on the attack, saying through a spokesman that he hoped `` to establish a sense of comity and respect within the House.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has represented the congressional district on the eastern side of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since 1965. With a mostly mainstream Democratic voting record, he has had some close elections in that fairly conservative territory although wider margins in recent years. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> entered the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership when former Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> appointed him as majority whip, a position which now is elected. He earned a reputation as a master of compromise, and when <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> retired at the end of 1986 and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was elected speaker, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> moved up uncontested to majority leader. Now, as then, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> refused to coast into his new slot. Instead of taking his votes for granted, he tried to contact every Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to ask for their support. Out of courtesy, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> waited to make the calls this time until <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> last Wednesday formally announced his resignation _ even though <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> knew for months that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was thinking of stepping down. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> met Monday with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to discuss their transition. Although <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was resigning his speakership effective today, he plans to remain in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> until later this month. Democrats plan to meet next week to fill their other leadership vacancies _ <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s post of majority leader and <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s No. 3 job of majority whip. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was favored over Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to succeed <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as majority leader. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully last year for the Democratic presidential nomination, is considered the favorite to succeed <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> is a popular member of the more conservative wing of the party. The whip's race is a contest among four already-powerful <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats: <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the chief deputy whip; <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a leading member of the Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> voters cast ballots in a primary today with four Republicans running neck and neck for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> mantle of departing two-term Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. Voters also decided on a new mayor in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and the fate of the <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The Election Day maxim of `` every vote counts'' has more validity than usual, said one campaigner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s Republican primary. `` You always say that because it's always true, but this race looks to be extraordinarily close,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pintak </PERSON>, campaign manager for Assembly Speaker and Republican hopeful <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> and the three other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> frontrunners _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, former Attorney General <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> _ scrambled around the state Monday making final pleas to voters at train stations, senior citizen centers and shipping centers. A fifth major <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate, state Sen. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON>, has lagged in the polls and in fund-raising. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates spent an estimated $ 7 million on television advertisements alone. The popular <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who is barred by law from seeking a third straight four-year term, has made no endorsement. There has been little suspense in the Democratic primary, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> enjoying a large lead in the polls over Assemblyman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, voters were deciding whether the problem-plagued Rancho Seco plant should be closed. A majority of the board members of the utility district say they will abide by the results of the non-binding vote. Critics say the 15-year-old facility is unsafe and are angry at rising utility bills and a $ 400 million repair bill after a 1985 overcooling accident. Supporters say the plant's bad days are over now that it has been overhauled and has new managers. In <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, state Rep. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditto </PERSON>, a Democrat, faced only token opposition from three challengers in the mayoral election. Ditto upset incumbent <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Danks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the May 16 primary and was opposed by Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonelli </PERSON> and independents <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Godbolt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Danks </PERSON> was mayor for 12 years.

<HEAD>Maximum Sentences Given To Two Convicted In Policeman's Murder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two narcotics dealers who murdered a rookie policeman _ allegedly on orders from a drug lord _ were sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in prison today as more than 100 police officers cheered. A third dealer received the same sentence May 16 for his role in the 1988 death of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, whose slaying outside the home of a drug witness became an issue in the White House campaign and a battle cry for law enforcement. Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demakos </PERSON>, in sentencing <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> and <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, recommended that neither receive parole. Neither Cobb, 25, nor <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 20, addressed the judge. <PERSON> Demakos </PERSON> promised, as he did at the sentencing of co-defendant <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, that his last act as a judge would be to remind the parole board of his recommendation. He labeled the pair `` unfit to live in society.'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, 22, was shot five times in the head at close range while he sat in a patrol car guarding the home of a drug witness. Prosecutors charged that the officer was killed on orders from alleged drug lord <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> `` Pappy'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> in retaliation for his jailing on a weapons charge. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> has not been charged in the slaying and has denied involvement. The slaying gained widespread attention during the White House campaign when <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, presented his son's badge to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying he supported him because of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support of the death penalty. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a former police officer, left the courtroom without comment today. The sentencing of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> was postponed last month while prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to persuade the two to provide evidence against <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. A fourth defendant, alleged triggerman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McClary </PERSON>, is on trial in the slaying.

 Mourners bewailing the death of Iranian patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> brought west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to a standstill today, but did not stop Christians and Syrians from exchanging salvos of shellfire. Police said four Christian and five Druse Moslem civilians were wounded in sporadic overnight shelling duels that ended before dawn. In an unrelated incident, gunmen shot and killed a Palestinian employee of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> early today, police said. A police spokesman said <PERSON> Nafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdeh </PERSON> `` died instantly and the gunmen sped away in a green <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> was notified.'' He gave no other details. No comment was available immediately from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency, which cares for Palestinian refugees in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Black flags and posters of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> decorated Shiite Moslem districts of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its southern slums. The 86-year-old Iranian patriarch died on Saturday of a heart attack in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> after surgery for internal bleeding. Lebanese cranked up generators to watch <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s funeral broadcast live by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, run by right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias. Three months of Syrian-Christian clashes have caused chronic power shortages. Shiite mosques blared verses from the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, as thousands of mourners flooded the Iranian Embassy to deliver condolences. Cars mounted with loudspeakers drove the streets urging businesses to close. `` Close! Close!'' shouted a bearded man from a car that flew the Iranian flag and blared verses from the Koran as he drove across west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> commercial thoroughfare. `` Sure, sure,'' muttered a grocer, lowering his shutter. Banks and other private businesses that opened after observing a one-day closure also shut down again.

<HEAD>Medical Branch to Halt Cosmetic Surgery for Prison Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> medical school says it will put stricter limits on plastic surgery on inmates, two years after the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> banned frivolous cosmetic surgery at taxpayer expense. `` It is our intent to ` limit down' so that we can stay out of trouble with everybody,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>, vice president for hospital affairs. `` We are going to try to please the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, I can tell you that.'' A rider to prison appropriations bills passed in 1987 and this year prohibits use of state money for cosmetic surgery on prisoners unless they are disfigured and suffer psychological problems because of it. The university, a state school, operates a 120-bed prison hospital in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> reported two months ago that hundreds of prisoners over the years have gotten facelifts, liposuction _ fat removal _ and other cosmetic surgery. The article quoted a 59-year-old inmate who received face and brow lifts and liposuction as saying, `` I think it will help my attitude and feeling about myself when I go back to the free world.'' School officials were quoted as saying that the practice helps surgeons perfect their skills and improves prisoners' outlook. A prison policy that took effect April 28 requires that requests for cosmetic surgery be approved by the deputy director for medical services in the prison system and a university doctor, officials said. In the past, prison psychiatrists could recommend the surgery. <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said he was unaware of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s limit on cosmetic surgery until contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynaugh </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We definitely were aware of that rider and have not violated it.'' `` When my inmates check into that hospital, I have no control of anything except security. I do n't control any medical practices in that hospital,'' <PERSON> Lynaugh </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The timing could n't have been better: talent and technology coincided beautifully at the end of the 19th century for controversial artist <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON>. Though little trained in art and just 25 when he died of tuberculosis in 1898, the drawings <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON> made the last six years of his life are credited with influencing such giants of 20th-century art as <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Klee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edvard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON>'s black and white drawings, usually for book or magazine illustrations, were printed _ when not suppressed _ through the then new photo-mechanical reproduction process, said <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a curatorial associate at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. The reproductions were faithful to the drawings and cost less than those carved into wood blocks by craftsmen rather than the artist. The Fogg has more than 50 of the drawings, which were donated by two alumni. They constitute the most important collection of the artist's work outside <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said Fogg Curator of Drawings <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. For the first time in six years the drawings are on public display, and for the first time in more than a dozen years, they are together in one exhibit. And since the drawings are on paper, making them delicate and sensitive to light, they can be exhibited only briefly, museum officials said. They will be shown at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s Sackler Museum through July 9 together with other material, including books illustrated by <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON>, loaned by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. Some of the drawings are overtly erotic; others have touches typical of his mischief. He usually started his drawings with pencil and perfected them with ink, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. In some, he used graphite. His acquaintances included the playwright <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON> became a sensation with his illustrations for <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>'s play, `` Salome,'' published in 1894 The illustraions were `` described variously as having nothing to do with the play and everything to do with it,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. Included in the Fogg exhibit are two drawings intended for the book but suppressed from publication. The show also includes work done for a reprint of <PERSON> Malory </PERSON>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Arthur </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s `` Volpone,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>'s `` The Rape of the Lock,'' Aristophanes' `` Lysistrata,'' and for the periodicals, The Yellow Book and The Savoy. Drawings for `` Bon-Mots,'' a collection of witticisms are `` sort of elaborate doodles ... some quite grotesque,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. A voracious reader, <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON> sometimes exchanged drawings for books, and it was through this that his career was launched when he was chosen to illustrate `` Le Morte d'Arthur.'' He was 20. Some drawings resemble posters and advertisements. `` He was of his time, and he was not trying to create a lyrical past,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON> began writing an erotic novel, but never completed it. He became a Roman Catholic the year before he died, and on his death bed asked that some of his drawings be destroyed. The publisher who had them did not. The Fogg's collection came from alumni who had different reasons for collecting <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON>'s work. <PERSON> Grenville </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winthrop </PERSON>, who was graduated in 1889 and who descended from the first governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, bequeathed to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> 23 original <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON> drawings among more than 3,700 art objects. <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>, class of 1913 and onetime editor and part-owner of the literary review The Dial, had more than 30 drawings that became the <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON>'s when he died. <PERSON> Winthrop </PERSON> liked the lines and design of <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON>'s work; Thayer liked the daring subject matter, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Music Helped Spanish Tenor Live</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As the Spanish tenor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> lay in a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> hospital battling leukemia, music helped him to get through the ordeal. Music, he says, `` has this spiritual strength.'' `` Every day, I was listening to music with a Walkman in my sterilized room. One of the pieces _ I had to hear it every day _ was <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON>'s ` Piano Concerto No. 2.' I was listening to many versions of it, also <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON> playing it himself,'' said <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> who gave a recital at <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> on May 25, his first appearance in more than two years. `` The most important thing for me was to save my life. All the rest came after this,'' he said. <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON>' leukemia is now in remission. `` Now I'm not under any kind of treatment. I have a routine blood test once a month, that's all I travel around, I play some sports, I eat anything, drink anything. There are no limitations in my life.'' He makes long-range plans, including a co-production next year between several <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> networks on the great opera singer <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>. Audiences are delighted as the 42-year-old <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> makes his `` comeback'' recitals. He performed last July before 150,000 in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, and also appeared in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and in other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities. This spring he was in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In February, he recorded Saint-Saens' `` Samson et Dalila'' and since has recorded <PERSON> Halevy </PERSON>'s `` La Juive'' for <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>. In July, he'll return to opera, where he made his fame, singing in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Cherubini </PERSON>'s `` Medea'' with soprano <PERSON> Montserrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> is ranked as one the top tenors in the world. But he was often taken to task for vocal roughness, believed to be caused by singing too often and singing roles too heavy for his voice, so that he had to press for volume. `` Before, my career was the most important thing in my life,'' he said. `` Like anybody who succeeds, I had to fight a lot and have a lot of discipline. Now, I'm more interested to have the opportunity to sing on stage again and communicate with people through my voice.'' <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> thinks his voice is essentially the same, but rested. `` I was lying in a hospital for nine months. It was a hard period. But my vocal chords were resting. Thank God all the therapy and treatments and radiation did not affect my vocal chords or mucous membranes. `` Maybe as a singer I'm a little deeper or more mature. There is a parallel between the artist and the human being.'' He plans to include more lyrical roles in my repertoire as he gets back to work. `` What is going to change for sure is the rhythm of my career. I do n't plan to sing more than three or four times in one month and to have, if possible, a month of holiday every year. `` I'm going to enjoy not only my professional life, that is what I did for 17 years, but to enjoy also the human side of my life more than before,'' he said. <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> has two children, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, 10. `` I do n't regret at all that I concentrated so much on my profession. I had a wonderful life.'' <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON>, who sang the part of <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> on the `` West Side Story'' record conducted by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, made the soundtrack for a `` La Boheme'' film in May 1987. That was when he fell ill. The diagnosis was acute lymphocytic leukemia. His doctors in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> recommended that he go to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> also appealed to <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> because he felt he would be less of a media event there than in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The treatment was bone marrow transplant. They took out my bone marrow, treated it and gave it back to my body. This is a revolutionary treatment which needs more and more research,'' he said. To this end, the singer founded the <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carreras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leukemia </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is unbelievable the thousands of letters, messages, telegrams, phone calls,'' he said. `` This really touched me so much. I think that gave me even more the strength to fight.'' His next opera appearance after `` Medea'' will be in a new opera about <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, which was postponed when he became sick. Now he'll sing the title role in September in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> `` After this, I think I will go back to opera in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, Covent Garden, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> and the Metropolitan Opera.'' His time will be divided three ways, <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> said, among `` singing new roles, new recitals, new recordings; free time _ pleasure, sports, friends; and the foundation _ meetings, appointments, traveling, besides all the performances I give to benefit the foundation. I have to tell you my life is quite busy even though I sing less. `` I do everything with such a joy, you can not imagine.''

 The five men and one woman have shared the boarded-up <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> brownstone since 1983, their lives devoted to drugs and crime. `` We're closer to each other than to our families,'' says <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>, a crack addict who is undergoing methadone treatment to help fight heroin addiction. `` We survive because we take care of each other.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 33, is the group leader. Hooked on heroin when he was 11, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> native has been in and out of methadone programs since he was 18. The methadone blocks his appetite for heroin, but smoking crack, a concentrated cocaine crystal, now satisfies his cravings for a high. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> are crack addicts, too. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> has a heroin habit. The commune members have been evicted four times from the building, which <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s parents owned until the city seized it for back taxes. The roof leaks and the ceilings are falling in. The dank hallway reeks of urine. A rotting staircase leads to the second-floor living area. A single bulb illuminates a semicircle of mattresses that are beds by night and sofas by day. Old clothing is stuffed in plastic bags or piled in corners. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s pit bull, Coco, is kept chained to a radiator, a deterrent to unwanted visitors. There is no heat or running water. The group members take sponge baths using buckets filled with water taken from a hydrant outside. A plastic pail is their toilet; it is emptied each morning into a sewer pipe out on the street. Each member is responsible for raising the $ 1,000 a week it takes to keep the group's drug habit satisfied. They're willing to talk about their lives and crimes, they say, because they have nothing to lose. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> breaks into subway turnstiles and steals tokens. Each token is worth $ 1 to a subway rider; newsstand operators and convenience store owners in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> pay him $ 75 for 100 tokens. `` It's a victimless crime. -LRB- We're -RRB- not hurting anybody. -LRB- We're -RRB- taking back a little of what -LRB- we -RRB- gave the city,'' he says. But his crimes are n't always victimless. `` When we ran out of money we've looked at each other and said, ` Let's go hold up a taxi cab driver.' And we did.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> also deals crack. He pays $ 5 for a vial that holds less than a quarter-teaspoon and sells it for $ 10. Some of his regular customers include a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> gas station owner, a stockbroker, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> free-lance artist, a former <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> motorman and a <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> customer service representative. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> steals copper wire from <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> commuter railroad yards and sells it as scrap. He also strips copper wiring and pipes from abandoned refrigerators and buildings, collects abandoned mattresses and recycles bundles of unsold newspapers. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> describes himself as a `` real, real, real good thief.'' He shoplifts, specializing in videotapes, electronic goods, medicines and cigarettes. `` I take anything that ai n't nailed down.'' <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>'s monthly welfare check goes for crack. `` The day her welfare check comes in we lay in bed all day getting high,'' says <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. The group is not unaware of their condition. `` We're living like animals,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> says. Since their most recent eviction, in February, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has picked out two abandoned buildings in the neighborhood in better condition that they can move into. In addition, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> expects to begin receiving her late husband's Social Security benefits He was a heroin addict who died in December. Their 15-year-old son is in her parents' custody. She and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> have been thinking of using the benefits to rent an apartment to escape their squalid lifestyle. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> is convinced he can break his crack addiction and re-enter the mainstream. He has moved into a shelter for homeless men and says, `` I'll be better in a few months, looking for a job.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is n't so hopeful for himself and the others. `` Some of us are beyond being saved. All of us somewhere in the back of our mind have a death wish. We just do n't have the courage to do it outright.''

<TEXT>
 Dozens of riot police fired tear gas to disperse Palestinians attending the funeral of a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official today, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops reportedly shot dead an Arab in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army said it had no information on the clash in the village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lahiya </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said one Palestinian was killed and two were wounded, one seriously. Palestinian reporters said the clash broke out after troops tried to reimpose a curfew on the village of 13,000 after distributing new, computerized identity cards to residents. Arab doctors identified the dead man as <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON>, 22, and said he was shot in the head. The death raised to 507 the number of Palestinians killed in the 18-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Twenty-two Israelis have also died. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, about 2,000 mourners waved outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags at the funeral of <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>, 48, a senior figure in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON> died on Sunday. He spent 21 years in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jails for his role in a 1968 guerrilla raid and had become a symbol for Palestinians held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 20 Palestinians were detained following a stone-throwing protest that broke out after the funeral, which included a three-hour procession through Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Reporters at the scene watched police fire tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who left the funeral shouting, `` We are the fedayeen,'' or guerrillas in Arabic. Mourners vowed to increase their opposition to the occupation and carried signs saying: `` Escalating the <ORGANIZATION> Intefadeh </ORGANIZATION> will redeem <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>'s blood.'' Intefadeh is Arabic for uprising. Two Israeli-Arab legislators led the procession. One of them, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahab </PERSON> <PERSON> Daroushe </PERSON>, told the mourners after <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>'s body was lowered into the grave: `` In spite of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s arrogance, the intefadeh will be victorious.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Palestinian shop keepers closed their doors to mourn <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>. The army maintained a curfew in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for a third straight day and began issuing computerized identity cards that Palestinians will be required to carry to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Arabs detained for security reasons or convicted of serious crimes will be denied the entry permits. The restrictions are designed to exert economic pressure on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. About 50,000 Gazans work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and there is little employment in the coastal strip. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> told 500 American Jews visiting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> he was surprised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials on Thursday for a third round of talks since the dialogue began in December. Everything the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government does to `` give the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> status and legitimization is counterproductive and can not possibly help <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace initiative,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. Also today, police said Mayor <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> of the Jewish <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of Ariel apparently did not break the law when he ordered Arab laborers to wear badges identifying them as `` alien workers.'' The police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, would not elaborate. The investigation will continue, he said. <PERSON> Nachmann </PERSON> backed down after the decision sparked widespread criticism and raised comparisons to the yellow Stars of <PERSON> David </PERSON> that Jews were forced to wear in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Drodwill </PERSON> stood in cemetery overlooking the sea on Tuesday, remembering the fellow soldiers who fought and died there to free <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from Nazi tyranny. `` It's like I'm reliving the war all over again, there are so many memories,'' said the war veteran from <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who had not been back to the <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> coast since the end of World War II. About 1,000 people gathered by the reflecting pool at the American military cemetery at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the 45th anniversary of the invasion. Among them was a large group of gray-haired veterans from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The ceremony at the cemetery was one of several over three days by British, Canadian, French and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> groups to mark Tuesday's anniversary At <LOCATION> Bayeux </LOCATION>, Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> dedicated a stained-glass window in the cathedral in honor of the fallen soldiers. Canadian Veterans Affairs Minister <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrithew </PERSON> joined in commemorations at the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> cemetery at <PERSON> Beny </PERSON> sur Mer. <PERSON> Drodwill </PERSON> was in a group of 225 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> who just after dawn on June 6, 1944, scaled the 9-story high cliff at Point du Hoc on <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> using grappling hooks and ladders to reach the big German guns above. <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> soldiers fired straight down on them, cutting the ropes to send many Rangers plummeting to their deaths. `` I could n't sleep last night, I kept thinking of the beach,'' said <PERSON> Drodwill </PERSON>, who lost four men under his command during the assault. Surrounded by a group of veteran <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Drodwill </PERSON> cried softly as a single bugle played taps, the melancholy notes lofting over the manicured green lawn lined with 9,368 white marble crosses. The sun emerged and warmed the crowd, damp from standing in heavy morning showers. A military band played the Star Spangled Banner and the Marseillaise. Four F-16s flew low over the sparkling English Channel and the cemetery that overlooks a long, curving beach where American troops stormed ashore to drive back German forces in what was the beginning of the end of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s tyranny. The Germans, in trenches and concrete bunkers perched on the bluff 150 feet above the beach, shot at the wide-open <ORGANIZATION> Yanks </ORGANIZATION> as they struggled onto the beach, stumbling knee-deep, hip-deep, neck-deep through the surf, some of them shot to death before ever touching shore. `` I lost one in the water,'' said <PERSON> Drodwill </PERSON>, 68. `` He went down under the weight of his gear and never came up.'' The dead and wounded were sprawled everywhere, their blood soaking into the sand. `` Some of my men fell, but there were so many others, all around me, all Americans, all young. That's the picture in my head I ca n't get rid of,'' <PERSON> Drodwill </PERSON> said Up and down a 50-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> coast, 180,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British and Canadian soldiers battled on <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, Gold, <PERSON> Juno </PERSON> and Sword Beaches in operation Overlord, the largest amphibious operation in history. With reinforcements, the assault force numbered 3 million men. Compared to the relatively light American casualties at <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> was the roughest of the fighting. It took all day for the 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions to cross 250 yards of sand and rock and climb onto the bluff where the 172-acre military cemetery now stands as a memorial to those who fought and died. `` I do n't usually cry,'' <PERSON> Drodwill </PERSON> said. `` Maybe this trip will help soften the memory.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, amid praise for Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s efforts to aid the Afghan resistance, pledged today to join her in exploring `` any serious avenue'' to a political solution to the bloody conflict in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Prime Minister <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and I reviewed the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. ... We agreed ... that the job is not done,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the Afghan rebels' struggle to topple the Marxist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The two leaders met for an hour with the Afghan situation the centerpiece of their discussions. Although many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had expected the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime to fall shortly after the withdrawl of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops in February, the rebel forces have been unable to topple the regime of <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. That has forced the administration to reconsider its strategy in the troubled region. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the third largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, has cooperated closely with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in aiding the Afghan rebel effort to topple the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had `` discussed ways to encourage a political solution in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that will lead to a non-aligned, representative government ... to replace the illegitimate regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will continue to explore any serious avenue towards this end.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in her departure remarks, called her talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` instructive and fruitful,'' adding in regards to the Afghan situation, `` we are in complete accord with future policies.'' `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> remains fully committed ot a politcal solution'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, she said. Earlier, the two leaders exchanged warm remarks during the formal welcoming ceremony, held under leaden gray skies on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> of the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged to `` chart new ways to strengthen old bonds'' with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, greeting Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> as the living symbol of the renewal of democracy in her strategic nation. `` The day of the dictator is over,'' declared Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. The president noted that they are both new in their posts. `` Let us craft new ideas, new initiative to meet the challeges of a changing world,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He described Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> as `` a living symmbol of those who risk all and sacrifice much so that others might know democracy and freedom.'' Attired in a traditional white shawl, tunic and pants, the prime minister replied that she came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to begin `` discussions of a new relationship'' as both nations work to meet the `` new challenges -LRB- that -RRB- confront us in the closing but complex phase of the Afghan war.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering the sale of 60 F-16 fighter jets to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> at a cost of $ 1.4 billion, but the two leaders made no mention of any such agreement in their welcoming remarks. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention the ongoing Afghan rebel effort in his initial remarks, he repeatedly praised Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s battle to return her nation to democratic rule. She assumed her duties six months ago following her party's victory in national elections. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said the two nations have `` stood together as partners'' in the attempt to restore freedom and independence to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Our countries have developed a vital security relationship and a major program of economic cooperation. This has enabled <LOCATION> Pakkistan </LOCATION> to work with confidence for peace in our region,'' she said. `` It was not so long ago that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was a dictatorship and I was in prison. But, as you said Mr. President, giving heart to all those living under tyrany, the day of the dictator is over,'' she said. After the welcoming ceremony and a meeting in the Oval Office, Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was to be the guest of honor at a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> luncheon hosted by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. A White House state dinner was planned this evening following meetings Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had scheduled at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. During her two-day stay, agreements in the areas of narcotics control, housing and education are to be signed. Also on the agenda is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, for which the administration has requested $ 380 million in economic assistance and $ 240 million in military transfers for the next fiscal year. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is the third largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. But the principal focus of attention of her visit will be the unending civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a conflict in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have cooperated for years. Although the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> completed the withdrawal of its forces in February, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is still bearing the burden of 3 million Afghan refugees as fighting continues between the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the Afghan rebels. The insurgents have been using <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> as a launching pad for attacks inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In recent interviews, Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has indicated a desire for a political settlement. But she accepts the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that any such agreement should not include <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s current leader, <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>, whose forces have proved remarkably resilient in the face of predictions his government would collapse following the Soviet withdrawal. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, <PERSON> ex-Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader turned ambitious freshman legislator, riled some people with his election, but during his first regular lawmaking session he has hardly made a dent in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> government. With the 1989 general session nearing its end, none of his bills has made it through the legislative process. Only one was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and it is pending in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. `` Some of my legislation's gone through. I mean I'm only a two-month freshman legislator and I think I've done quite well,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. It's not unusual for a newcomer to have difficulty getting legislation passed. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> had a similar experience last year. `` The major difference is <PERSON> David </PERSON> is sort of a one-issue type of guy. He's interested in the racial issue,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said. The legislative session could end as early as this weekend. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 38, was elected in February to represent a nearly all-white district in suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> after a `` no-tax'' campaign that focused on `` civil rights'' for everyone _ including whites. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is a former grand wizard of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, which he left in 1980 in a dispute with a rival faction. He then formed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which he still heads. He ran for president in 1988, first as a Democrat and then on the <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ticket. He registered as a Republican days before entering the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> race, which he won by 227 votes in a runoff with a long-time Republican who was endorsed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> called for <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>'s censure as a charlatan after the election. A challenge to his seating in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> fizzled when 69 of 102 lawmakers backed him. Several representatives said they were inundated with calls from constituents across the state insisting that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> be seated. When the regular session began in April, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> offered nine bills which would, among other things, have eliminated affirmative action and minority set asides and required drug testing for housing project residents and welfare recipients. One Duke bill is dead on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. One is pending in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. A third was gutted in committee and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, where it was shelved. Six languish in House committees and are not expected to get out. Seated at one end of the back row of desks, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is not one of the plentiful lower chamber gadflies. He rarely goes to the microphone to speak on others' bills. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s legislation seems to be a target for procedural torpedoes, including one fired by Rep. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Landrieu </PERSON>, a young white legislator whose district includes a housing project. <PERSON> Landrieu </PERSON> got the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to table <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s bill to scrap affirmative action laws. `` It was a short <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and they just happened to get two switch votes which made a difference on that particular vote,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` What <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Landrieu </PERSON> did is he robbed the people of the right to hear the points of view and really have equal rights on this matter. We must have equal rights in this state for everybody.'' Another Duke bill, to deny welfare benefits to drug users by requiring them to be tested, was weakened in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee to affect only welfare recipients convicted of drug crimes. It is awaiting debate by the full House. The bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee would require teen-agers to pass drug tests to get driver's licenses, but it was gutted by amendments offered by a black legislator, Rep. C.D. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` It's a unique situation. He's sort of an internationally known fellow and that puts added pressure on him ... to get a lot accomplished,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said. `` I told him he could work within the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> _ ` We'll give you a chance or you can go off and set your agenda.' He's kind of gone off on his own.'' But <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said he believes his presence has made a difference. `` I think I've pushed the whole House of Representatives more to the issues of the middle class and more to the issues of my agenda, my campaign agenda, which is equal rights for all and reform of the welfare system,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` I think we're moving along quite well.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was asked Tuesday to investigate a grain company with possible ties to a fugitive businessman in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and whether the business had properly received $ 65 million in export subsidies. The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., called for the review of <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss-based company with an office in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and payments it received through the export enhancement program <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> needs to focus on the company's connections to <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, who renounced his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship and fled to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in 1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion, racketeering, mail and wire fraud. `` While I am disturbed that a company whose main operations lie outside of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can establish but a nominal onshore presence and qualify to receive <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> bonuses, as appears to be the case with <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION>, I am truly shocked that a fugitive from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justice can benefit from a program funded by taxpayer dollars,'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said in a letter to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. Under the export enhancement program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, under secretary for international affairs and commodity programs, said he had not seen the congressman's letter but that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had already started `` checking through what the connections are'' between <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>. He said the review was started to answer questions raised by <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> about <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> at a subcommittee hearing in April. An official of <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Church </PERSON>, declined comment about the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> review and would not provide any information about the company. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, in his letter, said `` an unmistakable line of ownership, control and profit runs from'' <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> through a series of subsidiary arrangements. He asked that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> had qualified for the export subsidy program and whether department eligibility guidelines need to be changed to close any possible loopholes used by <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe that especially in this case, the department should take special care to determine whether <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s benefit from the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> program, through <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION>, was camouflaged through subsidiary arrangements with other business entities he owns and controls,'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> wrote. `` In short, has <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> complied with the letter of the law but flouted its spirit?'' <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> has the same telephone number as <ORGANIZATION> Clarendon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Marc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. A.G. of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> The two companies settled a federal tax evasion case in 1984 by pleading guilty and agreeing to pay more than $ 200 million in back taxes, fines and other penalties. Criminal charges against <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> were unaffected by the settlement. The government alleged that <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and his commodity-trading empire cheated the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> out of millions of dollars in taxes through a series of illegal oil transactions among Rich-controlled companies. According to <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> has received about $ 65 million worth of subsidies through <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, including about $ 250,000 for a recent wheat sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Last month, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approved use of the subsidy program for the sale of 1.5 million tons of wheat to the Soviets. <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> handled at least 30,000 tons of the initial part of the wheat deal. Subsidies averaged $ 8.46 per ton for <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> and four other companies, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>.

 Solidarity said today that despite its overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections it will not accept the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to join a governing coalition. In a conciliatory move, however, the free trade union movement offered to stand by the agreement made with authorities in April and allow the party the two-thirds majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful lower house Up to 35 of those seats may be vacant because high party and government officials such as Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> appeared to have been defeated in Sunday's vote despite running unopposed. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> will offer his resignation and that of his Cabinet when the new parliament convenes in June, said deputy government spokesman <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON>. Voters disgruntled by the Communists' more than 40 years of authoritarian rule and mismanagement of the economy gave few of the high-ranking officials the majority needed to gain seats. Solidarity won an overwhelming majority of seats to the new 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and virtually all the 161 seats it was permitted in the lower house, or <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, according to unofficial returns. A handful of seats may be decided in runoffs on June 18. On Monday, the party conceded defeat in what was <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most democratic balloting in more than four decades, but fears were raised that the outcome could precipitate a new political crisis. The result gave an opposition group in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> control of a freely chosen chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since the postwar Communist takeover. The Communists have urged Solidarity to join a governing coalition, an arrangement unprecedented in the Soviet bloc. `` We can not do reforms by ourselves. ... We need each other,'' <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON> said today. He declined to be specific, saying such questions would have to wait until the new parliament is seated. At a news conference today, Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said the union considers itself bound by the April accords in which it agreed to give the government a majority in the 460-member <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> _ 299 seats. Authorities should thus be allowed to fill the vacant seats as they please, he said. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> ruled out a formal governing coalition: `` All candidates for deputy and senator stated that they will enter the Sejm or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as the opposition. That was made very clear.'' But he said that did not rule out future `` joint actions and joint decisions'' to solve specific problems. Senior Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> told reporters the union was ready to act jointly with the government to work for reform. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> praised Monday's statement by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON>, who acknowledged the party's electoral defeat. `` It was a very important statement because it shows that the government and the party are committed to a peaceful transition from the present political situation to a more democratic situation,'' he said. Solidarity wants totally free elections in four years, without any pre-reserved seats for either side. Jubilant union supporters celebrated their election win with Russian champagne into the night Monday at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> campaign headquarters. Although final official results were not expected until midweek, voters rejected government-backed candidates nearly everywhere. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, on Friday suggested a post-election `` grand coalition,'' though no specific explanations have been given of what he intended. Solidarity's victory was shocking in its proportions for the authorities. Leading officials likely failing to win the necessary votes for a seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> include Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and eight of the ruling Politburo's 17 members, including No. 2 <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON>. Though rejected, the government officials are allowed to keep their posts. In his dramatic concession of defeat Monday, <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> acknowledged on television a `` decided majority'' for Solidarity and appealed for calm. With or without a formal coalition of Solidarity and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership that long sought to crush it, it appeared certain the two would have to cooperate. The government needs Solidarity if it is to end a protracted economic crisis that includes 80 percent inflation that last year touched off a series of crippling strikes. The country has a $ 39 billion foreign debt. The Solidarity-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will have veto power over all legislation, and could only be overridden by a two-thirds majority in the Sejm. But with at best a 65 percent majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies would need at least 10 Solidarity votes in the lower house to override a veto. The Sejm and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are required to convene after June 18 to elect the president, a new office the Communists had hoped to award to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> through a majority in the Sejm.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> art dealer testified today that <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> `` left no stone unturned'' in her attempt last summer to learn whether four sixth-century Christian mosaics offered for sale were stolen. `` I think her inquiry met the best professional standards,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmerich </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmerich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s ownership of the mosaics is being challenged by the Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, who claim the works were stolen from a church in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and smuggled out of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island nation. They are asking a federal judge to order the suburban <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> dealer to return the mosaics. On Monday, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> testified she believed the man who sold her the four mosaics obtained them legally. She also said she made inquiries around the world to see if any claims had been made against the art. <PERSON> Emmerich </PERSON>, a witness for <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, said in a videotaped deposition that comparing her with international dealers would be like comparing `` the corner store to <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s.'' But he said her investigation of the mosaics before she purchased them was as complete as any more-experienced dealer would have made. `` I could n't have expected more. She left no stone unturned,'' he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> contacted by telephone, is considered the most complete and readily available source on stolen artwork. The mosaics, which are believed to date to 525 A.D., depict <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as an adolescent, the apostles <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and an archangel. They are among only a handful of icons surviving from the first centuries of Christianity. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> on Monday testified she believed <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dikmen </PERSON>, who sold her the mosaics, had been an archaeologist for the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. She said she did not know the breakaway government is not recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She said she was told `` that in the process of his other duties, he had found these pieces, that he had been able to make application to acquire them and that had subsequently been granted by the government.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> testified she called customs officials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and found no claims against the mosaics. She said she also called <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which keeps an inventory of stolen art. She did not ask <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> if the mosaics were stolen, only whether any treaties would prevent her from bringing them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and was told no, she testified. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said she asked the art foundation whether it had any record of the mosaics being reported stolen and was told no. <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> and several other international art groups did have reports that the mosaics were stolen. On cross-examination by attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said she could not recall the names of the people she talked to.

 A house on <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s west side apparently is getting no R-E-S-P-E-C-T from singer <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. The two-story brick home, deeded to the singer in 1972 by her then-husband <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, was condemned last year by the city. Now, the yard is overgrown and littered with fliers, and there is a hole in the screen door. `` We live in a nice neighborhood, but <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> does n't care about us,'' said <PERSON> Theodora </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a neighbor behind the house <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, could n't be reached for comment.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A scientific test that has found growing use in court to identify crime suspects through genetic patterns in body cells will be challenged this week in the appeal of a man who faces four death sentences. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 26, a former resident of a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> halfway house, was the first defendant in a serial-murder case in the nation to be confronted with so-called `` DNA fingerprinting'' evidence at his trials. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic genetic material found in each cell of the human body and forms the blueprint for each individual. Everyone's DNA pattern is believed to be unique, with the exception of identical twins. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> was convicted and sentenced to death in separate trials last year for the rape-murders of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. This year, he was convicted and sentenced to die in two other cases, the rape-murders of Dr. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellams </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cho </PERSON>, 15, of <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. All four victims were bound and strangled by an assailant who broke into their homes through a window. In each case, DNA from a sample of semen found at the crime scene was compared to DNA patterns in <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION>'s blood cells. The results linked him to the murders. The genetic evidence was challenged by defense lawyers at <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION>'s trials, but the judges allowed the test results in each case. Although the DNA test, developed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, is relatively new, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrer </PERSON>, a spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, said courts are likely to uphold such a test if it is determined to be reliable. At <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION>'s trial for the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> murder, experts testified that the DNA patterns found in the defendant's blood and in the semen sample found with the victim matched. The odds of finding such a match randomly was one in 705 million, they testified. But <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everhart </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> attorney who represented <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION> in the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> killing, argued that the DNA procedure is too unproved to be relied upon exclusively, as it was in that and the other cases, to put the defendant at the scene of the crime. Defense lawyers argued that the procedure's reliability may come into question in future research on forensic evidence. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear challenges to the DNA evidence and other issues that arose in <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION>'s trials for the <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> murders. The appeals went to the high court on automatic review, a standard procedure when anyone is sentenced to execution in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>'s appeals in the Hellams and <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> murders will be heard later. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> also was linked to a fifth murder. But <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> would not be charged in that slaying because DNA testing of the aging evidence was inconclusive. Another man, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, was sentenced to a 35-year prison term for that killing after pleading guilty to first-degree murder but was pardoned by Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> when new evidence came to light.

<HEAD>Mock Invasion Of Duluth Beach Canceled After Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has canceled plans for an amphibious assault on a <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> beach during a goodwill recruiting visit this summer because of protests by peace activists, city council members and others. Opponents had threatened to meet the Marine landing force on the beach with an army of protesters. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said it has n't canceled mock landings at five other <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> cities as part of a 21-city Great Lakes recruiting tour. `` As far as I know, <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> is the only place in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> where we've met opposition,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiebing </PERSON>. He said the USS Boulder still will dock in <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> on July 21 so people can tour the ship. `` I spent a horrible weekend watching the news from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It's nice to know we can communicate with our military,'' said <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> Not everyone was happy. `` There was more opposition to this than the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Duluth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which helped organize the event. He said the landing would have been a `` great opportunity for us to sell the fact that <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> has seven miles of beautiful beach.'' Original plans called for 200 Marines in amphibious tanks to storm ashore and `` capture'' a beach house on <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, a narrow strip of land that separates <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION>. But at least a dozen religious and peace groups said such an exercise glorified violence and war and was not an appropriate way to recruit the city's young people, and they planned a group of protesters to defend the beach. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said it was not swayed, but relented after <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> telephoned some top <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials and Council Member <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON> threatened to introduce a resolution opposing the use of the beach for the landing. `` The resolution would say there are a number of ordinances that prohibit such things as the use of firearms or motorized vehicles from the beach,'' said <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON>. `` They probably just assumed a permit would n't be necessary. The military usually does n't apply for a permit to storm beaches,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. Other cities where amphibious landings are scheduled are <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; Erie, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.

 `` Onion Field'' police killer <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was in jail without bail Tuesday on charges of terrorizing a woman, the latest in a string of run-ins with the law since he was paroled in 1982. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 58, was being held for investigation of false imprisonment, attempted rape and assault with a deadly weapon, police said Tuesday. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> were convicted of kidnapping two <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> policemen in March 1963 and driving them to an onion field south of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> shot one officer to death and wounded his partner. The crime was recounted in former <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON>'s best-selling novel, `` The Onion Field,'' which was made into a movie. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> were twice sentenced to death for the killing, but the sentences were overturned on appeal. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was paroled in February 1982 after serving 19 years at Soledad Correctional Facility. A few months later, he was back in prison for six months after failing a drug test and not telling his parole officer he was leaving the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. Two years later, he was convicted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> of selling heroin while on parole and was sentenced to five years in prison.

 Americans gave $ 104 billion to charity last year, almost 7 percent more than 1987 and 1.8 percent ahead of the inflation rate, according to a report Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund-Raising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION>. The association, which represents fund-raising counseling firms, said the total was up $ 6.55 billion over 1987, breaking the $ 100 billion mark for the first time. Individuals provided about $ 87 billion, foundations $ 6 billion and businesses $ 4.8 billion. Bequests _ gifts willed by the deceased _ amounted to $ 6.8 billion. Religious institutions and causes received the largest share of donations, $ 48 billion, with education, health and human services and cultural organizations getting most of the balance. The association attributed the increase in giving to a 7.5 percent increase in personal income as well as a stronger stock market in the last two months of 1988.

<TEXT>
 Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford vetoed a $ 3.2 billion budget from the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and demanded that Democrats get a greater say. The veto, unprecedented in state history, came Monday on the 148th day of what was supposed to be a 100-day session and left the state without a spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Republican legislative leaders agreed to meet with Democrats and said they would suspend most other business for the week. Conservative lawmakers said the veto might backfire on Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> if it prompted them to reopen budgets for agencies for which she already had gotten what she wanted. In a radio address, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan was at least $ 165 million out of balance, `` does not meet or adequately fund our moral and legal obligations'' and `` undermines the economic future of the state by defaulting on investments that need to be made.'' The budget was put together on an `` exclusively partisan basis'' with the 90-member <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s 39 Democrats left on the sidelines, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s spending proposal calls for $ 86 million to $ 116 million more in overall spending than the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan, and puts different amounts of money into some areas. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s budget seeks about $ 40 million for employee pay raises, while the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> wants to spend $ 17.8 million, for example. And it proposes $ 22 million more in welfare agency spending than the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan represents an 11 percent increase over this year's spending Some Republicans criticized Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> for vetoing the full budget, instead of just the items she objected to, adding that she had not played a major role in budget talks apart from putting out an official proposal in January as part of her State of the State message. `` She reminds me of groundhog day,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbet </PERSON>. `` She came out and gave the State of the State, and saw her shadow and we have n't seen her since.'' No other governor in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s history has vetoed a full budget, according to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> clerk's office. `` I think of all of the options the governor had available to her, she selected the worst one,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>. `` If the governor was unhappy with either the revenue package or the budget, then what we needed was clear indication of what it is that she felt she could n't live with,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 Banking groups lined up Tuesday to oppose legislation that would require financial institutions to cash government checks for non-customers and offer low-cost savings or checking accounts. The bankers told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs that banks have been doing a good job of voluntarily meeting the needs of the poor and elderly and should not have new government requirements imposed on them as proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` How can it make sense for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to mandate one rigid approach which is supposed to meet the needs of all our diverse communities?'' asked <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. But officials of organizations representing consumers and the elderly told the panel that financial institutions ought to be ashamed to argue against government involvement at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering a $ 300 billion rescue of the savings and loan industry. `` Banking lobbyists have often stated that the banking industry is a private enterprise and should not be looked on as having to fill any given public purpose,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the Consumer Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Such an assumption made in the face of the astronomical costs to the public of the S & amp; L bailout is indefensible.'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> had originally tried to enact his proposals by attaching them to the S & amp; L bailout bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> April 19, but he backed off after Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the subcommittee, promised him a hearing <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he was keeping an open mind on the proposals and would decide `` in a month or so'' whether to begin moving them through the legislative process. One of <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bills would require banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to cash government checks, such as welfare and Social Security payments, of up to $ 1,500 for non-customers with proper identification. The institutions would be permitted to cover their costs through a low fee set by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The second measure would require financial institutions to offer low-cost accounts with a minimum balance of $ 25 and a maximum balance of $ 1,000. The institutions would have to provide monthly statements and permit up to 10 checks or withdrawals a month. `` This is not drastic or draconian legislation. It's a very modest proposal,'' he said. However, banking groups complained they would suffer losses from fraud if denied the right to refuse to cash a check. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> said a survey showed that more than half of all banks and three-quarters of large banks already offer low-cost basic accounts and 80 percent cash government checks for non-customers. As an alternative to mandated check-cashing, the bankers advocated expanding government programs to directly deposit checks into bank accounts. But consumer groups and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> said low-income people often ca n't afford bank accounts and are forced to rely on expensive check-cashing services. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> said many elderly people were suspicious of direct deposits, believing their money could be misdirected. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the industry's claim that more than half of all banks offer low-cost accounts is flawed because they too broadly define low-cost. She said only one in four banks offers checking accounts with a $ 3 or less monthly fee. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel is holding another hearing Wednesday on a third <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> proposal that would require banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to make public their record of serving poor and minority neighborhoods. Other banking groups opposing <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> are the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sat alone over a draft of his resignation speech, while nearby in the Capitol, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> hosted a breakfast meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration budget officers. All around him last week, ambitious Democrats were scrambling for support in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership races, but not <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. `` I was not going to campaign for an office for which there was no vacancy,'' he would say later. Tuesday, just after noon, the man from <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, filled the vacancy. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was out as Speaker of the House. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was in. Throughout the turmoil over <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s political demise, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> went out of his way to conduct business as usual. Budget meetings, funerals, a ride down Main Street _ he kept to a normal schedule during an extraordinary week. `` It was a very very wrenching time,'' he says now. `` I would have hoped if I had a chance to become speaker, it would have happened through the normal succession.'' His activities during this unusual succession may provide a hint of his leadership style in the House. Publicly, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> worked to keep the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moving on a legislative agenda that slipped badly over the past several months. Privately, he played a quiet, behind-the-scenes role in the tumultuous events. Some Democrats urged <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, 60 years old and a 25-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to distance himself from the wounded speaker. He refused, telling a reporter, `` I believe strongly in political loyalty.'' `` It has n't been that difficult to stick with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' he added. In fact, political observers would have been astonished to see <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> add to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s difficulties. Instead, he seemed to bolster the beleaguered speaker by working to keep the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in motion. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> kept one eye on the politics of succession, one eye on legislation. He invited budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and others over for breakfast. Over scrambled eggs and bacon served in the elegant majority leader's dining room, the session revolved around the nuts and bolts of a budget. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for former Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>'s funeral and then went on to his eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> district. With a growing entourage of reporters, he tended to local matters and took time for a ride in an old <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> convertible down the main street of <LOCATION> Oakesdale </LOCATION> _ about as far away from the Capitol as a politician can get in both distance, attitude and spirit. Even there, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was unable to escape from the political firestorm building in the other <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had been surprised two days before by the news that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, following a barrage of reports about his junk bond investments, was going to resign. Late in the day came a CBS report that said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the personnel practices of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., the man who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus in the House `` I want to believe and I hope there was no plan to attempt political intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'' in the <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> cases, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. In private back at the Capitol, trusted by both sides, he played a quiet role in ill-fated negotiations that would have brought <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s immediate resignation in exchange for dismissal of some charges by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. He had been <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s occasional confidant, as well. Twice during recent months, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> indicated he was thinking of stepping down at the end of his term and told <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> he should prepare to become speaker. Both times, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to avoid any precipitous decisions. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> met last Tuesday morning, ostensibly to discuss the week's legislative agenda, but the speaker broached the subject of resignation and again made clear he wanted to lay his case before the country and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and also wanted a permanent record in the annals of the House. Wednesday began with the budget summit, but within hours <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> he intended to make a speech on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor _ a signal he was going to resign. A flurry of meetings in <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s office followed, including one with Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the ethics committee <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> spent the next several hours on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor.

Afterward, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> quickly was on the phone asking colleagues for support, now that he could make an open bid for the speakership. There were no other contenders. But he said he had learned from former Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> not to take anything or anyone for granted. `` People like to be asked for their support one-on-one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Boston-Washington Corridor Is Home to One in Six Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The massive Boston-Washington urban corridor is home to one in six Americans, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Data from a new census study also show that the corridor contains almost one in four of the Americans who reside in metropolitan areas. The data, for 1987, showed 43.5 million people residing in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> corridor which includes 25 contiguous metropolitan statistical areas. With a national population of 243,396,000 people as of July 1, 1987, that means about 17 percent of the nation lived in the megalopolis. And the bureau reports that 187,072,000 Americans lived in metropolitan areas, nearly 23 percent of them in the <LOCATION> Boston-Washington </LOCATION> region. There are four major clusters within the <LOCATION> Boston-Washington </LOCATION> region: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 27.8 million; Boston-Providence, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, 6.2 million; <LOCATION> Washington-Baltimore </LOCATION>, 6.1 million and <LOCATION> Harrisburg-York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, 1 million.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators Tuesday to create a domestic world bank which would make loans for housing and small businesses and generate revenue for government services. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a former presidential candidate, spoke at a private meeting of about 20 Democrats on investment plan, which would make heavy use of pension funds but require no tax money. The bank would get its pool of capital from 10 percent of the $ 800 billion in public pension funds and money that private pension programs would be willing to invest, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters. The program would be administered by a board of labor, management and government representatives. He said the bank would make government-secured loans which could `` begin to build affordable housing, economically integrated housing, small and medium-sized businesses.'' The loans would `` generate revenue, which of course pays taxes for a health plan, and for police and fire services and for education,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the senators exhibited `` a great degree of optimism'', adding that Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., promised to conduct hearings on the idea The investment plan is needed, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, because the budget deficit prohibits substantial investment in rural and urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and `` banks and insurance companies, with redlining, would not invest in urban or rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` The Democratic Party ... is at a point to take the offensive, to take the lead,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Right now, the headlines are dominated by the leadership changes on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side and focused on personal ethics. There is no focus on the ethical challenge to rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 Faced with a chaotic situation, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is encouraging all Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to leave the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> capital and is arranging for added flights out of the country, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced today. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> described the climate as `` tense and unsettled'' but said there were no known threats against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> residents, tourists or diplomats. An estimated 1,400 Americans are in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and 8,800 in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> overall. `` Persons in other parts of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may also wish to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> depending on the local situation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` Citizens who chose to leave should, if possible, avoid routes out of the country that would require them to travel through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' The spokeswoman said arrangements were being made with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> airlines to supplement their regular service from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with charter flights. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport was reported open. For the first time, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged there may be dissension within the ranks of the Chinese armed forces. `` We have reason to believe that all elements of the Army do not support what is taking place,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We have no firm evidence of armed clashes.'' Troops opened fire on Sunday on students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, killing hundreds of the young demonstrators who were demanding democratic reforms in the world's largest Marxist country. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> also announced that all Chinese in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be allowed to remain indefinitely because of the situation at home. She said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the move as a compassionate gesture. Sources said telephone calls were being made systematically to all American residents of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, who had been asked earlier to make the embassy aware of their whereabouts. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday urged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to stay away from campuses and to remain in touch with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy. The department also renewed its advisory urging Americans against travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Chinese capital was threatened with civil war as armies loyal to rival political factions were reported battling for control of the city. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday the world `` must stand with'' the Chinese demonstrator who, in a singular act of defiance captured by television, placed himself in front of a column of tanks rolling through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` I think that image is going to be with us for a long time,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And all I can say to him, wherever he might be, and to the people around the world, is: we are, and we must, stand with him.'' Crafting a course influenced by his firsthand experience in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suspended more than $ 600 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but stopped short of advocating economic sanctions. `` I reserve the right to take a whole new look at things if the violence escalates,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, but for now he is sticking with the arms move and suspending visits between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military leaders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the announcement _ applauded by congressional leaders _ at a news conference, but later discussed the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> situation again emotionally during a speech before the Business Roundtable. The president met today with the leader of another <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> power, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, pledging to join Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in exploring `` any serious avenue'' to a political solution to the bloody conflict in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Prime Minister <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and I reviewed the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. ... We agreed ... that the job is not done,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the Afghan rebels' struggle to topple the Marxist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> remains fully committed to a politcal solution'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said following a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House. In his remarks Monday night to business leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was haunted by the sight _ played frequently through the day on television _ of a demonstrator who stood alone in front of tanks advancing through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` I was so moved by the bravery of that individual ... What is it that gives a young man strength, gives him the courage, to stand up in front of a column of tanks right there in front of the world?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the business leaders they should continue to seek trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, claiming he preferred military sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rather than economic ones. Earlier, he told reporters, `` I do n't want to hurt the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people.'' He rejected out of hand the idea of recalling the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. `` That would be 180 degrees wrong,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was himself the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1974-75. `` Our ambassador provides one of the best listening posts we have in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' `` I am trying to take steps that will encourage a peaceful change, and yet recognize the fact that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does have great pride in its own history,'' he said. Leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who visited the White House for a foreign policy review with the president, including a firsthand report on his triumphs at last week's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, emerged with strong praise for the course <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has set. `` I think he's done the right thing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., after the bipartisan session <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also made clear, both at his news conference and in an unusual Oval Office meeting, the depth of what he called the `` great admiration in my heart for the students'' who have demonstrated and now died for democracy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he would give `` sympathetic review'' to visa extensions for any of the 40,000 Chinese students studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who were afraid of returning home. The White House hastily invited four pro-democracy Chinese graduate students and activists from local universities to meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president looked on approvingly as <PERSON> Jia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hao </PERSON>, 38, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, applauded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions, saying they `` will be a great support spiritually and physically to the people who are fighting for the freedom and democracy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> condemned the assault as `` a violent and bloody attack'' on demonstrators who were `` advocating basic human rights.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said halting arms sales `` is going to send a strong signal. I'm not saying it's going to cure the short-range problem in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ... but I think it is very important the Chinese leaders know it's not going to be business as usual. White House officials said that over $ 600 million in continuing military sles to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would be affected _ including a $ 502 million program to help the Chinese upgrade electronic and navigational equipment on their F-8 fighter jets. Other projects affected are the final two units in a $ 62.5 million sale of four artillery-locating radars, a $ 28.5 million program for upgrading large-calibre ammunition production, and an $ 8.5 million sale of anti-submarine torpedos. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sold more than $ 700 million in arms to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1979.

 After the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> moves into what is arguably the Islamic revolution's most decisive phase as rival factions jockey for power Some analysts and Iranian opposition figures in exile predict that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be gripped by another bloody paroxysm as <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s heirs battle for supremacy However, most believe the transition could take many months of bitter, but largely peaceful, maneuvering. The swift action Sunday by the 83-member Assembly of Experts, formed in 1979 to ensure the smooth transition of power, in naming President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as caretaker ruler appears to have contained an open struggle for power for the time being But it has not eliminated it. The country's political future is more uncertain now than at any period since <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> was toppled in 1979 and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> returned in triumph from exile to found the theocratic Islamic republic. In its 10 turbulent years, the republic has endured the hostility of much of the world, bloody internal schisms, a grueling war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the humiliation of having to accept a cease-fire after a string of battlefield disasters. But surviving <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death and settling the succession issue will be the revolution's most strenuous test. Even as <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was being buried amid scenes of mass anguish, the men he installed in power were lining up against other. One one side are the so-called pragmatists led by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>. They favor a collective leadership, opening doors to the West and tackling the urgent task of postwar reconstruction. On the other are the anti-Western radicals under Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who believe the revolution's survival depends on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s preeminence in the Moslem world and who seek the spread of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s fundamentalism Opposition groups in exile, including monarchists led by the <PERSON> shah </PERSON>'s son and heavily armed rebels based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, have largely been sidelined and their rhetoric apart, few see them as contenders in the power struggle. Some analysts believe that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will move toward a less rigid religious-based system, downgrading the theocracy that has played such a dominant role since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was catapulted to power. <PERSON> Khamanei </PERSON>, a hojatoleslam, or middle-ranking cleric, clearly has not inherited <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s undisputed spiritual authority. Since his appointment, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media has accorded him the courtesy title of `` ayatollah.'' But it has not referred to him as `` imam,'' or spiritual leader, as <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was universally known throughout <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` No one can command Kohmeini's authority,'' said <PERSON> Shahram </PERSON> <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> analyst with <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a gap and it's got to be filled. There's movement toward a more secular system,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died before he could oversee the settlement of the leadership question. That will likely be resolved Aug. 18, when constitutional changes formulated by a 20-man committee <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> appointed in April will be put to the nation in a referendum held at the same time as presidential elections. The constitutional amendments, aimed at eliminating competing centers of power which <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> described as `` flaws and imperfections,'' will have a far-reaching impact. If, as seems likely, the committee invests the presidency with wider powers at the expense of the prime ministry, the door will be open for a more liberal system which favors the so-called pragmatists. The committee may also downgrade the religious credentials needed for leadership and propose a collective leadership of three to five figures in the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy. `` In the long run, I'd say the pragmatists will win,'' said London-based <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> specialist Badeq Mo'in, whose biography of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> will be published soon. `` But in the short term, even the pragmatists will have to pretend to be radical in order to survive,'' he said. `` Survival is the key question for the leadership in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today. Even if they come up with hardline rhetoric now, eventually they'll have to cope with the outside world and de-isolate themselves in order to survive. One of the central strands in the power struggle is the economy. The war and chronic mismanagement has left it in bad shape. The key question is whether those who eventually come out on top look inward, seeking to galvanize the revolutionary zeal that has clearly flagged, or outward, to end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s isolation that has smothered development. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> faces a social explosion in the years ahead. Its population, currently about 55 million, will have mushroomed to 100 million by the end of the century. Unless the country can rebuild and expand, drawing on foreign financial aid and technology, it faces economic and political turmoil on a fightening scale.

<HEAD>Report: Children's Mental Health Care Is Fragmented, Needlessly Expensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 States are increasingly relying on expensive residential facilities and state hospitals to treat emotionally disturbed children when lower-cost, community-based services would better serve their needs, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In its `` Invisible Children Report,'' the association also said states must improve coordination of their child mental health services, which are often spread among welfare, juvenile justice, education and health systems. `` The system for mental health care for children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in shambles _ and thus very expensive,'' said the report, estimating states spend more than $ 1 billion annually on state hospital and out-of-state residential care for children. `` Much of this investment could be used more appropriately to develop needed community-based programs,'' which often keep the child in the home, the report said. The association estimates that 12 percent to 15 percent of the 63 million children and adolescents in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> need mental health treatment for emotional or other problems. Based on its estimate that only one in three children in need of mental health care is getting it, the association recommended that states and the federal government triple the resources allocated to children's mental health services. Association officials said they had no estimate of the total amount now spent on these services. The report cited government and private studies finding that residential care is on the rise. One study found a 450 percent increase in placements of youth in private psychiatric facilities during the earlier part of the decade. About 70 percent of current child mental health funding is spent on residential facilties, the report said. `` Policymakers labor under the false assumption that intensive services are synonymous only with in-patient care,'' the report said. However, the report pointed to in-home crisis programs in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as examples of programs `` proven effective in treating the child, preserving the family unit and generating cost savings.'' The report found startling differences in comparing the costs of treatment in residential facilities and state hospitals with those in the home and in day treatment centers. The national average cost of keeping a child in a state hospital is $ 299 per day. With the average stay 4.2 months, that amounts to $ 38,218. Nationally, the average cost for a residential treatment facility is $ 111.67 per day and the average stay is 15.4 months, for a total cost of $ 52,300. In contrast, the report estimated the cost of six weeks of intensive in-home crisis counseling at $ 1,100, and the cost of a year in day treatment for a seriously emotionally disturbed child at $ 15,000 to $ 18,000.

 In a suburb nearly 8,000 miles from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, a band of Chinese students is working around the clock to relay news from the student rebellion to comrades throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Defying a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news blackout, the students are using telephones and facsimile machines to contact relatives, other students, hospitals, newspapers and even sympathetic government officials. Since soliders opened fire on civilians over the weekend, the students have been trying to confirm rumored troop movements and compile an accurate body count. `` We get very, very different information from different sources,'' <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student, said Tuesday. `` Many people in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, they figure out that it's at least 30,000 died. But here, they're reporting 2,600 died.'' <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Longxi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student, scanned a television set, looking for some of the young people he had once taught English. They had been widely quoted in the early, peaceful days of the demonstrations because of their English proficiency. He has n't seen them since, and wears a black armband, fearing they have died. One student telephoned his mother, a journalist in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, to relay the latest news of shooting in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He warned her that troops were rumored to be headed for <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, and that students should evacuate campuses to avoid bloodshed. His mother said phone communications between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> had been all but severed, said the student, who requested anonymity because he fears retaliation against his parents. He said he considered going home, but his parents told him, `` Do n't even think about that.'' The students have been operating out of the <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> since May 24, when the center's executive director, the Rev. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, offered them half of the rambling religious center and three free phone lines. `` Somehow, the word has spread in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that to get your message out, call here, because we're getting calls from people we do n't know,'' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said He also persuaded a local hotel to donate a fax machine. `` <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s revolution was revolution by cassette tape recorder, and this is revolution by fax,'' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. Though it has become increasingly difficult to telephone _ students believe the cable to <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has been severed _ and the phone bill is now more than $ 20,000, the students are n't giving up, said <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Xia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gong </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student and one of the information center's organizers `` First we need to get information from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` And we need to give encouragement to students there that they are not forgotten by the world.'' The students also want the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military to know that the rest of the worldis monitoring its actions. The Walker center in this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb has become a haven for Chinese students worried about their loved ones and frustrated by their isolation from the momentous events in their homeland. The students have been passing information gleaned from their sources to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. In some cases their information has been confirmed by Western media reports hours later, he said, but other reports have been impossible to substantiate. For example, three different sources calling from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, have reported seeing soliders with glassy eyes and slack jaws who appear to have been drugged, <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. Rumor in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has it that the soldiers were injected with some mood-altering drug, which they were told was an antibiotic, in order to make them more willing to deal harshly with the students, he said. Yuan <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said the students have been able to reach foreign embassies and banks, but are having trouble reaching private telephones in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` It's better if they call us but it's risky because you have to give the operator your name and all the phones are bugged,'' he said. He said one student had managed to get through from a pay phone to report on the shooting on one of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s thoroughfares, shortly after it began.

<HEAD>Michel's Introduction of Foley as New House Speaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a transcript of House Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>'s remarks Tuesday introducing <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as the new speaker of the House. Once again I hold in my hand, temporarily alas, the symbol of the authority of the speaker of the House. We are taught that it is better to give than to receive. I believe that. When it comes to the speaker's gavel, I have become distressingly expert at it, having now gone down to defeat for the sixth straight time on a party line vote. I look forward to the day when someone on the other side of the aisle learns the joy of such selfless behavior. My colleagues, I know you are anxious to hear from the speaker, but before presenting him formally to you I would ask your forbearance that I make a few comments of my own. During the recent past, we have taken part in a number of ceremonies commemorating the bicentennial of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. We had a marvelous celebration on this floor in which many of us got the opportunity to say what we believed about this great institution. But in a curious irony of history, some might say a tragedy of history, the very year in which we celebrated the great traditions and glories of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> it has been blighted by unprecedented crises, personal and institutional. Today, we have that rare, most precious, improbable of gifts, a second chance for comprehensive bipartisan institutional reform that will set the course for the next century. Let me turn to my friends on the other side of the aisle, for a moment. I hope you'll take this in the spirit in which it's intended First, no political party, no man or woman in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, no faction or ideology has a monopoly on virtue. Human folly is an equal opportunity employer. No, there is no monopoly on virtue. But for over 35 years there has been a monopoly of power in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 35 years of uninterrupted power can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity. Those who have been kings of the Hill for so long may forget that majority status is not a divine right and minority status is not a permanent condition. At the heart of our crises are not personal faults of individual members. After 32 years as a member and over 40 years on the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, it is my belief that the personal integrity of the overwhelming number of members of this institution is and has been as good or better than that of any group in our society, especially those who criticize the most. I believe that the processes established by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to deal with ethics cases have to proceed. The former speaker said in his farewell address to the House that this mindless cannibalism has got to stop. Now, it's a catchy phrase. But the distinguished members of the ethics committee, equally divided from both parties, are neither mindless nor cannibals. In fact, in fact, it is their reasoned judgment under extraordinary pressure that stands between us and the cannibalism which the speaker referred to. I'm all for putting an end to bitterness. I'm all in favor of putting our House in order. But we do n't do so by sweeping things under the rug. This House is in a convulsive state. We've experienced some really dark days. But I take heart in the strengths that are built into this institution to cope with the times. I also take heart that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, for whom I have the greatest admiration, will be the new speaker. Yes, we're going to have our marked differences, that's the nature of this place. But that need not intrude on the mutual respect and the trust that we have for one another as leaders. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> coming from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> reminds me of the line of poetry that says: `` But Westward look, the land is bright.'' Congratulations, Mr. Speaker-elect. Let me hand over to you the symbol of the great power and the great responsibility you have just been given by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Ladies and gentlemen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, what a privilege for me to present to you the new speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Leaking Oil Line Exempt From Federal Inspection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRAIG, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Amoco pipeline that spilled crude oil into the <LOCATION> Yampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> last week is among hundreds of miles of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> pipelines exempted from government safety inspections, officials say. The oil industry persuaded the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1985 to drop all federal maintenance inspections of that type of oil pipeline, known as a gathering line. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Pipeline Safety no longer conducts regular checks on the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> line, which leaked about 10,000 gallons of light crude Friday into the <LOCATION> Yampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. But an <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company meets federal standards on such lines. The spill was declared contained Sunday, and much of the oil that was not contained broke up or was washed away in the swiftly flowing river, officials said. But they said there still could be long-range effects on the environment. That part of the river is home to three endangered fish species. Traces of the spill were found as far away as 100 miles downriver from the site. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Overly </PERSON>, who oversees oil-pipeline inspections in 12 Western states from the transportation department's <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> regional office, said he did n't have figures on the number of miles of pipeline were exempted from regulation. But he estimated the total as 1,000 miles in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> alone. `` If this leak was caused by corrosion, we definitely could have had an effect on this pipeline'' if it still were subject to federal regulation and inspection, Overly said. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> executives said the company still does not know what caused the leak. But Overly, noting that the leak occurred where the pipeline passed beneath the river, said rust `` is the first thing I would suspect.'' The 6-inch line carried more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil a day. A gathering line generally links an oil field with storage tanks. The transportation department still inspects about 500 miles of oil pipelines in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, Overly said. Those pipelines are called transmission lines, and they generally link refineries with major distribution points. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigg </PERSON> confirmed that the 106-mile pipeline involved in the leak, linking an oil field near <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> with storage tanks in <LOCATION> Wamsutter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, is subject to no state or federal inspections. He said <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s policy on maintenance is to `` comply with ... federal regulation'' on all company pipelines, even though the regulations no longer apply to gathering lines. He said the line at <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> was inspected in 1985 and repaired in 1986. Overly said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials exempted gathering lines from federal regulation after oil executives said the pipes did n't pose serious threats to public health because most pass through remote terrain.

 A pipeline that provided 90 percent of the gasoline for the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> area before it exploded in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> could be back in operation by Friday, which could mean a drop in prices at the gas pump. Prices jumped as much as a nickel a gallon when the pipeline exploded May 25 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, killing two people and injuring 31. The blast knocked out the <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pipeline that carried gasoline and diesel fuel from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> refineries to the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.

No gasoline shortages or service station lines have been reported in the city. The price for self service unleaded gasoline has been running $ 1.10 to $ 1.12 a gallon since the pipeline explosion.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was buried Tuesday after a day of tumult in which frenzied mourners snatched the shroud from their revered leader's body and tore it to shreds for holy relics. Thousands of Revolutionary Guards and civilians jostled around the grave at the Baheshte Zahra cemetery, raising clouds of dust, as <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s body was finally laid to rest at 4:45 p.m.. A television announcer, his voice hoarse with emotion, chanted `` Father, do n't leave your children Oh father do n't leave your beloved!'' as the crowd surged toward the grave. People wept and beat their heads and chests with clenched fists in the Shiite Moslem expression of bereavement. Soldiers passed concrete slabs over the sea of mourners and laid them across the grave, a shallow pit in a 100-square-yard section of the vast cemetery where men who died in the Islamic revolution and the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are buried. A crane lowered a metal freight container onto the grave to prevent people from grabbing handfuls of dirt from it and possibly unearthing the body. Guns roared a last salute to the 86-year-old patriarch who toppled a 2,500-year-old monarchy in 1979 and transformed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into a militant Islamic state. For the moment, at least, no special marker was put on the grave. Earlier in the day, mourners blocked the path of a van carrying the body in an open coffin from the square where it had lain in state for 24 hours in an air-conditioned glass cubicle. Mourners scrambling for mementos grabbed the tightly wrapped white shroud in which Moslems are buried and tore it to shreds. The body fell to the ground and was taken to an ambulance. State television later showed mourners grabbing at the body and shroud, exposing the feet, then the broadcast was cut off abruptly. `` The people love the imam too much,'' said a young man at the scene. `` They can not bear to see him buried.'' He said they wanted pieces of the shroud `` as sacred relics.'' Iranians refer to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as the imam, or spiritual leader. The coffin was transferred to a military helicopter, but the crowd rushed forward as it tried to land. As the helicopter flew away with the coffin protruding from its open door, the crowd was told the burial had been postponed. Three hours later, however, a helicopter landed the rewrapped body in a metal casket. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the parliament speaker, and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> accompanied the body and oversaw the burial. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> was knocked down in the earlier melee around the coffin and lost his black turban. He looked pale and dazed as he was hoisted above the crowd and passed from hand to hand to an ambulance. Women clad in head-to-toe black chadors rubbed shoulders with men despite the Islamic prohibition of physical contact between a woman and any man other than her husband. Firemen sprayed the crowd with jets of water from fire hoses. Most of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s 6 million people appeared to be in the streets Tuesday, and official media said millions more came from other regions to bid <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> farewell. About 2 million mourners had kept a night-long vigil around the bier in <LOCATION> Mousalam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION>, 22 miles north of the cemetery. Eight people were killed Monday in the packed square, some suffocating and others trampled to death. About 500 mourners were injured or collapsed in temperatures of 104. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died of a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after intestinal surgery, without settling the question of who would succeed him. He left a 29-page `` political testament,'' extracts of which his son read over <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio Monday. It contained an attack on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called the `` Great Satan,'' and said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should guard against `` the conspiracies and plots of the enemies toward the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.'' `` In the forefront of these is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, this vile state terrorist, which has set fire to the whole world, and its ally global Zionism, which, to attain its goals, commits such crimes that pens are ashamed to document them and tongues are ashamed to recite them,'' he said. Nothing was said of how <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should be governed after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death, but that may be contained in sections not yet released President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, 49, was named caretaker leader on Sunday, winning 60 of 74 votes cast by the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experts </ORGANIZATION>, a group <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> formed soon after the revolution to handle the succession issue. His swift appointment appeared aimed at filling the political vacuum and averting an immediate power struggle between hard liners and those who favor restoring ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Greenpeace Reports Dozens of Nuclear Weapons, Reactors Lost on Ocean
Floor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 50 nuclear weapons and nine nuclear reactors, the products of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet naval accidents since World War II, are lost on the ocean floor, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. `` There are more likely more Soviet weapons and reactors on the bottom of the ocean,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, co-author of the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmental group, which favors nuclear-free seas, and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal research group. Using data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the groups found that more than 2,000 major peacetime naval accidents have occurred since 1945 resulting in some 2,800 deaths. The accidents ranged from the loss of an entire vessel and crew to minor collisions and fires that left little damage and some injuries. The researchers omitted incidents that occurred during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and Korean Wars and in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> during the Iran-Iraq war, <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said. Since World War II, 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet accidents and a decision by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to intentionally scuttle one reactor, have left 50 sunken warheads and nine reactors on the ocean floor. Forty-three of the 50 warheads and six of the nine reactors are Soviet. The report specifically details 1,276 accidents, including the Soviet Mike-class submarine that sank in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on April 7 with two nuclear tipped torpedoes and two nuclear reactors aboard. The most serious incident apparently was the sinking of a Soviet Yankee-class submarine with 32 nuclear warheads and two nuclear torpedoes aboard. The sinking occurred 600 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> on Oct. 6, 1986. But <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said the number of nuclear weapons on the ocean floor may be higher because `` we are ascribing only two nuclear torpedoes to each Soviet submarine. They could, of course, have more.'' <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said researchers received no information from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for their study and when `` we asked the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- intelligence community to provide us with their analysis of Soviet accidents, they declined to do so on the basis of security.'' The report found that of the accidents, 228 involved aircraft carriers, 406 other major surface warships, 182 supply ships, 142 minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels. Seventy-five incidents involved sinkings. Of these, 27 were submarines _ five of them Soviet, four American, four French and three British, as well as submarines from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` In accident after accident after accident, human failure is the responsible cause,'' <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said. In addition, about 30 percent of the 1,276 accidents occurred in ports, possibly endangering civilians nearby, said <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Handler </PERSON>, the report's other co-author and a researcher with <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. Of those accidents, 624 occurred in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, 318 in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, 110 in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and 34 in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> earlier revealed information about two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accidents that received wide publicity over the past month. In 1965, an A-4 warplane fell off the USS Ticonderoga near <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> with a hydrogen bomb aboard, and on Nov. 22, 1975, a fire aboard the USS Belknap came within 40 feet of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said he suspected that the sinking of a Soviet destroyer in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in 1974 involved nuclear weapons or reactors, but said that has never been verified. Holding up a Russian-language version of the study, he said a copy would be delivered to the Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Haggling in a Central Asian bazaar over the price of strawberries sparked a spasm of ethnic violence, arson attacks and rampages by ax-wielding mobs in which 50 people were killed, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief reported Tuesday. <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> told lawmakers in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that authorities had re-established `` full control'' in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> 1,500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> following more than a week of bloody clashes between Uzbeks and members of an ethnic Turkish minority, the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON>. But he indicated the situation was still explosive. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said 6,000 internal security troops had been sent to restore order in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a national center of grape and cotton growing. Some of the 12,000 <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> in the area were evacuated Sunday and Monday to a military garrison to be housed in barracks under guard, the <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION> leader said in nationally televised remarks. `` They are safe now,'' <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said. The violence between the two Moslem groups was the latest outbreak of Soviet ethnic unrest, and its roots could be traced to the brutal policies of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who uprooted the entire population of 300,000 <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> from their homeland in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in November 1944 and deported them to the east under pretext of evacuation as the Germans approached. The <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> began to demand in 1956 that they be allowed to return to <LOCATION> Meskhetia </LOCATION>, their homeland in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said they had been pressing their demands harder as the country's new parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, meets in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Col. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency the clashes between Uzbeks and the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> began May 23, when a fight provoked by `` extremists'' in the city of <LOCATION> Kuvasai </LOCATION> near the border of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kirghizia </LOCATION> caused the death of one man and injured 60 others. Last Saturday, <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said, `` about 200 hooligans armed with metal rods, sticks and bottles filled with gasoline staged pogroms and set fire to buildings in the town of <LOCATION> Tashlak </LOCATION>.'' He said `` dozens of cars and houses'' were burned. The violence was spawned by `` an insignificant, minor conflict'' at a market when a <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> rudely spoke to a woman selling fruit whose prices he thought were too high, then knocked over her plate of strawberries, <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said. `` Citizens there perceived this as an insult, and a fight started,'' <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> told the Soviet of <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION>, one of the houses of the bicameral Soviet legislature, during its inaugural session Tuesday. Tempers enflamed by the marketplace squabble cooled, but <PERSON> Meskhis </PERSON> later attacked a group of Uzbeks and killed one of them, <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said. Calm was restored, he said. But about a week later, he said, a large group of Uzbeks ranging in age from 15 to 22 and `` in high spirits as a result of alcohol or drugs'' unexpectedly set off to attack the homes where the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> live. `` The Uzbek youth, armed with sticks, chains and axes, beat up people they found on the way and set fire to some homes belonging to Meskhi Turks,'' <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said. Soviet television reported Monday night that the dispute in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> turned into `` vicious clashes between thousands of furious people.'' It said the violence began as an ethnic dispute, but was fueled by chronic local unemployment. <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> told lawmakers that according to information available Tuesday, about 50 people had been killed, including 35 or more <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, 10 Uzbeks, one ethnic <PERSON> Tadzhik </PERSON> and an ethnic Russian who had been among those who `` restored order.'' <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that 200 people suspected of organizing and taking part in the rioting had been detained. A curfew was imposed in the area, <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said. Komsolmolskaya Pravda, the daily organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said a total of 194 people had been hospitalized, and that policemen and party workers were among the casualities. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops and officers were also hurt. <PERSON> Almaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estekov </PERSON>, a Moslem activist in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said representatives of the unofficial grassroots movement <PERSON> Berlik </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'s capital, told him by telephone that 13 policemen had been killed. But calls from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> did not go through Tuesday, and the report could not be independently confirmed. The <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> were used as the principal labor force in constructing the irrigation system in the barren Golodnaya Steppe of north-central <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, which was turned into a flourishing agricultural district. The <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> are ethnically related to the Georgians but were under Turkish rule during the 16th and 17th centuries, converted to Islam and adopted many Turkish characteristics. At present some <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> consider themselves Turks, while others consider themselves Georgians.

 A military court on Tuesday acquitted an army major of charges that he took part in an attempt to overthrow the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in 1987. The five-man military tribunal said the prosecution failed to produce evidence that Maj. <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lactao </PERSON> disregarded lawful orders from a superior officer. <PERSON> Lactao </PERSON> led about 30 soldiers aboard a column of tanks and armored personnel carriers from the army training camp in <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ecija </LOCATION> province to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> at the height of the bloodiest of six coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The coup on Aug. 28, 1987, left at least 53 people dead and hundreds others wounded. Military troops loyal to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> blocked <PERSON> Lactao </PERSON>'s group before it entered <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lactao </PERSON> said he did not violate any orders when he led the convoy back to the training camp on his own. Last year, <PERSON> Lactao </PERSON> and his men were cleared by another court martial of charges of mutiny.

<HEAD>`Brown II' Desegregation Ruling Gives Topeka Options Besides Busing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HANNA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 An appeals court will let <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> officials decide how to correct violations of the 35-year-old landmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision to desegregate schools, and busing is not a likely option, lawyers said Tuesday. The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> panel in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> said that although <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> officials had not resisted integration mandated by the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> decision in 1954, segregation still existed. The court's 2-1 ruling, released Monday, requires <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> to remedy racial imbalances in its public schools. `` I doubt that we're talking about busing,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an attorney for a group of parents who brought the desegregation lawsuit. `` I doubt if we're talking about anything really radical. This school district is not one of the worst school districts. It was n't the worst we had seen, or the worst we had read about.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebelius </PERSON>, the school district's attorney, said speculation on what officials will have to do is premature. `` They did n't tell us what to do,'' he said. `` Something has to be be done. They do n't say what.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudlacek </PERSON>, the district's spokeswoman, added: `` There's too much that has to happen before we even start to discuss that I do n't think there are easy answers.'' The district could ask the appellate court for a rehearing before all 10 judges and, if it gets a similar decision there, it could appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surpeme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sebelius </PERSON> said he did n't know whether the board would seek a rehearing `` No one has suggested that we have anything less than an excellent program,'' <PERSON> Sebelius </PERSON> said. `` There's just a differing view as to whether its done all it could do.'' In 1954, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that segregated school systems were unconstitutional because separate facilities for blacks and whites provided inherently unequal educational opportunities. The ruling came in a lawsuit against the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> district, which had set aside four elementary schools for black children. In 1979, parents of 17 black schoolchildren sued the district again, contending it had not eliminated vestiges of segregation. The parents included <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, a student in 1954 whose unmarried name is on the landmark case. The reopened case, sometimes called <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, went to trial in October 1986. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> ruled in April 1987 that the school district did not bear liability for racial imbalances in some of its schools because the parents failed to prove it intentionally tried to keep schools segregated. The appeals court said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> applied too strict a standard and said the parents merely had to prove segregation existed, given the history of the district. The parents had pointed to seven elementary schools and one middle school that they said had a disproportionately high number of minority students. At the time of the trial, 26 percent of the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>'s schoolchildren were from minority groups, and 19 percent were black. There are about 14,000 students in the district. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Biles </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said he was not sure what the appellate court's decision will mean in practical terms. <PERSON> Biles </PERSON> said he thinks the court has narrowed the scope of the case to focus on the assignment of students to schools, school attendance boundaries and the assignment of faculty and staff. Although he was reluctant to discuss specific solutions, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> suggested that the district may consider tinkering with attendance boundaries or improving curriculum at some predominantly black schools.

 <PERSON> Donny </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmond </PERSON>, known for sugarcoated songs with sister <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, has charted a comeback designed to shed his squeaky-clean image. The resurrection of his career is off to a fast start with the Top 5 single `` Soldier of Love,'' and <PERSON> Osmond </PERSON> has shed his polyester shirts, favoring a leather jacket, blue jeans, T-shirt and biker belt buckle. A whisker-stubble has replaced the peach fuzz.

That's why I named this album ` <PERSON> Donny </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmond </PERSON>.' You ca n't get plainer than that,'' he said.

 Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer, begins his first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next Monday and will ask his Soviet counterparts to spell out their proposals to cut conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his arms-cut proposals, `` has talked about men and he has talked about weapons systems,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` There are a lot of questions in our mind about exactly what that means, and what dismantling means, and what they will do with those systems, and what systems they are talking about. Those questions have not all been answered,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who during his 11-day visit will go to five of the 15 Soviet republics. The Eastern and Western alliances have recently proposed very similar ideas for cutting conventional forces in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but have not yet concluded a deal. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said that he would ask the Soviets why they recently increased tank production, despite statements by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that defense spending would be cut by 14 percent and military production by 20 percent over coming years. During the trip <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> may sign an agreement on curbing dangerous military incidents, such as the shooting death of Maj. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> at the hands of Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on March 24, 1985. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said the proposed agreement would address naval incidents inside territorial waters, such as the bumping of two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels by Soviet ships off the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Feb. 12, 1988, and the use of laser range finders that might blind soldiers or sailors on the either side. The visit by <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who will be accompanied by the vice chiefs of the four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military services, follows a tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last July by Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, then the Soviet chief of staff. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> has since become an adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and been replaced as defense minister by Col. Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON>. The Americans, according to an itinerary handed out at the briefing, will visit an unidentified Soviet missile facility near <LOCATION> Khelmnitsky </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, see a ground exercise in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, and ride on a Soviet missile cruiser and watch a naval maneuver off <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>, the northern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> port on the <LOCATION> Barents </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, a submariner, has asked to see the inside of a submarine, a request that the Soviets have neither accepted nor rejected. `` My instincts tell me that they will be very forthcoming,'' he said. He will also deliver an address at the Voroshilov military academy, and visit numerous graveyards, laying a total of seven wreaths. `` I do n't know who is behind the wreaths,'' he joked at the briefing. The visit also includes time for extensive discussions with Soviet military leaders. `` Certainly my purpose is not to negotiate. But I discovered last year when <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> _ and he and I had many hours together talking _ that it was very fruitful, at least from my perspective,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. `` We clarified things. We attempted to brush away some of the misunderstandings. There are a lot of questions that military people always carry around in their minds. Often we develop on our own the wrong answers. This gives me an opportunity to address my counterparts directly,'' he said. `` When Marshal <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> departed last year, I felt much better about what I knew and what they were saying and so forth,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>. The admiral said that <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> intelligence on Soviet military capabilities `` has been good, but obviously in certain areas we have done better than in others. `` We have been surprised on occasion. We have not done as well as we would prefer. Marshal <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> and I actually talked about that. I think there is a built-in tendency to overestimate the strength of ... opponents,'' he said. `` Marshal <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> and I on occasion pointed out to each other that he did n't understand our forces ... I told him that he overestimated my capability and he told me that I greatly overestimated his. He was talking about ground and I was talking about <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, a naval officer. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> is an army officer. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> also predicted that the two sides would discuss the military crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and developments in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` We will both have some curiosity about the other's feelings about what is going on in that part of the world.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday told visiting Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is willing `` to explore any serious avenue'' to achieve a political solution in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in turn said after private talks with the president that `` we are in complete accord'' on the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, stalemated since the pullout of the last Soviet troops in February. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> proved the effectiveness of <LOCATION> U.S-Pakistani </LOCATION> support for the Afghan resistance fighting the Marxist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> shares a common border with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We agreed, however, that the job is not done,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahdeen </ORGANIZATION> continues and their struggle for self-determination goes on.'' `` Prime Minister <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and I discussed ways to encourage a political solution in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that will lead to a non-aligned, representative government willing to live in peace with its neighbors, to replace the illegitimate regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will continue to explore any serious avenue towards this end.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had anticipated a rapid demise for the government of <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> after the Soviet pullout, but it has not happened. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` have reviewed the situation in the light of the prevailing circumstances and we are in complete accord'' on what needs to be done. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> remains committed to a political solution of the Afghan problem, whereby the brave people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will have the right to freely choose their own government without interference from outside,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, the daughter of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, said that while the Soviet pullout `` has brought a welcome change in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the continued fighting and prolonged presence of over 3.5 million Afghan refugees pose serious threats to the peace and stability of the region.'' After a full-dress military ceremony on the White House lawn, including a 19-gun salute, and an Oval Office meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and a lunch in her honor. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has a standing request to buy 60 more F-16 fighter jets from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside reporters' attempts to ask about reports that approval of the jet sale is imminent. On another topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> `` assured me that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s nuclear program is committed to peaceful purposes.'' He said he underlined his commitment `` to discourage proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> region and around the world.'' The two leaders also discussed efforts to combat drug production and trafficking. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he `` applauded her tough stance on eradicating the opium cultivation'' and thanked her for extraditing an alleged drug trafficker. The two countries were expected to sign agreements on housing, narcotics and education this week during <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s stay. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the third largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, is slated for $ 380 million in economic assistance and $ 240 million in military aid next year. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father was deposed by Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> in 1977 and hanged two years later for a political murder. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> remained in power until perishing in a mysterious plane crash last year that also claimed the life of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and an American general. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who had picked up her father's fallen standard and been jailed for a time under <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, led her <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to victory as head of a coalition government last November.

<TEXT>
 The race is on for the seat left vacant by the death of Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, with early expectations that the Aug. 29 special election called Tuesday could produce the first Cuban exile in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> announced the election schedule one day after burial of the 88-year-old congressman following a week of ceremonies and mourning. `` <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> will be difficult, if not impossible, to replace in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But it's vitally important that we move as quickly as possible so that the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 18th congressional district can be represented,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. Some leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, riding a wave of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> momentum in the state, were focusing upon state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> as their leading candidate for the seat that had been held by Pepper, a liberal Democrat, since its inception. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a Cuban-born millionaire banana importer and active supporter of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, also said he will run as a Republican. Democrats, with a longer list of interested candidates, had no one publicly committed. `` The Democrats should probably rally behind one candidate,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a Cuban-American among the potential Democratic contenders. `` But it's too early.'' A first primary was set for Aug. 1 and any runoff would be Aug. 15. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said elections would be held on the same day to replace state officeholders who seek the congressional seat. Under state law, they have to resign before they run. Candidates must file their nominating petitions with the state Division of Elections on June 19 or 20. Pepper, known nationwide for his efforts on behalf on the elderly, won every election for the district since the first in 1962, with his closest race in the past decade a 61-39 percent victory in 1984 over Cuban-American <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> Last year, he had no opposition at all. But Republicans have gained strength in the district, as <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> registration has sagged from 72 percent a decade ago to 54 percent now. Hispanics, estimated by some politicians to comprise nearly half the district, are considered likely to support a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> candidate. It's estimated that three-quarters of Cuban-American voters in the region are Republican. `` I think the chances are pretty good for a Cuban-American to be elected from that district,'' said <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON>, a Democratic strategist. `` Without a doubt, that person would be the most powerful Cuban-American in the country.'' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, elected in 1985 as the city's first Cuban-born mayor, ruled himself out of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> race Tuesday. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, an independent, did n't formally endorse anyone but praised <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>. She meanwhile said she would hold a news conference Wednesday to discuss her future. Republican state Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON>, a Cuban-born Jew whose heritage fits two large ethnic groups in the district, was also mulling his possibilities Tuesday. On the Democratic side, state Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said he will decide by Friday whether to run. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 67, shares much of Pepper's constituency and liberalism, but may have problems with Hispanic voters because of his opposition to Nicaraguan Contra aid and other foreign policy issues. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, Cuban-born mayor of <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>, has long said he'd like to run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> would wait to hear <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s decision Other potential Democratic candidates include Commissioner <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gersten </PERSON>, State Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and former school board chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cejas </PERSON>. Cejas and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> are Cuban-born. In the 1988 elections, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his largest margin in any state and Republicans gained a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, two House seats and two state Cabinet jobs. Republicans then claimed a 10-9 majority in the congressional delegation when Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> switched parties after the election.

<HEAD>Studies Show AIDS Decoy Drug May Reduce Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decoy drug designed to hopelessly confuse the AIDS virus by mimicking its natural target is safe and may lower levels of the lethal virus inside the body, researchers said Tuesday. Scientists said they were encouraged by the results, but they cautioned that testing is at an early stage, and no one can be sure how effective the medicine will be in stopping AIDS. `` Nevertheless, this represents an exciting step forward,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The drug is known as soluble CD4, and it is one of more than a dozen currently being used experimentally against the AIDS virus. So far, only one medicine, AZT, has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for use against HIV, the AIDS virus. While it can prolong the lives of people with AIDS, it does not cure the disease, and it has a variety of toxic side effects. `` It's clear that we desperately need alternative treatments to AZT,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Merigan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Reports on CD4 and other potential AIDS drugs were presented at the 5th International Conference on AIDS, the major annual meeting to review progress against the epidemic. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary for health, said progress in drug development `` is another success in our war against this terrible infection.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> also it is increasingly important to set up voluntary programs to contact sexual partners of HIV-infected people so they will know of their risk of catching the virus. CD4 is one of a growing group of medicines that are specifically designed to exploit the built-in weaknesses of the AIDS virus. In this case, the medicine is a synthetic copy of a molecule called CD4. These molecules cover the surface of a particular variety of blood cells known as helper T cells. These cells orchestrate the body's immune system, and they are the chief targets of HIV. The virus finds them by zeroing in on CD4. Researchers reason that by flooding the bloodstream with copies of CD4, the virus will mistakenly attack these decoys and miss the blood cells. In preliminary studies on 18 people at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, doctors found that short-term treatment with CD4 appeared to reduce the amount of virus in their bodies by about 50 percent. However, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarchoan </PERSON>, who directed the study, cautioned that such fluctuations can occur naturally and might not have resulted from the drug. None of the patients got better during the 19-day experiment. `` The results could have been better, but they could have been a lot worse,'' <PERSON> Yarchoan </PERSON> said. `` I still have a lot of enthusiasm for this approach. It has one of the best chances of therapeutic effect with the least toxicity of anything being discussed right now.'' A second preliminary study, conducted on 30 patients at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaconess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, found no clear evidence of viral reduction. The two studies were intended primarily to determine how large a dose of the medicine can be safely given. Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>, who led the study at the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hospital, said, `` I am very encouraged that the drug appears to be safe. The study was not designed to detect subtle degrees of efficacy. We may have not reached the effective dose yet.'' Researchers hope to make CD4 last longer in the bloodstream by chemically welding it to part of an antibody. They also have developed another hybrid that joins CD4 with a poison, a combination that might kill infected cells that make virus inside the body. <PERSON> Merigan </PERSON> said that 17 experimental AIDS drugs are being given to 7,000 patients in studies sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, and tests of six more will start soon.

<HEAD>Alameda County Enacts Emergency Assault Weapon Sales Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An ordinance immediately banning the sale of military-style assault weapons in unincorporated areas of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was passed Tuesday by the county Board of Supervisors. The 5-1 vote followed action by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> and the Legislature restricting the sale of more than 50 kinds of semiautomatic assault weapons throughout <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Supervisor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Perata </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ordinance closes a loophole in the state measure, which allows people to buy semiautomatic weapons until January and to apply for permits to keep them after January. The state law created a `` window of opportunity'' to buy the weapons, <PERSON> Perata </PERSON> said. `` This ordinance intends to ban such sales immediately in the county to prevent those who would evade the law from stockpiling an arsenal while these weapons are still legally available,'' he said. He said he was concerned about weapon stockpiling by drug dealers and others who have `` ravaged our communities.''

 Iranian opposition leaders predict they will return from exile with the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, but some analysts believe history has passed them by. Former government officials and the son of the late, deposed shah are granting interviews and issuing statements. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> rebel army, based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, says its fighters are on alert and awaiting the `` opportune moment to enter into action.'' Former President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said he `` certainly'' would leave his exile home outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to return to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but did not say when. <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death opens a `` door to our success. The Shiite Moslem patriarch's fundamentalist revolution overthrew the monarchy a decade ago. Adm. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Madani </PERSON>, a former defense minister considered the dark horse among the exiles, sees six months as a probable time for his return. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON>, professor of international relations at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, dismissed all the predictions and plans. `` None of them counts for anything,'' he said. `` They're all has-beens of one kind or another. They all exaggerate their importance. There are plenty of candidates inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and they do n't have to look for retreads.'' Not every student of Iranian affairs makes such a blunt assessment, but the consensus is that power struggles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must run their course before outsiders will have a chance to enter the fray. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died Saturday, 11 days after undergoing surgery for internal bleeding. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, a junior cleric, was chosen as caretaker leader. Opposition figures say, with rare unanimity, that the choice of <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> reveals a vacuum in the Iranian leadership, the lack of a replacement with the charisma of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. They predict initial chaos, leading to a more moderate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` With <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death, the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> died as well,'' <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, 27, said in a telephone interview. `` His passing away leaves a much more direct door to our success.'' <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON>, who follows Iranian events closely, said he believes <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> is the only opposition figure with a potential role to play and that only a crisis will present the opportunity. `` He is a symbol of an alternative and by definition not associated with the revolution or the current regime,'' <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON> said. `` What he represents is a nostalgia for the past, plus certain changes because he would n't go back to the old regime. `` He is the only one who would command significant respect in contemporary <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The rest are just talking in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> cafes.'' Since the Iranian revolution put <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in power in February 1979, politically active exiles and their leaders have clustered in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, banished by the shah, directed his revolution from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In 1980, after his father died of cancer, <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> took the crown and became shah-in-exile. He says now, however, that restoring the monarchy is not his goal. `` I positively believe that the monarchy is the most viable alternative for the country, but my mission is not the restoration of the monarchy,'' he said. His effort to unite the fractious opposition shows no signs of bearing fruit, and many dismiss young <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> as the least plausible leader among the exiles. `` The regime of royalty was buried forever in the cemetery of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s history,'' said <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouhani </PERSON>, spiritual leader of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Shiite community. <PERSON> Safa </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeri </PERSON>, an Iranian journalist specializing in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs, suggests <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> could return home `` in four or five years, if the moderates really consolidate power.'' He suggested <PERSON> Madani </PERSON>, the former defense minister, as possibly in the best position to profit from the changes in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Like some of the others, <PERSON> Madani </PERSON> maintains contacts within the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> leadership. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to topple the regime in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but they are heavily supported by neighboring <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Iraqis are unlikely to endorse any immediate effort to invade <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, despite differences on a permanent peace, are anxious to keep alive their current cease-fire truce in their 8-year-old war.

 A former sewer worker dubbed the `` ski mask rapist'' was sentenced Tuesday to 406 years in prison for his 117 felony-count convictions in the sexual assaults of 26 women. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 27, usually wore a ski mask when he stalked his victims in several <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> cities, police said. He often tied up his victims, threatened them with a knife or pellet gun, then sexually assaulted and robbed them. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>'s victims ranged in age from 16 to an 84-year-old woman attacked in a church confessional during Thanksgiving. His string of assaults from 1985 to 1987 led police and women's groups to offer public self-defense programs Authorities said the attacker often entered buildings through unlocked doors or windows, often spoke little and rarely let his victims see his face. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was convicted earlier this year of 22 counts each of rape, burglary and robbery and of 23 oral copulation charges, six assaults with intent to commit rape, 17 sexual batteries, four counts of sodomy and one count of penetration with a foreign object.

<TEXT>
 A year after flames swept through <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of the northern <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, wildfire experts warn that things could get just as hot this summer in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. `` We're dry, and it does n't look real hopeful for getting into a wet pattern,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, staff meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Drought conditions have eased, if not ended, in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and the rest of the northern tier of states in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. But they continue unabated in the southern <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and central and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Tuesday at a briefing on the region's fire season outlook. The <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> facility is the federal government's logistics and support nerve center for firefighting activities across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said the 27,587 wildfires reported nationwide through Monday were almost 18,000 fewer than the same date last year. But this year's fires are bigger. The 831,988 acres burned through Monday was almost 300,000 acres more than in 1988. Most of the 1989 fires so far have been in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have received only about 60 percent of normal precipitation since the current water year began last October. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has received 100 percent statewide, but most of that moisture has been in the north, leaving <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dangerously dry. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> has received 102 percent of normal precipitation, thanks to a fairly heavy winter snowpack and abnormally wet March, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. But even here, the soil is so dry after two years of drought that it will take an additional 5 to 10 inches of precipitation, particularly in southeastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and the central mountains, before the drought can really be declared over. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and most of the rest of the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> are expected to get near normal precipitation through August, `` which is n't much,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said The outlook is bleaker in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, where the only hope for improvement is the chance that monsoons will make their way north from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> later in the summer. `` If we do n't get that, it's going to be a long year,'' he said. Nationally, the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> fire center's <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said logistics support is in place for the season, no matter how bad it gets. `` We always prepare for every fire season as if it's going to be the worst in history,'' he said. `` For the past four or five years, it's been doing its best to prove us right.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Moves To Ensure Fair Health Coverage For Lower-Paid Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on Tuesday introduced a bill aimed at ensuring that lower-paid workers get a fair share of employer-paid health insurance coverage. The bill was signed by 32 other senators, including 15 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It would substitute for a much criticized provision of the 1986 tax overhaul known as Section 89. `` Section 89 has a desirable goal _ that rank-and-file employees should have tax-favored health and life benefits comparable to those provided to other, well-paid employees _ but the road map for getting there is too complicated for most American businesses to understand,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` It is n't working and even the so-called experts ca n't understand the details.'' The law requires employers to demonstrate, through complex and often expensive tests, that their health insurance plans do not discriminate in favor of higher-paid employees. That generally means employees earning more than about $ 50,000 a year. Employers have complained loudly about the rules. In some cases, critics say, employers have decided it would be simpler and less expensive to drop all health coverage for all workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has delayed enforcement of the rules until Oct. 1. There is strong pressure in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal the rules altogether. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> spent a good part of its session Tuesday debating repeal. However, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, are calling for major changes, rather than repeal <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s bill would delay the rules until January. It would view as non-discriminatory any plan that offered health insurance to 90 percent of all employees with the employer paying at least 60 percent of the premium. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> earlier introduced a bill that, in essence, would accept any health plan that was available to 90 percent of rank-and-file workers for an employee premium not exceeding $ 10 a week for a single person or $ 20 for family coverage.

 <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> got a silver platter Tuesday in honor of her athletic achievements. But her teammates wo n't hound her about stealing the spotlight. Ms. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> said love and praise will be ample awards for the dogs who helped her win the Iditarod Trail race three times in a row. `` I love my dogs. I love living in the wilderness. I'm a lucky person to have something I enjoy doing,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, who came from rural <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to claim the 22nd annual Tanqueray Amateur Athlete Achievement Award at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> luncheon. `` I'd never want to live here, but it's interesting and usually fun,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, who visits the city several times a year. Her 1987 record of 11 days, 2 hours, 5 minutes and 13 seconds still stands for the 1,200 mile dogsled race from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. She also won in 1986 and 1988, but came in second this year when several dogs became ill. `` These are athletes, like any other athletes,'' <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> said The 150 sled dogs she and her husband own have speed, endurance `` and the same thing I happen to have: drive and the competitive spirit.'' But she added that it's `` really a toss-up to say who's more important'' _ the dogs or the trainer. `` Another person could take my team and come in last.'' Ms. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, 33, a veterinary technician, began mushing dogs at age 16 in her native <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. She and her husband, fellow musher <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Monson </PERSON>, now live 70 miles from <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the nearest town. Besides giving Butcher the platter, the sponsor contributed $ 5,000 in Butcher's name to the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which trains people and pets to visit nursing homes and hospitals. Fortuna, an 8-year-old Alaskan husky who once was one of Butcher's dogs but retired after the 1987 Iditarod, was at the ceremony. The 42-pound dog was adopted in October 1987 by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Measday </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` For two weeks, she was silent. I think she was in mourning,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Measday </PERSON>. But later, `` she seemed real happy to get all the attention. She's not one of 150 dogs any more.'' Fortuna now runs with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.

 Workers kept pumping gas into a leaking pipeline for nearly an hour after it already had blown to pieces, spawning a fireball that engulfed two trains and turned scores of people into ash, state-run media said Tuesday. Soviet news reports said at least 190 people died in the pipeline blast early Sunday morning on the Trans-Siberian Railroad, about 750 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Some of the 762 people who were hospitalized with injuries from the blast are expected to die, according to television news program `` Vremya.'' It said said half of the injured had burns over more than 70 percent of their bodies. More than 200 people still were missing, and some officials said the final death toll could reach 500. Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> told the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> that the third and fourth days are the most critical for burn victims, and that Soviet doctors lack experience in treating such severe burns. `` This lack of experience obviously is complicating our work,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said doctors had determined 170 injured children needed special equipment to help them breathe, and that they were appealing for advice and urgent airlifts of equipment from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. A spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said 10 kidney dialysis machines were being sent from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The blast occurred when a pipeline carrying a highly flammable mixture of benzene, propane and butane sprang a leak, filling a forested valley with concentrations of gas. The gas was ignited by a spark from one of the two trains on the Trans-Siberian line nearby. The trains were traveling in opposite directions and had made unscheduled stops in the valley in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other officials have charged that workers in charge of the pipeline noticed a drop in pressure before the blast, but increased pressure instead of shutting the line down. `` Vremya'' said Tuesday night that the workers continued to pump gas through the pipeline for 55 minutes after the blast. An exasperated <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, briefing parliamentarians Monday after he returned from the scene, cited `` incompetence, irresponsibility, mismanagement, disgrace'' in the work of the pipeline. <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, also speaking to <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, said the secret police had sent a team of investigators to the area near <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION> to establish the truth. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> was carrying out a `` careful investigation of the reasons and circumstances of this extraordinary event. We understand the great difficultly of this work.'' The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> `` will do all that's possible to establish the truth and publicize the results of our work,'' he said. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> was working with prosecutors and the Interior and Health ministries. The blast was heard 16 miles away, and the Soviet military chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON>, told the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency Monday that it had the power of 10,000 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, or half the power of the first atomic bomb that was dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Many of the victims, including children on the way to summer camp, were burned beyond recognition, said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda. `` Identification of some of them is extremely difficult and in some cases, nothing is left but ashes,'' Pravda said. The blast stripped the 2.5 miles of trees and turned rail passenger cars into twisted hulks of charred metal. Dozens of airplanes and helicopters ferried the injured from the site of the blast to hospitals in the nearby cities of <LOCATION> Chelyabinsk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said 65 of the most severely burned, including eight children, had been brought to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for treatment.

He declared simply, `` I feel fine.'' Forced out of his leadership job over ethics questions, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> plans to resign his congressional seat later this month. In a week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, he would be `` enjoying life, I hope and trust, rejoicing in the good portion that has followed me and the opportunities that have been given me in life.'' As giant orange trash cans waited to be filled with cardboard boxes stuffed full of folders, frames and plaques in his staff's adjacent office, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked if he had any parting words `` I might express my appreciation to all of you for keeping a robust discussion going,'' he told a room packed full of reporters. `` I might want to write a column or two. Someone suggested I should become a columnist. It might be a good thing. In fact, I might discover who these unnamed sources are.'' Just 45 minutes before he was to nominate <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> before <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> closeted himself in his office with notes written the night before and wrote his last speech as speaker. A spokesman said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had not yet decided whether he would move to his congressional district office in the <ORGANIZATION> Longworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building until he resigns his seat. But it was clear that he and his staff were being pushed quickly out of the speaker's ceremonial office, although <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also has a personal office in the Capitol A floor below, outside the dining room where <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats have met for lunch on Wednesdays with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as their leader, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said he sensed an `` aura of hopefulness mixed with sadness'' pervading the Capitol. `` For the first time in three months I feel upbeat because the ascension of <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> promises a great deal in the area of rebuilding the institution -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which is at its lowest level,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. At the same time, he said he felt sadness for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who had campaigned for him and looked after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s interests in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I've talked to the speaker and he's at peace with himself and that made me feel better,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` He looks serene, he looks comfortable ... In the last month he had looked crestfallen.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned after a year-long investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee that cost more than $ 1.5 million and led to allegations that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules 69 times. The allegations surrounded sales of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' his wife's employment by a family friend, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, and his relationship with <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. While Texans mourned the loss of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> speaker and the clout and influence he gave their delegation, many predicted the scrappy former boxer from <LOCATION> Weatherford </LOCATION> would not disappear from the national scene. `` He'll not whimper away and crawl into some hole somewhere,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a `` strong-willed man with strong ideas,'' would probably want to continue to play a part in national affairs _ writing, speaking or teaching. `` He is healthy and well and feeling good and he's going to be able to contribute to political debate and thought for many years,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` He's got too much talent to go off and spend time in a boat and fish.''

 Solidarity says it does not want to govern despite its overwhelming public mandate in Sunday's parliamentary elections. But if the independent union wo n't, who will? That's the question facing both the opposition and government authorities following Solidarity's big victory over the communist party in the first largely democratic elections in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc in more than four decades. The communist <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is making no secret of the fact that it wants some sort of coalition or alliance with the Solidarity-led opposition. As deputy government spokesman <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON> said Tuesday, `` We need one another.'' But Solidarity was born and thrived as an opposition movement and has no appetite for assuming power in any way but through completely unfettered elections in four years. Solidarity-endorsed candidates accumulated majorities of 70-80 percent Sunday in practically every race they entered. Out of 261 candidates for the two-chamber national legislature, it seems that only eight failed to get the 50 percent of the vote needed to avoid a runoff election on June 18. In a normal parliamentary democracy, Solidarity next would peacefully assume the reins of power. But the Polish elections were governed by the inescapable reality that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> remains a communist state. And so, before agreeing to the elections, authorities were able to insist on reserving 65 percent of the parliament seats only for communists and their allies. As it turned out, the communists were having trouble filling even these `` guaranteed'' seats. Some of the party's best-known leaders, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and eight Politburo members, appear to have been rejected by more than half the voters even though they ran unopposed for parliament on a `` national list'' of 35 candidates. In a magnanimous gesture, the Solidarity leadership affirmed Tuesday that it will live up to the 65 percent-35 percent division of the parliament's lower house, the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, that was provided for under the April 3 accord between the union and government on sweeping social reforms. But while that saves the party from having to stage a messy court or parliament fight for its seats, it does not allay the humiliation of the party's loss and the resulting undermining of its standing at home and abroad. Everyone now understands that in fully free elections, the party would not stand the slightest chance of winning office. Anticipating the loss of the `` national list'' in an informal talk with reporters last week, senior Politburo member <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON> was blunt about the possibilities. Defeat of the list `` would be the biggest political joke ever committed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' he said, with Polish reform communists who agreed to the elections being perceived as having committed political suicide. `` They would be laughing like mad in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' two hardline communist capitals, he added. With its lack of support evident, the party is looking to bolster itself by drawing Solidarity into a `` grand coalition.'' Solidarity insists it wants to remain in opposition, but the political weakness of the party makes that seem more and more difficult. Because of its numbers in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and its mass popular support, the independent union will have a huge say in policy and appointments. For instance, no legislation will be able to get through the new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> without Solidarity votes. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has a veto over all bills, and the party lacks enough votes in the Sjm to override the veto. There is also the question of naming a new president and forming a new government after the new <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are seated. Theoretically, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> could keep his post despite having been denied a parliament seat. But it might be difficult for him to function effectively as prime minister after such a loss of face, and there likely will be calls for someone more popular with the voters to head the government. Similarly, the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are to meet together to name a president, a newly created executive office with strong powers under <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s revamped constitution that was designed to be a bulwark to keep <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the Soviet bloc. The presidential election was supposed to be a walkaway for Polish party leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> because of the party's built-in majority in the Sejm But if the `` national list'' seats are still vacant when the vote is taken, the party will have only a small three-vote edge. There have been popular calls for Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to offer himself as the opposition's candidate. Such calls are only likely to increase given the Solidarity election performance. President <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>? Such strange things are starting to look possible now that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has started down the road of democracy.

 A 14-year-old girl was raped and strangled in her grandparents' home, where she had moved to get away from the crime and drug abuse in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, her teacher said. `` That's what makes this so sad,'' said <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, principal of the school <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had attended. `` She came here to get away from violence and the things that wrap young people up in the city,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. `` She said many times she wanted to get away from that.''

 Soldiers and civilians battled mudslides and flood waters Tuesday to reach people left stranded after a storms that killed at least 275 people. Twenty-five people also were reported missing following the mudslides that buried their villages. At least 100,000 people were left homeless and an equal number were temporarily displaced by the flooding, relief officials said. The heavy rains eased Tuesday, but flood waters surging down the hills forced at least 5,000 people from their homes near <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the coastal capital city. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> boats and air force helicopters ferried food and medicine to areas cut off by flood waters Tuesday and the army tried to dig through mounds of earth blocking roads to the worst-hit areas. More than 100 people died in a mudslide that covered <PERSON> Bulathkopitiya </PERSON>, a village of mud-and-thatch huts 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, Col. N.K.A. <PERSON> Angammana </PERSON> said. He said soldiers were using bulldozers to open the road to <LOCATION> Bulathkopitya </LOCATION>, which is located in a valley of coconut and rubber plantations. A total of 240 bodies were recovered in the <LOCATION> Kegalle </LOCATION> district, which includes Bulathkopitya, <PERSON> Angammana </PERSON> said. Relief officials said the total death toll was 275.

<TEXT>
 The accomplishments of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will remain forever a monument to your leadership. And to the great leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, who left this place to assume the presidency as a healing president in a difficult time in our history, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>. And all of my colleagues, past and present, whose vision of the country, though sometimes sharply different, was marked by a common commitment to public service, shared concern for improving the common good, and a love of this House. We are proud to call this the people's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the fundamental institution of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracy. Although it is not the oldest parliament in the world, it has existed longer as an independent, popularly elected legislature than any other parliamentary body in history. As we watch the remarkable struggle of people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and the growing aspirations of the people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere to take control of their destiny, we should take great pride that the values that gave this institution its birth and which have flourished here and sustained us for two centuries now sweep around the world. This body reflects most closely the nation at large. It is not, as many have suggested, a fixed, stagnant body. It is constantly refreshed by new members from every corner of the country who have brought their ideas and energy to bear on behalf of the people they represent. Only 7 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s current members were in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when I was first elected in 1964. Eighty-one percent of the current members have been elected since 1974. More than half of the current members _ 55 percent _ have been elected since 1980. The constant change in membership is a source of great strength for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but fundamentally, and more importantly, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reflects the will of the electorate. Our business here is the people's business. It is time to put divisiveness behind us, to reach out and address the issues of national policy that members of both parties are eager to consider.

<HEAD>WASHN: to consider.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We must resolve to build support for schools that nourish the love of learning and are free from drugs and violence. We must deal with the problem of homelessness. We must strive to put the country at the cutting edge of economic innovation and the global economy. We must provide for the security of families, from child care to health care. In a time of changing and uncertain circumstances, we must assure our continued national security. We must solve our fiscal problems and protect the national and global environment. On these and other important public issues, we must act responsibly and resolutely. We will not reach any of these goals without a deep respect for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as an institution and a reaffirmation of the value of public service. I have been a member of the House for 25 years. I take great pride, as we all do, in my profession. Election to public office is a free gift of a free people. The challenge for all of us in public life is to use that gift to improve the conditions of those who have bestowed that enormous trust and responsibility upon us. We must take pride in ourselves and in our institution. I am confident in the fundamental honesty and dedication of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The members of the House today meet and exceed standards of personal conduct that are higher than at any time in our history. I recognize that controversy still exists in some areas, and will address them. I have asked <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> to join me in asking the bipartisan task force on ethics to complete their work with deliberate speed so that the House can consider these issues in this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in this session, in this year. The greatness of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> comes from its members working collectively to address the nation's problems. No parliamentary body can survive for long without the basic comity and trust necessary for us to address the nation's problems in a constructive way. I do not believe we can successfully undertake our public responsibility by tearing down this <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, by abusing its institutions. We can not tolerate the continuance of the current distrust and suspicion and expect to fulfill the public's expectations. After 25 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, there should be no doubt that I am proud to be a Democrat. I am deeply conscious, however, of the obligation I bear as speaker of the House. I am speaker of the whole <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, not of one party, but to each and every member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, undivided by the center aisle. I pledge to protect the right and privileges of all members. I will seek the consultation, advice and counsel of leaders and members, and I will welcome expressions of concern from all quarters of the House. I have suggested to the Republican leader that we meet more frequently to discuss business. He has encouraged more orderly and early cooperation on developing the weekly program, and I welcome that suggestion. Together, we reiterate our commitment to the work of the ethics task force, so that we can put this divisive period behind us.

 We warmly extend the same respect to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has offered to work with us in a spirit of bipartianship. I applaud the president's pledge of cooperation and am eager to accept it. Without the cooperation of both branches we will not solve pressing national problems. Politics involves the clash of ideas, and we will inevitably have disagreements. We must be careful that our desire for comity and bipartisanship does not deter us from considering contentious issues and debating them vigorously. But we must be able to conduct our political battles in an environment of respect for ourselves, for our opponents and for the House. We can not allow political differences to become foils for personal antagonism. Let us debate and decide with intensity, even passionate intensity, but let us debate and decide with respect, not rancor. A dozen years ago, Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> stood before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> prepared to take the oath of office for the first time. In his speech, he paraphrased certain principles outlined by the great <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> that should guide the speaker. He promised to be prompt and impartial in deciding parliamentary questions. He pledged to be patient, good-tempered, and courteous toward individual members. He pledged best to employ the talent of the House for full and fair consideration of issues that come before us. He pledged in those `` moments of agitation from which no deliberative assembly is entirely exempt to remain cool and unshaken, guarding the permanent laws and rules of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from being sacrificed to temporary passions, prejudices or interests.'' I repeat that pledge to you today. You have bestowed upon me a great honor and a great responsibility. I will devote every ability I have to maintaining your confidence and the integrity of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and to protect the rights and welfare of all members so that we can fulfill our high responsibility in representing the people of this nation. With God's help, and with your understanding and support, I am now prepared to take the oath of office.

<HEAD>Rigid Backslapping and Old-Shoe Chumminess: The House's Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> turned over authority with handshakes and backslaps, with wisecracks and children in the members' benches Tuesday, giving its new leader a chance to draw a contrast with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. There were still bitter partisan words spoken in the lobbies of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> whose wounds have not yet healed, but <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s cordial assumption of power as speaker and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s surrender were cited by <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> himself as symbolic of the values of the House `` We are proud to call this the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Taking note of the street struggle in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the grasping for democratic formulas in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could draw satisfaction `` that the values that gave this institution its birth and which have flourished here and sustained us for two centuries now sweep the world.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does these things its own way, with a mixture of rigid ceremony and its customary old-shoe clubbiness. A voice familiar from State of the Union night bellowed out, `` Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>! The speaker-elect, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>!'' The doors parted and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> marched down the handshake route. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, having surrendered the speakership, left the dais and joined the Democratic ranks. Along the way, he passed six children, members' kids, here for the history of it all, one of them trying out his sunglasses against the bright lights and another twirling a sailor's cap. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, accused of ethical impropriety, announced last week that he was innocent but quitting, a victim of `` mindless cannibalism.'' At <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s instigation, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> accepted a standing ovation. His eyes glistened. Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> made a joke of his own inevitable defeat for the speakership. The Republicans dutifully nominated him; the Democrats nominated <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>; the reading clerk called out the names; the Republicans voted for <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> and the Democrats for <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who won, 251 to 164. When the outcome was announced, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said he had become `` distressingly expert'' at having been outvoted in these speakership elections _ it was his sixth _ and he hoped for the day when the Democrats might be in the minority and learn `` the joys of such selfish behavior.'' The Democrats have been in the majority for 35 years, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said, serious now, and so long a stretch of uninterrupted power `` can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity.'' Moreover, he said, `` the distingushed members of the ethics committee,'' who had been about to pass judgment on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> when he short-circuited the process, `` are neither mindless nor cannibals.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had spoken of `` mindless cannibalism'' in his resignation speech last week. So, not far from the surface, rancor remained. At the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucus which had nominated him, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> urged rejection of two possible <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> courses toward the Democrats _ the `` kiss and make-up alternative'' and `` the French Revolution alternative in which we knit the names of evil Democrats into a waiting list for the political guillotine.'' From the back of the room, some junior members replied musically. They hummed _ loudly _ the French `` Marseillaise.'' Nor did the day's sweetness suppress the Democrats' ire. Some Democrats aver the Republicans are engaging in `` ethics wars'' which so far have forced <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> out, forced <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the party's zealous whip, to quit rather than face an ethics investigation and spread suspicions about another rising Democrat, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, whose Memorial Day visit by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents quickly found its way into the newspapers. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., told reporters leaking such news was `` unjustified character assassination. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., accused GOP National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> of spreading venom while in the White House was `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> being kind and gentle, <PERSON> George </PERSON> saying, ` Let's do horseshoeing, let's do barbecues.'

Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> used its reports to convey the official line on the weeks of student protests. The agency's silence seemed to indicate that neither the conservatives who ordered Saturday's military crackdown nor the liberals who opposed it are in a position to dictate a new line The nationally televised evening news was narrated entirely by off-screen voices with no anchor and even skipped the usual introduction: `` Viewers, this is the news broadcast. These are the main stories.'' Much of the 30-minute newscast was taken up by timeless feature stories from other cities. It also replayed a video from traffic monitors at several intersections in the city showing stone-throwing and other attacks by civilians against troops arriving to enforce martial law. There were no shots of troops firing on civilians. The only substantial news from television or any other official media Tuesday was a statement by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Yuan Mu that nearly 300 people had died and more than 7,000 were injured. State-run television also said 32 people were arrested, most for allegedly attempting to set fire to buses. Yuan was shown sitting at a desk facing several rows of local officials in a small meeting room, the first look inside the government since Saturday. The television later broadcast a news conference by Yuan with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> journalists, in which he urged them to do their work well even though newspapers have not been distributed since Saturday. His comment implied that some newspapers continued to print editions even though they were not being delivered or sold on the street. <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> did not broadcast its daily English-language newscast on Monday or Tuesday night, and all stations ended their programming early. Telephone calls to television stations went unanswered. Many Chinese reporters had closely followed the weeks of student pro-democracy protests that led to the May 20 declaration of martial law and Saturday military attack. But since Saturday none have been seen on the streets.

 House Republican leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> on Tuesday turned a normally ceremonial goodwill gesture toward the new speaker into a scolding for the majority Democrats. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., was elected speaker to replace <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who resigned rather than continue his battle against charges that he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules on outside income <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> carried forth the tradition of introducing <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and then took it a step further _ reflecting increasing frustration and pressure within Republican ranks after more than a third of a century of Democratic control. `` Thirty-five years of uninterrupted power can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity,'' said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, whose name was futilely put in nomination by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> for the sixth time.

 Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said Tuesday he was anguished by the failure of his fellow Anglican clergymen to allow women to become priests, and he likened sex discrimination to apartheid. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the first black to lead the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, commented during a meeting of church officials.

 Drenching rains continued to stall field work in the parts of the nation while additional rain was needed in some other areas where subsoil moisture is still low, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Strong thunderstorms over the weekend brought heavy rains and flooding to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and northwest <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, where three to five inches of rain were reported. `` Heavy rain also fell on the western <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>,'' the department's 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Drought </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly review. `` Scattered showers over the western Corn Belt brought rainfall of up to one inch in eastern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>.'' Persistent rain was reported in the eastern Corn Belt, with amounts of two to four inches in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-day outlook for June calls for near-normal to above-normal rain throughout the nation except for below-normal amounts in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the report said. In another report, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments said that corn planting nationally was about 93 percent completed by June 4, four percentage points behind normal for the date. Planting continued to lag in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> but was complete or nearly complete in the other major corn states. Winter wheat, which suffered greatly from drought in many areas since it was planted last fall, was reported in `` mostly fair to poor'' condition. In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, where the crop was hit hard by the dry weather, winter wheat was turning color and beginning to ripen. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the harvest was 8 percent completed, about 15 percentage points behind normal for this time of the season. `` Rain slowed <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s -LRB- wheat -RRB- harvest and reduced the quality of the unharvested crop,'' the report said. `` In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphids and wheat streak mosaic were continuing problems in the panhandle.''

 Republicans boycotted a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting Tuesday to protest a Democratic-led probe into the background and truthfulness of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice as ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The investigation's focus is <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s possible link to the Iran-Contra affair. The key questions: Did <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> assist <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret mission to illegally resupply the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and is he lying about it now? Democrats said they may fight the boycott by holding up <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominations to fill key <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and diplomatic posts As the new tensions surfaced in a long-simmering dispute, the absence of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members prevented the committee from acting on a $ 4.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill. Also pending was a $ 11.5 billion two-year foreign aid authorization measure. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, the target of the committee's investigation, served as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential national security adviser. On Tuesday, eight Democrats gathered to discuss the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bill. The only Republican who showed up was Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the panel's ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member, and he walked out. A quorum of 10 members is necessary to permit the committee to act on pending legislation or nominations. `` It's very apparent that we are unable to do business, that the Republicans are objecting to the fact that a legitimate committee inquiry is taking place into <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. Complaining of `` wholesale boycott,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> told his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues: `` I would hope the comity of this institution would not lead to legitimate business being held up.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who is leading the <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> investigation, complained that a lack of cooperation from the administration is in itself delaying final action on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> `` Late last month I sent several letters to administration officials asking for documents and information relating to <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` I not only have received no material, I have received no response.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said that the boycott is being organized by Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., who, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said, wants a specific date set for holding another hearing on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and a specific date for voting on his nomination `` I do n't want anyone suggesting we're holding up anything,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` We've got a vendetta going on against Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. That's been clear from the beginning.'' `` This is an attempt to dredge up Iran-Contra,'' said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` I'm having a problem on my side because of their discontent over what Senator <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> is doing.'' At that point, Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, attempted to move for action on the pending measure. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> stood up. `` I'll see you later, Mr. Chairman,'' he said. `` I've got to defend my side.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> then walked from the room. After huddling with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> told reporters that if Republicans want delay, they are likely to get it. `` We may not determine anything for awhile,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` This committee may not have any hearings on anything, including <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. ... If this committee ca n't meet on anything else, maybe the committee also ca n't meet on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>.'' The White House and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have been urging quick actions on a nummber of the pending nominations, including those of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> to be assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to be assistant secretary of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> complained that nominations confirmed to date have been done so with little or no help from Republicans. `` We have to carry water for the administration,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. `` Their own side is not carrying water.''

<HEAD>ACLU, Gay Groups Question AIDS List Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposal to collect the names of New Yorkers infected with the AIDS virus was condemned Tuesday by gay rights groups and the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> as a move that could turn those needing help away from medical attention. `` Our feeling is that anonymity has been the cornerstone of success in AIDS strategy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. No matter which direction the epidemic goes, that should not be changed,'' said <PERSON> Clarissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. `` If it is, it will drive people underground, away from the health care that they need.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> cited statistics from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as backing her assertion. After the state required the health department receive the name of anyone testing positive for the AIDS virus, the number of tests dropped 50 percent. Under the plan proposed Monday by city Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the city would collect the names of people testing positive for the virus in order to contact sexual partners or people who shared needles. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is now one of eight states where anonymous records are kept of people who test positive. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s proposal, made at the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, prompted members of the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Unleash Power to disrupt his speech by standing with their backs toward him and screaming that the commissioner was a liar and murderer. `` You are going to drive us underground!'' ACT UP member <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> shouted at <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> during an exchange at the conference. While <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said he felt confidentiality could be protected, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said his group has been opposed to such name-collecting plans since they were first proposed. `` The problem with keeping lists is the potential for confidentiality violations and possible prejudicial treatment. These are our civil liberties concerns,'' said <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s plan received endorsement Tuesday from <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, who called the proposal `` an extremely responsible public health measure. `` This will go a significant way to protecting the public, especially women in the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who are being infected at a four times greater rate than heterosexual men,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Sailors on the battleship USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> said Tuesday they are ready to return to sea even though <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators have not found the cause of a gun turret explosion that killed 47 crewmen in April. `` We'd like to shoot those guns,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, a fire control crewman aboard the battleship. `` It's like falling off that horse. You've got to get back on it. The longer you wait, the more you're going to think about it. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON>, a ship spokesman, asked that crewmen's last names not be used because the ship may run into danger during its cruise to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and seven other <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewmen and spouses took a break from preparing for a six-month deployment that begins Wednesday to talk at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Naval Station. The crewmen and the spouses were in good spirits about the deployment, the ship's first since the April 19 explosion in gun turret No. 2 killed 47 crewmen during a training exercise. `` The wives that I've spoken with are very supportive of this deployment, possibly even more so than ordinarily,'' said <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, wife of the ship's senior chief. `` Deployments are hard ... whether an accident's been involved or not,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, who stood at a pier beside the ship with her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, a machinist's mate second class. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewmen for four years, said the crew's morale was fairly good. `` I've seen it higher but it's not too bad,'' he said. `` We've got a lot of work to do We do n't have time to sit and mope about what happened.'' Along with the usual preparations for six months at sea, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crew had to clean and make minor repairs to the No. 2 turret. That turret must undergo about $ 13 million worth of repairs, at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> after the ship returns, before its 16-inch guns can be fired, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The ship's other 16-inch guns also will not be fired until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> completes its investigation of the accident. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> will be able to use its six five-inch guns and surface-to-surface missiles. The No. 2 turret will be used during the cruise to train new crewmen who replaced the sailors who died in the explosion, <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON> said. The crewmen said they have discussed the various theories about the explosion that have appeared in the news media, including reports that one of the turret crewmen may have caused the explosion to commit suicide. `` You're going to have a lot of talk,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON>, a petty officer 2nd class. It's just something that we just put out of our minds and we just go about our daily work. But you ca n't forget and you've got to wonder yourself, too.''

<HEAD>Drastic Tightening of Ceramic Pitcher Standard Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it planned a 50-fold reduction in the amount of lead permitted to reach beverages from ceramic pitchers because of new evidence that extremely small amounts of lead can hurt children. Lead at concentrations tolerable by adults can limit body growth and intelligence of children and can cause brain damage and behavior problems. Lead in pitchers comes from the glaze commonly used to make ceramics smooth and impervious. Officials are most concerned about acidic liquids like orange juice eating away at the glaze and causing lead to leach. Small cream pitchers would not be subject to the new standard since they are not used for acidic liquids. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is proposing to allow pitchers to be sold only if they leach no more than 0.1 micrograms, or one-tenth of a millionth of a gram, of lead per milliliter of an acidic test solution. Currently, pitchers are allowed to leach up to 5 micrograms of lead per millileter. The proposal also would require that high-lead decorative and commemorative ceramic plates have fired into them a permanent warning that cautions `` Not for Food Use _ May Poison Food,'' or have holes so they ca n't be used for food. The current standard was set by <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in 1979 based on recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. However, as a result of the recent studies, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and the WHO have reduced their recommended maximum levels. The proposed regulation was published in the Federal Register last Thursday. After a 60-day comment period, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will issue final rules.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seek to Save Owners Billions in Bailout of Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several House Republicans and a Democratic subcommittee chairman united Tuesday behind an attempt to save owners of 150 to 240 savings and loan facilities billions of dollars in a bailout of the industry. The effort was aimed at weakening legislation demanded by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and pushed through several committees by liberal Democrats to make S & amp; L owners put $ 6.4 billion more of their own money at risk as a price for the $ 143 billion bailout, the biggest in the nation's history. Of 10 proposals to reduce the amount of new capital that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would have to raise, an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., appeared headed toward becoming the vehicle for opposing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan when the bill reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor next `` Of the amendments that deal with that issue, I think it is the most precise,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Calif., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The committee spent most of Tuesday deciding which of 109 offered amendments will be allowed to be taken up when the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debates and votes on the 290-page bill. Another meeting was scheduled for Wednesday. In addition to the capital standards, the rules panel was expected to approve floor consideration of an amendment by the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to add the $ 50 billion immediate taxpayer share of the bailout's cost to the federal budget deficit for the next three years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed financing the government share of the bailout through long-term capital bonds that would add only $ 4.5 billion in interest costs to the deficit in fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991. And administration officials have vowed to recommend that he veto any measure that tampers with the financing. Republicans also were demanding floor votes on amendments to undo a pair of administration-opposed housing measures added to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s package by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. One would make S & amp; Ls subsidize low-income home mortgages by $ 75 million to $ 150 million a year. The other would give poor families first crack at buying some of the tens of billions of dollars in residential property that has fallen into the government's hands as the result of defaults on loans by insolvent thrift institutions. Both of the housing measures as well as making the bailout's costs part of the federal deficit were rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which passed its version of the bill in April Other amendments appeared headed for floor votes in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> included putting a cap on government borrowing for the bailout and restoring proposed $ 1 million-a-day civil penalites for bank fraud and other S & amp; L crimes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had demanded the $ 1 million civil penalties to discourage fraud and embezzlement, which has been blamed by government officials for more than half of the estimated $ 100 billion in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L losses over the past five years. However, in response to an intense lobbying effort by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and other trade groups, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago amended the bill to allow civil damages of only twice what the government has lost as a result of the wrongdoing. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the financial institutions subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, complained that bankers and other financial officers will be able to escape civil fines for fraud if examiners catch them at it before the losses become severe `` How can we favor almost meaningless penalties for financial crooks?'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said, seeking a floor vote on an amendment to restore <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. But the biggest fight was over the capital requirements. And on that issue, <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> was at the forefront with several <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans in endorsing <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s amendment to weaken <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s proposal would make the government go through lengthy judicial hearings before requiring newcash infusions from 241 S & amp; Ls granted so-called `` supervisory good will'' exemptions from capital standards in the early 1980s. The exemptions, some extending for as long as up to 40 years, were granted to then-healthy S & amp; Ls for taking over failing thrifts at the government's request. The purpose was to preserve the solvency of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees depositors against losses up to $ 100,000 each. `` This policy saved the American taxpayers over $ 13 billion at the time,'' said <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>. He added that `` virtually everyone agrees that these mergers never would have taken place but for the fact that good will was part of the bargain. Due process and fundamental fairness are concepts that can not be tossed aside simply because of the latest crisis.'' However, supporters of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to make S & amp; L owners put up their own money as a `` cushion'' between possible future losses and the government's deposit insurance funds, said good will has no cash value. `` You can not count air has hard cash and good will is just air,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Two Studies Contradictory On Airline Hub Concentration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two major studies of the airline industry put radically different slants on the impact of airline hub operations on competition and air fares. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to be released at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing Wednesday says airlines charge an average of 27 percent more per passenger mile on flights to and from 15 major hub airports than at other airports included in the study. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained an advance copy of the study. But a study by the airline industry released Tuesday says average airline fares have decreased since deregulation of the industry in 1978 and fares at 30 hub airports are only 1.5 percent above the industry average. That study says hub fares are a little higher primarily because hubs tend to have more non-stop flights. Both studies are to be discussed on Wednesday at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, Science and Trasporation subcommittee on aviation, which is examining the airline practice of feeding many of their flights through a single airport. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which is the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, concludes the trend that has seen major airlines dominating flights at airports where they set up hub operations has decreased competition. `` Many travelers have less choice among airlines as more markets are being controlled by a single airline,'' the study says. The report says that although the number of destinations served from hub airports studied increased 10 percent between May 1985 and May 1988, most of the increases were by dominant carriers and were offset by large service reductions by other carriers. At 13 of the 15 hubs studied, average air fares per passenger mile were higher for dominant carriers than for other airlines serving the same airports, the report said. `` Hubbing generates important operating efficiencies, but it can also lead to substantial market power for the airlines, which could lead to higher fares and reduced levels of service,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said in testimony prepared for the subcommittee hearing. The industry study conducted by the aviation consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Simat </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helliesen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Eichner </PERSON> concludes that competition in individual markets has increased despite the greater concentration within the industry and at some airports. The study commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents major airlines, concludes there is little, if any, relationship between average fares and airline concentraiton at either hub or non-hub airports. `` The hub and spoke system has evolved into a highly competitive national transportation system which provides enormous benefits to the American public,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaronson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> president. The <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> study says better service, such as more non-stop flights, account for average fare levels at some hubs that are higher than the industry average. But, in analyzing the study, the association said passengers are not hostage to the higher fares because cheaper options are available, including multi-stop flights or connecting flights. Airline schedules at 25 non-hub airports show they are now served by nearly twice as many airlines as in 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> study said. The <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> study includes charts which show that in 1978 nearly half of all airline passengers traveled in markets where a single carrier had 70 percent or more of the flights, but in 1988, only 20 percent of passengers traveled in markets that were served by only one airline. `` The growth of the number of hubs and the expansion of service at them have had astonishingly beneficial consequences for the typical spoke community,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Police chiefs who support gun control do not represent police in the field, a group of officers from around the country who oppose limiting access to semiautomatic assault-style weapons said Tuesday. About 225 officers brought to the Capitol by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> from 49 states _ <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was not represented _ held a news conference before fanning out to pitch their views to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They were here to combat the impact of law enforcement officials such as <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Behan </PERSON>, who are pushing for controls on the assault-style weapons, including semiautomatic versions of the AK-47 and Uzi. Law enforcement groups that have taken similar stands include the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> and the Police Executive Research Forum `` Often you, as news media, hear from the chiefs, the appointed officials, and they say they speak for us,'' said <PERSON> Patrolman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm here telling you this morning for thousands of us out there that the chiefs, the appointed officials, do not speak for the law enforcement officers that are in the field, in the trenches, doing the job.'' But <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said his organization represents 200,000 police officers, not their bosses. `` The Fraternal Order of Police does speak for the cop on the street,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` There's no chiefs, there's no sheriffs. They do n't speak for anyone except for the cops on the beat.'' Attending the news conference to express support for the officers brought in by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> were Reps. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss., <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON>, R-Mont., as well as Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> Lt. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> noted that many of the officers attending were `` under direct orders from their police chiefs to disassociate themselves from their respective police departments.'' `` Some of us are here with our chiefs' blessings, and some of our chiefs are hoping our planes go down on the way home,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` The remarks that are made here should not be construed as the official policy of our respective police departments.'' Officer <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said it `` offends me'' that some law enforcement leaders say police are being `` outgunned'' by criminals with assault-style weapons. `` Some of those administrators who are saying that are repeatedly saying that policemen are afraid, that the policemen are outgunned, that we're losing. ... We did n't come to this job to lose, and we do n't want anybody saying we're losers,'' he said. `` We go out there. We use education, training, tactics and good common sense. And we win,'' he said. The officers said they feared moves to limit access to the weapons was just the first step toward disarmament of the population. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> noted that in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> unarmed demonstrators were gunned down by army troops.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s political will, read to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament, sternly criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a `` vile state terrorist'' and said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders must be concerned with serving Islam and the deprived. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> read excerpts Monday on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. On Tuesday, state television broadcast film of President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> reading the testament to parliament on Sunday. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> was chosen Sunday as caretaker leader. It was not known whether <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> read the entire 29-page document, which official media said was dated Feb. 15, 1983, with another page added in 1987. They did not say what was contained in the extra page. Those parts of the will made public said nothing of who should govern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but contained general observations on how to choose the leaders. `` My will to the leadership is that they should occupy themselves with serving Islam, the Islamic republic, the oppressed and the deprived,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> read. `` They should not think that leadership is an egotistical gift. ... It is a heavy, dangerous responsibility. If the experts in choosing a leadership council or leader consult with prominent theologians and independent scholars, many problems ... will not arise.'' There has been speculation that, in the absence of a single political figure of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s stature, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may be ruled by a collective leadership. The testament said the president and members of the parliament should come `` from a class that has felt the deprivation of the oppressed and will work to better their conditions,'' not from `` the well-off capitalists and landlords, drowned in pleasures and excesses.'' Earlier, official media carried these excerpts: `` I have done my duty, which is to give guidance. My hope is that you will listen to this advice, which will reach you after my death and is unstained by the desire for power, and save yourself from God's wrath. `` There should be no doubt that the Islamic revolution of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is separate from all other revolutions, in the quality of its struggle and in its motives. `` I have not said and I will not say that today, in this republic, the great Islam and all its aspects are being implemented and that ignorant and disorderly individuals are not committing acts against Islamic laws. `` But what I do say is that the legislative, judicial and executive branches are trying and will try to do a great deal to make the country Islamic.'' It is `` better to be wiped out honorably from the face of history by the hands of criminal Americans and Soviets ... than to have a super-comfortable life under the red flag of the East and the black flag of the West,'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> declared. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had no greater source of pride `` than the fact that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> with all its huge military arsenal and string of puppet regimes and the international mass media at its service, has been so disgraced and humbled against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that it does not know to whom it should resort.'' <PERSON> Khmomeini </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should guard against `` the conspiracies and plots of the enemies towards the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. In the forefront of these is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, this vile state terrorist, which has set fire to the whole world, and its ally the global Zionist -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB-, which to attain its goals commits such crimes that pens are ashamed to document and tongues are ashamed to recite.'' Of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, his foe in an eight-year war, and some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders who supported <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, he said: `` We are proud that our enemy is <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>, whom friends and foes alike recognize as criminal, and violator of international and human rights. And everyone knows that his treachery to the nation of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and the gulf sheikdoms, is not less than his treachery to the Iranian nation. `` The Islamic countries and the oppressed of the world are proud that their enemies are this Jordanian <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> the carpetbagger and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> are followers of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the criminal.'' His references were to the kings of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the president of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.

 A 400-pound bomb packed into a hijacked van shook the city center Tuesday, injured three elderly women and heavily damaged a multimillion-dollar complex under construction, police said. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, fighting to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, claimed responsibility in telephone warnings to local businesses, police said. They were evacuating the area when the bomb exploded 40 minutes after an armed man forced his way past security guards and abandoned the van in Castle Court complex, a police spokesman said. The $ 94 million complex was to open next spring. A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb disposal team arrived minutes before the blast but did not have time to defuse the device, police said. The huge explosion shattered windows in surrounding shops and offices. Three women, all in their 70s, were treated in the hospital for cuts and shock, the spokesman said. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the province's senior British official, branded the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> `` godfathers of unemployment.'' `` What on earth is the purpose of carrying this out?'' he asked. `` It is destroying jobs, destroying buildings and destroying the future for many people and their families.'' Lord Mayor <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Empie </PERSON> said he was to meet more than a dozen British retail executives Wednesday, and `` I have less than 24 hours to think up reasons why they should still come to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>.'' It was the third <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb attack on the complex. A small bomb exploded on a crane and two soldiers from the locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> were killed when a bomb exploded in front of the building in February 1987.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> on Tuesday to express sympathy for victims of the deadly gas explosion along the <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Siberian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> and to offer a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> burn specialists. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could send a team of 14 doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one of the nation's most respected burn centers. `` I just want you to know it's available ... They could be ready to go immediately,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>. The ambassador thanked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the `` generous offer'' and said he would relay it at once to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` You've had more than your share of terrible luck,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, mentioning both the freak weekend gas explosion in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains and the devastating earthquake earlier this year in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. At least 190 people died, 762 were hospitalized and another 250 were missing in the Sunday incident in which two passenger trains were engulfed by a wall of fire from a ruptured gas pipeline, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet news agency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> that the Soviets could take or decline the team of burn specialists as they wished. `` This is an offer and it may or may not be something you would want to accept in the final analysis,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Soviets Boost Record Buys of U.S. Grain By 400,000 Tons</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and sorghum for delivery this year under a long-term agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The grain, 300,000 tons of corn and 100,000 tons of sorghum, is scheduled for delivery through Aug. 31. Sales were handled by private exporters under terms of the current long-term grain supply agreement between the two countries. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s grain purchases have been at record levels for weeks, far surpassing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s recent buying surge. Officials said the latest sales boosted total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and wheat sales to the Soviets in 1988-89 to a record 20.5 million tons, including more than 15.9 million tons of corn and 4.6 million tons of wheat. The sales also include 442,500 tons of soybeans, 1.35 million tons of soybean meal, and more than 1 million tons of grain sorghum. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, meanwhile, was the American wheat farmer's leading foreign buyer in the 1988-89 marketing year, with purchases of about 8.3 million tons. In addition, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought about 2.9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began June 1, including 1.8 million tons announced by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of corn sold to the Soviets would be about 11.8 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.49 per bushel at the farm level, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 29 million. The sorghum, also at 39.4 bushels per ton, recently has been about $ 2.20 per bushel and would be worth approximately $ 8.7 million. Wheat sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been subsidized under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. But the corn and other commodities are not subsidized. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had been a regular wheat buyer under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> but has not bought any under the subsidy program since April 6 when 300,000 tons were reported for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year, said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Nollmeyer </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But since then, she said, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought about 2.6 million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery. All of that has been at non-subsidy prices, even though <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still has about 910,000 tons remaining in its EEP account. World grain prices have risen significantly in the last year, resulting in lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidy rates. At one time under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, the wheat subsidy was more than $ 40 per ton, or around $ 1.08 per bushel. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most recent <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> deal, the subsidy was $ 6.33 per ton, or about 17 cents per bushel.

 Imprisoned black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was allowed a visit Tuesday from <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, the highest-ranking <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> member at liberty in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, 78, received unexpected permission for the visit after being turned down several times since his release from prison in November 1987. It is not known what the veteran black nationalists discussed because <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> is barred from being quoted by the press. No other source of information was available. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> spent about 2 -LCB- hours at <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Verster </PERSON> prison farm in <LOCATION> Paarl </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, but the exact length of his meeting with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most popular leader was not disclosed. The two last met shortly before <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> was freed. They were among eight <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for plotting to sabotage the government. <PERSON> Farida </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid activist from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, said she was with <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> when he received a telephone call Tuesday morning informing him the visit had been approved. `` He was very thrilled,'' she said. Rumors of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s possible release have been circulating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for more than a decade, and the government gives no firm indication of its plans. However, the decision last year to move him to a suburban-style ranch house on a prison farm revealed the special status he has even as an inmate. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 70, has refused offers of freedom on condition he renounces the use of violence in the fight to topple the white-led government. There is speculation that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> may be released after national elections in September for whites, Indians and people of mixed-race. The 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> was freed unconditionally because he was ailing, but a month later was placed under harsh restrictions prohibiting him from leaving his hometown of Port <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> without permission. He has been allowed periodic visits to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> for medical treatment.

 The world's largest prefabricated power plant began a slow journey Tuesday under tow up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the same body of water that it eventually will use to generate electricity. Cables groaned when two tugboats in front pulled and two tugs in back pushed the massive power plant, the <LOCATION> Merrimac </LOCATION>, off a dry dock at a suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> shipyard to begin its 208-mile journey upriver. `` I feel real good. I've been working on this thing for 13 years. We started literally from scratch,'' said <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Catalyst-Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydroelectric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the investors. `` It's been exciting for everybody. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> videotaped the 12-story beige structure as it edged away from its dock. About 75 spectators cheered from the dock. The power plant is 12 stories high, 456 feet long and weighs about 25,000 tons. Company officials said that although the <LOCATION> Merrimac </LOCATION> is smaller than some of the world's largest ships, it is believed to be the largest structure to ever travel up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The Merrimac is headed for a point 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Vidalia </LOCATION>, where it will be fitted for operation in a channel where water will run from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> through the power plant turbines and into the <LOCATION> Atchafalaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s first hydroelectric plant should be fully operational by July 1, 1990, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION>, an engineering firm that worked on the $ 500 million project. The Merrimac will creep upriver at 2 to 4 mph and should arrive in northeast <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> over the weekend, he said. `` This is a major milestone,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` It's been thought out extremely well. Saving anything less than a hurricane, we ought to be able to bring it in without any trouble.'' The major obstacle is already anticipated _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 190 bridge at <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. The bridge is too low for the tall structure, so the plant must be partially submerged while it passes underneath. The Merrimac will probably be sunk 40 to 50 feet to leave a clearance of at least five feet between the top of the plant and the bottom of the bridge. The 10 - to 20-hour process will be done by pumping water into large hollow compartments that enable the structure to float After the plant clears the bridge, the water will be pumped out and the <ORGANIZATION> Merrimac </ORGANIZATION> will resume its journey. Once in place near the Old River Control Structure, the <LOCATION> Merrimac </LOCATION> will divert water from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> through eight giant turbines. The water will then flow through a two-mile-long channel into the <LOCATION> Atchafalaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a 17-foot drop. The plant is designed to generate 192 megawatts of electricity, enough to light a city of 200,000 people. Owners of the power plant are the <ORGANIZATION> Merrimac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The town of Vidalia shared licensing for the project.

 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s two main Shiite Moslem factions issued statements Tuesday endorsing President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who was chosen as caretaker leader after the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. New shelling began after nightfall in the 3-month-old artillery war between Christian army units and a a Moslem alliance of Syrian troops and Druse militiamen. No casualties were reported. `` We declare obedience to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and swear absolute commitment to his teachings and orders,'' said a statement issued by the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is the umbrella group for militant Shiites believed to be holding some of the 18 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The rival Amal faction, a more moderate group backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, said it `` supports and blesses the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in its correct selection of the great successor <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> is only a middle-ranking cleric, but is being called `` ayatollah'' since his choice by the Assembly of Experts established by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to handle the succession. Shiites mourned <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> for a third day with a general strike in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other Moslem areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 86, died of a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after intestinal surgery. Black flags and photo posters of the bearded, black-turbaned revolutionary patriarch dangled from buildings and mosques in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the southern slums and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> towns in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Mourners marched to the Iranian Embassy in the seaside <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> suburb and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> religious centers in other cities to deliver condolences. `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the great Satan,'' read a banner carried by about 200 mourners in the southern port of Tyre. A dozen youths in the Bir el-Abed slum beat their chests and shaved their heads as worshippers entered the district's mosque for a memorial service. The <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, run by rightist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias, broadcast <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s funeral live. Cars equipped with loudspeakers toured the streets in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and Tyre urging businesses to close, and most complied. `` Close! Close!'' a bearded man shouted from a white Peugeot that drove across west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> commercial street flying the Iranian flag and blaring verses of the Koran. `` Sure, sure,'' a grocer replied as he lowered his shutter. The car drove away and the grocer murmured: `` Last year it was a strike to mark the Israeli invasion's anniversary. I wonder whether we'll be alive next June 6 to observe a strike for any reason.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew most of its army from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985, ending three years of invasion and occupation of the south. With the aid of a surrogate militia, it maintains a `` security zone'' just inside south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that ranges in depth from 6 to 10 miles. Palestinian guerrilla factions marked the anniversary by issuing statements condemning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Police said nine people were wounded in overnight artillery exchanges, raising total casualties to 363 killed and 1,430 wounded since the artillery duels began March 8.

 Elderly Americans are being ripped off by representatives appointed to handle their Social Security checks, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel was told Tuesday, but lawmakers and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration disagreed on how to reform the system. An <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> woman and a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> woman misused <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> payments that they had been entrusted to manage on behalf of elderly beneficiaries, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging was told at a hearing. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, testified that she was told by the government that she needed a representative to handle her disability benefits because she was incapable of managing the money herself. But she said the woman who was appointed kept some of the benefits for herself, and had a history of writing bad checks. She did not identify the woman. A similar story was told by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <PERSON> Marvell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, who said her representative collected her disability benefits, then refused to use the money to buy a telephone, clothes or other necessities that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> requested. `` She often would not tell me how much money she would have of mine, or what was going on,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. About 4.6 million Social Security beneficiaries have mental or physical impairments serious enough that they require a `` payee'' to manage their benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> accepts applications from anyone who wants to be a payee, but gives preference to relatives or to public or private groups with good records in handling elderly affairs. But Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said the government has been too lax in overseeing the `` There is some evidence that <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> has not been keeping a close watch on those who apply to be representative payees,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. `` Presently, the <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> does not do background checks, nor does the <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> monitor the program to ensure that the beneficiaries actually receive their money.'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Enoff </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> deputy commissioner, said the administration recognized there was a problem, and was evaluating steps to remedy it. He said the victims represent a small percentage of often poor, uneducated or handicapped people who are without relatives to care for them. <PERSON> Enoff </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> verifies the identities of payee applicants, and asks them whether they have felony convictions. He said he was concerned about a bill introduced by <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> on Tuesday that would require <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> to conduct criminal background checks on applicants, while barring most creditors from becoming payees. A ban on creditors would be too stringent and would keep, for example, helpful landlords from becoming payees, <PERSON> Enoff </PERSON> said. Still other possible safeguards in the bill are not yet feasible, he said. `` Ultimately, we plan to automate pertinent data on payee applicants, including past misuse activity and felony convictions, but the extent to which this can be done requires further investigation, analysis and systems development,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fed Apparently Easing Credit Policies as Economy Slows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a year-long effort to fight inflation with high interest rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> appears to be taking its first steps toward easing credit policies, many economists said Tuesday. These analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers had apparently become convinced the economy had slowed sufficiently to ease inflationary pressures. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which at times has been openly critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s previous tight-money policies, reacted to the apparent change by saying the administration had `` utmost confidence'' in the central bank. Starting in March 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had pushed short-term interest rates up by 3 percentage points in an effort to fight inflationary pressures by raising the cost of consumer and business borrowing and thus dampening demand. But in a sign of an apparent shift, a closely watched barometer of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy, the federal funds rate, declined on both Monday and Tuesday. The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other to make overnight loans. The central bank influences the rate through daily decisions on how much money it will make available to the banking system. The federal funds rate, which had been averaging between 9.75 percent and 9.88 percent, fell to around 9.63 percent on Monday and dropped further to around 9.56 percent on Tuesday. `` We feel the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is easing and I expect they will allow the federal funds rate to drop even further,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, director of economic research at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. He predicted a host of business and consumer loans would be headed lower in the months ahead as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loosens credit in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession. On Monday, major banks announced they were cutting their prime lending rate by one-half percentage point to 11 percent, the first reduction in this benchmark lending rate in more than a year. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said he looked for the prime rate to fall to 9.5 percent over the next three to six months, reflecting in part the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s easier money policy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief economic adviser, refused to comment specifically on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had begun driving interest rates lower, but he expressed confidence in the decisions of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers. `` We in the administration have a great deal of confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to make sure that we do n't let the inflation genie out of the bottle on the one hand while making sure that we do not overdo monetary tightening and throw the economy into a recession,'' he said during an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had openly criticized the central bank for being overly concerned about inflation while disregarding the threat that high interest rates could topple the country into a recession. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said Tuesday that it made sense for the central bank to err on the side of fighting inflation in January and February when inflationary pressures were higher. But he said current signals showed that the jumps in consumer prices earlier in the year were related to temporary boosts in food and energy costs and had not become embedded in the economy. He said also there were many signs that economic growth was slowing to a more sustainable pace. `` We have more balance now and we seem to be getting some slowdown,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said. `` I have utmost confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>.'' Analysts said the May unemployment report released last Friday probably provided the final bit of evidence the central bank needed to decide that it could begin loosening its credit grip. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, but it was accompanied by a sluggish increase in the number of jobs the economy created. Former <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would move cautiously in lowering interest rates until it was more certain that inflation was under control. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be cautious because we are not entirely certain that our inflation problem is behind us,'' <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> predicted that mortgage rates will drop further as inflationary fears ease in financial markets. Fixed-rate mortgages dropped to a national average of 10.48 percent last week, down from close to 11 percent at the beginning of May.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday marked the 45th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> invasion and called for redoubled efforts to help spread democracy around the globe. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a statement on the anniversary of D-Day, linked the current stuggle in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the Allied invasion that hastened the liberation of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1945. `` The turmoil and confusion of battle that day belied the calm purposefulness with which freedom confronts tyranny,'' the president said. `` In recent days, the face of the world has again been marked by dramatic occurrences _ winds of change _ that signify the determination with which freedom confounds its adversaries,'' he said. He recalled that on the morning of June 6, 1944, Gen. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> `` carried in his pocket a draft message declaring the invasion to have been a failure and taking personal responsibility for that failure.'' `` He never needed to use that draft, of course,'' he added. `` As with Gen. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> then, we can not know with certainty today whether the forces of freedom will prevail soon or in every instance,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Yet the ultimate victory of freedom and democracy is inevitable.'' He said last week's successful <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, as well as `` the first free elections in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in more than 50 years and even the momentous, tragic events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> give us reason to redouble our efforts to continue the spread of freedom and democracy around the globe.''

 The House of Representatives elevated <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to be the 49th speaker in its history Tuesday, and he immediately appealed to both parties to `` put away bitterness'' after months of turmoil that led to the forced resignation of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> promised to help return tranquility to a House that has been ripped by charges and counter-charges of ethical impropriety, and to put ethics reform on his list of priorities for the year. `` I am a proud Democrat,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> declared to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after he was elected and sworn in. He appealed to Republicans as well as his own party to `` come together and put away bitterness and division and hostility.'' `` We need to debate public issues vigorously, even passionately. But we need to debate and decide with reason and without rancor,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was elected on a party-line vote of 251 to 164, defeating Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The vote, in a crowded <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber, marked the first time a party has changed speakers in the middle of a congressional term because of a controversy over ethics. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, in his concession speech, said, `` I'm all for putting an end to bitterness. I'm all for putting our House in order. But we do n't do it by sweeping things under the rug.'' In a final shot at <LOCATION> Wright </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said members of the ethics committee who had investigated him were `` neither mindless nor cannibals'' _ a reference to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s call last week for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to end the `` mindless cannibalism'' he saw around him. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> preached conciliation all day. In one session with reporters, he refused to rise to the bait as he was asked repeatedly about <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> criticism of him by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is led by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he would not get into `` debating matters with Mr. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. I want to put this House ... and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> squarely back on a track of dealing with the issues that the country elected the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to resolve with the president.'' He commented after joining other congressional leaders at a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting on environmental legislation _ and after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> congratulated him on his new position. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and every way that I can work cooperatively with him, and my colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, I want to do so,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who turned the gavel over to his successor, praised him before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> session as a man who could turn the chamber's attention from backbiting to lawmaking `` My great hope is that the House can return to its most important business of legislating,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, adding that `` vigilantism ... just begets more bad will.'' Aides in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office packed files and mementoes into boxes, and workmen hauled them off. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spent the afternoon in his office as <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and other congressional leaders went to the White House. At a news conference after he returned, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he was asking two bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task forces, one on ethics and the other on campaign reform, to make their recommendations as soon as possible so legislation could be considered `` in this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, this year.'' A ban on congressional speaking fees, linked with a federal pay raise phased in over several years, could be a possibility, he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the party's majority leader for the past 2 -LCB- years, had been nominated unanimously by Democrats. Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., who also is resigning from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because of ethics charges, called <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> `` a man for all seasons _ a man uniquely suited for this season. `` There is a steadfastness, an inner serenity to this man,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who also made a nominating speech for <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> in the caucus meeting. But Democrats were having a hard time forgetting the relentless assault led by Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., that led to the fall of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, now the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> whip, formally filed charges against the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat last year, triggering a year-long ethics committee probe that cost more than $ 1.5 million and led to allegations <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules 69 times. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> fought the charges for months, but announced last week that he would resign not only the speakership but also his congressional seat. Of the ethics commttee and <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who himself faces ethics allegations over a book-promotion deal, <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON> said: `` I want them to treat him fairly, but I certainly want them to treat him.''

 The promotion of Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaves other leadership gaps his party hopes to fill quickly. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who had held the post of majority leader, succeeded <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> Tuesday, six days after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> announced he would step down because of charges that he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules on outside income But the next in line for <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s No. 2 post, Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., also is resigning _ rather than face an ethics inquiry like the one that ended <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s career So both the No. 2 and No. 3 Democratic slots in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> need filling. With Democrats eager to put the ethics episode behind them and limit any political damage, a party caucus has been scheduled for next Wednesday on those races. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> is widely considered the favorite to succeed <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as majority leader. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination last year, is considered a strong spokesman for the party without any potential ethics issues in his background. Opposing him is Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, one of the more conservative Democrats. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, is a popular member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and he enjoys the backing of that panel's chairman, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` It's a good competition without acrimony,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said Tuesday The race for the title of majority whip narrowed to three already-powerful Democrats on Tuesday when Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., announced that he would not be a candidate Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, currently chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, is considered the front-runner. However, he's been battling published reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a preliminary investigation of his personnel practices including an allegation about a no-show employee. He has denied any wrongdoing and has questioned the timing of leaks that occurred just as he was running for whip. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s remaining opponents in the race are Reps. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the chief deputy whip, and <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> wins, his caucus chairmanship will be vacant. Two lawmakers, <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, have announced they would like to succeed Gray. The death last week of Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., also made vacant the powerful post of chairman of the Rules Committee A <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus was scheduled for Wednesday to put Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in that position. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> has announced he will leave the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on June 15, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also has said he will give up his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> seat this month. With Pepper's death, three House seats long held by Democrats will be up for election.

 The Communist government, demoralized by its crushing election defeat, again urged victorious Solidarity on Tuesday to join a governing coalition _ a proposal the union has turned down. `` It is time for a broad post-election coalition, a kind of pact for economic reforms and democracy,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON> told a news conference. A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Monday that Solidarity should show `` co-responsibility for the country.'' Politburo member <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> later told Polish radio, `` The voters' verdict shows all political forces, that is my -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party, other coalition parties, groups and Solidarity must undertake responsibility for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future.'' But Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said earlier: `` We did not fight for chairs -LRB- in the Cabinet -RRB- for ourselves. We fought for a different system of wielding power in this country.'' In Sunday's election, the independent union movement won an overwhelming majority in the new 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and virtually all of the 161 seats available to the opposition in the 460-seat <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the existing lower house. But the most bitter defeat dealt to the Communists was with the `` national list.'' That list had 35 top party and government leaders running unopposed for the Sejm, but the candidates had to receive a least 50 percent of the vote. It appeared that many ranking officials on the list, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, would not receive 50 percent because millions of voters scratched their names from the list. The victorious union said earlier that the Communists and their allies could have all of the 299 <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> seats allotted to them under the April agreement that legalized Solidarity again and provided for the elections. <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON> did not say what kind of coalition the Communists envisioned and that question must wait until the new parliament convenes after June 18. <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> suggested various forms for such a coalition, ranging from some kind of parliamentary cooperation to Solidarity paritipation in the government. `` Results that we know are certainly bitter for my party and they must make her think very deeply, make deep reflections, draw all conclusions, no matter how deeply and how far they would go,'' <PERSON> Orzechowcki </PERSON> said. Solidarity has declared that it would not seek more power than it was granted under the April accord. One seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and seven in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may have to be settled in runoff elections on June 18, said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizgajska </PERSON>, a member of a Solidarity committee tabulating results. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regards Solidarity's apparent victory as a victory for all Poles. Yesterday's concession by the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was statesmanlike and commendable. `` We welcome the reaffirmation of the party spokesman that the Polish government will continue democratic and economic reforms. We welcome <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s call for hard work by all sides to find solutions to the country's economic and political problems.'' The Polish government spokesman said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> will offer his resignation and that of his Cabinet in keeping with tradition when the new parliament is seated. But there was no indication whether <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, named prime minister in September, would actually step down or shuffle his cabinet. The government said its poor showing was due to `` pent-up emotions'' and complained about unreasonable propaganda against the `` national list.'' Loss of the list could mean that such leading figures as <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and eight members of the 17-member Communist Party Politburo will not be seated in parliament. Under law, the rejected officials can keep their regular government posts, but it would be a blow to authorities' prestige and the legitimacy of one-party rule. Many voters Sunday expressed pleasure at being able to cross off leaders responsible for the Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown that suppressed Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the union considered itself bound by the April 5 agreement in which it agreed to allow the government a full 65 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, or 299 seats. `` We have a lot of problems to solve in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. We have to respect the round-table agreements. It's the platform from which we started,'' he said `` Let's reject emotions and get on with solving problems.'' Authorities should be allowed to fill the vacant seats among the 299 in any manner they wish, Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and union adviser <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> told a news conference. `` We await what kind of proposals or solutions will be taken by the other side,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said. One such solution might be a new election to fill the seats. There have been no details on what <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> meant when he suggested a coalition in a speech Friday night. Any such deal could open the path to a sharing of power unprecedented in the Soviet bloc, where communist parties have maintained a monopoly on power since the late 1940s. The next government will be formed by a prime minister named by the president, a new post created as part of the accord between Solidarity and the government. The post was widely expected to go <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> due to the majority guaranteed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies in parliament. But after Solidarity's solid victory the opposition might propose a counter-candidate.

 A prominent Soviet writer said during parliamentary debate Tuesday on nationalist unrest that soldiers covered up ethnic violence three years ago in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. The debate in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies took place at a time of more ethnic troubles, this time in the Central Asian republic <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. At least 50 people were reported killed over the weekend. Writer <PERSON> Mukhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakhanov </PERSON> said a letter from intellectuals in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> charged that soldiers used dogs and shovels to disperse protesters and that the number of deaths has been kept secret. That protest was the first in a long series of ethnic disturbances under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness and social and economic reform. <PERSON> Sakhanov </PERSON> summarized the letter, then turned it over to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during Tuesday's session. It said the number of deaths in rioting in the republic's capital, <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, was greater than the 32 killed last year during violence last year between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis `` According to incomplete data, about 3,000 people were arrested, hundreds of them were sentenced to long prison terms, thousands were excluded from schools or fired from work,'' said the letter written by seven Kazakh intellectuals. Copies were circulated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by Kazakh activists. The violence in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, the Azerbaijani capital, was caused by a dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, an enclave in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> whose population is predominantly Armenian. The territory was assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923, but <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> wants to annex it. On April 9, troops battled pro-independence demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the capital of the Georgian republic, and at least 20 demonstrators were killed. The use of shovels and a debilitating gas by soldiers who broke up that protests has caused national outcry. The Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> also have been beds of unrest as activists press for more autonomy. Official reports have said that only a couple of people were killed in the Kazakh rioting, which broke out after the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Dinmukhamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunaev </PERSON>, an ethnic Kazakh, was replaced by Russian <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbin </PERSON> The letter demanded a legislative commission be formed to investigate the rioting. Also Tuesday, Russian writer <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasputin </PERSON> characterized the dominant <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> population as a victim rather than master of the vast Soviet bureaucracy. Ethnic minorities blame centralized control on domination by Russians in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Rasputin </PERSON>, of the Siberian city <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION>, said the system had `` plundered <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> to such an extent that it is just on this side of survival.'' He complained that when Russians begin talking of their own national culture and traditions, they immediately make other ethnic groups wary. Members of the newly formed Soviet of Nationalities, the house of the Supreme Soviet legislature that is assigned to deal with ethnic questions, also met Tuesday and debated the ethnic unrest issue. It named the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON>, as their chairman after questioning him about the violence in his republic. Of 252 deputies present, five voted against <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> and 11 abstained. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, presiding over the chamber, said the tone of some of the debate `` leads to concern,'' but that he was satisfied with it. `` I'm very pleased because of the informal character of discussion,'' he said. He said the house can not duck hard questions. `` This is the people's life and we have to approach it seriously,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The Soviet of Nationalities met after a morning session of the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Lithuanian deputies demanded veto power over selection of the chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities. When the house refused to go along a deputy who did not identify himself raised the possibility of Lithuanian secession. `` This is a constitutional right, and I do not want my native <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to be in such a bad union if it goes like this,'' he said. Deputy <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarovoi </PERSON> complained to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that Estonian officials were discriminating against others. Reform in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> is `` a one-way street where there is no place for Russians,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials and lawmakers clashed Tuesday over legislation calling for U.S.-Soviet negotiations to ban the superpowers' production of plutonium, the material used in nuclear weapons. Under questioning from members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> panel on <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> nuclear facilities, administration officials also conceded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the ability to detect work at <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> reactors that manufacture plutonium. `` Do n't we have the technical ability to pick up a large-scale plant in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>?'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., one of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of the International Plutonium Control Act After calling the question difficult to answer in an open session, <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s acting assistant secretary of energy for defense programs, said: `` We can determine if the facility is operating or not operating. Period.'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, testified before the panel on behalf of the legislation that seeks to compel the administration to pursue the negotiations by threatening to block operation of some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons facilities. Identical bills introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> say that six months after enactment, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be prohibited from operating any of the facilities dedicated to production of plutonium for military purposes unless he certified one of the following conditions: _ The Soviet government refuses to negotiate a ban on plutonium and highly enriched uranium _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is unable to determine whether the Soviets have halted production, or _ The Soviets continue to get plutonium by operating civilian <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities geared to plutonium operation are either mothballed or closed permanently. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 14 reactors produce enriched uranium and plutonium for the nuclear arsenal although last month <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced that he would shut down by the end of the year three of 14 reactors that produce enriched uranium and plutonium for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal. `` The many congressional co-sponsors of the International Plutonium Control Act have, in effect, asked the administration to call Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hand on the plutonium issue and negotiate a mutual and verifiable end to production,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said that when Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> early last month, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader expressed a desire to work on a bilateral agreement on controlling production of all `` weapon-grade fissionable materials.'' `` We should call his bluff,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> told the committee. But <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, argued against the legislation, saying the absence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities dedicated to plutonium production versus the more than 10 Soviet reactors would force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to negotiate from a position of weakness. In addition, `` this legislation would undermine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capability to make strategic nuclear materials in support of our nuclear deterrent. Hampering our capability to produce nuclear weapons before we cease to rely on them is dangerous and destabilizing.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> noted that the Soviet nuclear program does not separate military and civilian facilities while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does. If the Soviets decided to `` break out'' of the ban, they could `` send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors home, and turn their facilities and plutonium stockpile to weapons purposes.'' The administration argument prompted Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbray </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Nev </LOCATION>., to question whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have to `` build up its capacity so we can break out. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> responded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must negotiate from strength, saying that was the case on the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles. This exchange prompted questions from members as to the amount of plutonium the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has, with Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, saying he believes that `` we are awash in plutonium.'' But <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, who declined to provide statistics, saying the information is classified, said: `` I do n't feel awash in plutonium myself.''

 Only days after some units of the Chinese army attacked thousands of unarmed demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, citizens poured into the streets on Tuesday to give a hero's welcome to other units. The astonishing contrast represents the sharp differences in loyalties and backgrounds among the various factions of this nation's fighting force. The 27th Army, based in <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province, is reviled and feared in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for shooting hundreds of people and smashing the student demonstration in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. But the 38th Army, which normally is responsible for defending <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, is now considered a force that has come to drive the 27th from the capital. Its troops were greeted Tuesday with loud applause when they entered the city. People rushed forward to give them cigarettes and shake their hands. The intentions of the 38th in entering <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> remain unclear. But Chinese and diplomatic sources widely agree the army group has come to end the killing and possibly to drive the 27th from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Details are sketchy on the number of soldiers involved in the three or four armies deployed in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> area. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is organized into about 22 Group Armies, such as the 27th or 38th Each has about three divisions and totals about 40,000 soldiers. According to some information, less than half of each army has been deployed in the city. The Group Armies of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are roughly equivalent to a Western army corps, which normally has two or more divisions, plus auxiliary troops. The London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> estimates the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military has more than 3 million men and women on active duty, with about 2.3 million in the army. The 22 Group Armies are spread among seven designated regions of the country. The army is overwhelmingly comprised of conscripts. Peasants are drafted and almost always go to Group Armies in their region and stay in that region. When Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> on May 20 declared martial law, the orders are believed to have gone to the 38th Army to suppress the pro-democracy students. Astonishingly, it appears to have refused to obey orders, perhaps because many of its recruits are <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students and its officers have close personal and professional ties in the city. Its commander is said to have been arrested for insubordination. Instead, the 27th from <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province was given the task of smashing the student unrest. Most of its soldiers are poorly educated youths from rural areas who have been isolated from and have little understanding of the democratic goals of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students. More important, the commander of the 27th is widely believed to have family connections to President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, a former general and a ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, an ally of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, has led the hardliners demanding a tough stand against the students, and was instrumental in the reported ouster of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who favored making concessions to the young activists. The 27th Army now appears to be on the defensive. Along with the 38th Army, the <ORGANIZATION> 28th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is reported to be entering the city. An army from <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, apparently the 64th <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> also is said to be in the area and is thought to have links with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. There already have been skirmishes reported between soldiers of the 28th and 38th with men of the 27th. The clashes are possibly a prelude to a major battle to drive the 27th out of the capital and end one of the worst crises in communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. Less than half of each corps is thought to have been deployed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. So far they have shown mainly tanks and armored personnel carriers, but the groups are also equipped with anti-aircraft and artillery regiments. Factional fighting has a long tradition in Chinese history, going back to the warlords who constantly sought military advantages over their neighbors. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> which led the Communists to victory in 1949 gave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> a united fighting force, but <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> maintained geographical military divisions of first 11 and now seven regions. Regional loyalties, and interregional rivalries, were a natural outcome. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has always had a deeply political role in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, as epitomized by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s 1938 statement that `` political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'' During the first years of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s disastrous political upheaval, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, it was the regional armies that stepped in to stop civil war between leftist factions and restore order. The <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION>'s most disastrous attempt to interfere in politics came in 1971, when <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Biao </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s chosen successor, led a group of military officers in planning a coup against <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> the pig and <PERSON> Bilbo </PERSON> the hobbit have a lot to teach grade-schoolers if only more educators and parents would stop being afraid of fantasy literature, a professor said Tuesday.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> sought to make peace with <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>'s dominant <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and challenged sexual and family mores in this liberal nation. During a Mass attended by 13,000 people, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> condemned abortion and divorce as ravages of sin. It was the first time he raised the issues on his 10-day tour of <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, where attitudes on sex clash sharply with Roman Catholic teaching. Later, he attended a prayer service in the 12th Century Lutheran cathedral in <LOCATION> Roskilde </LOCATION>, where he was not allowed to speak. Some of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s Lutheran bishops had threatened a boycott if the pope addressed the congregation at <LOCATION> Roskilde </LOCATION>. But a public opinion poll published Sunday suggests opposing bishops were out of step with their congregations. The poll found 79 percent of <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> interviewed favored letting the pope speak at <LOCATION> Roskilde </LOCATION>, traditional burial place of the royal family. Nine percent were against and 12 percent had no opinion. The evensong service was a compromise. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> walked up the aisle of the vaulted church, blessing a few people along the way, and took a special seat to the left of the altar, where he followed the service in a program. Afterward, he met with the Lutheran bishops and told them the excommunication of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> should not be considered an obstacle to collaboration and dialogue between Roman Catholics and protestants. He acknowledged the years have not healed the `` deep wounds'' caused by the 16th century excommunication of the German priest who sparked the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformation </ORGANIZATION>, but said this can not be done `` through a juridical -LRB- church -RRB- act.'' Excommunication is the church's most severe penalty, which <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> explained is in force only during someone's lifetime. The pope praised <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> for his `` profound religiousness.'' `` Primarily today we need a common reassessment of the many questions raised by <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> and his message,'' he said. `` A reassessment from the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> side has already begun.'' <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> was excommunicated in 1521 for attacking widespread views that salvation could be earned by good works, such as paying for Masses, and indulgences to avert penalites in purgatory. Earlier, after his arrival from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told 13,000 congregants at a Mass that sin in today's world takes the form of `` a readiness to disregard human life or manipulate it without reference to the inviolable dignity and rights possessed by every human person from conception until natural death.'' Sin, he said in English, `` wounds even the most fundamental of loving relationships, that of marriage, by making us think that it is too difficult, if not impossible, to be bound to one person faithfully for life.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was speaking in a country where one abortion is recorded for every three births, and half the marriages end in divorce and abortions, prohibited by the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, are free. The pope previously was in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, and is to visit <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Saturday.

An army shooting at the people _ I just ca n't believe it,'' said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, 31, a graduate student from near <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. Another native of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said the violence unearthed buried feelings. `` I thought I'd totally settled here and adopted it as my country with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as my motherland,'' said <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien </PERSON>, 47, a senior consultant in the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> engineering department in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del.

<TEXT>
 The Contras on Tuesday again defied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and vote in February's elections, saying they will organize exiles and maintain their military strength. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has urged us to return as quickly as possible,'' said <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, spokesman for the Contra directorate's majority. `` But that is counterproductive ... it would be premature.'' Only one of the Nicaraguan rebels' seven directors, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, has said he will go back to his homeland without conditions. He is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> next week to begin preparations for national elections. The directorate is based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, which was chosen for its proximity to the Central American country and its large Nicaraguan community. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>'s action `` shows different criteria, and those are not the criteria of the majority _ we think it divides the opposition,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. The rebels, who are receiving only non-lethal aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will also resist pressure to disband their troops concentrated in Honduran camps just north of the Nicaraguan border, the spokesman said. `` If the elections are a fraud, and if they do not produce a constitutional, free, democratic country, the troops should be viable to take up the struggle again,'' he said. The Contra rebel groups were supposed to be reintegrated into civilian life under the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan approved by the region's presidents, but the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leadership has refused, accusing the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> of violating their guarantees under the pact. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has threatened to renew military aid to the Contras if the national elections are unfair. In an official statement announcing their electoral strategy, the Contra directors pledged Tuesday to deliver a minimum 250,000 Nicaraguan exile votes to the opposition in February. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s population of about 3 million includes 1.75 million voters, according to the government. But exiles would have to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to vote under the law, which the opposition is trying to change to allow voting in consulates. As many as half a million Nicaraguans have fled the war and economic chaos in their country, with most settling in neighboring Central American countries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Contra statement said the Contra leaders will not return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> until they have successfully concluded talks with the internal opposition aimed at unifying anti-Sandinista groups and settling on a single presidential candidate. The Contras will insist on a `` national dialogue'' to set conditions for February's vote, the statement said. `` With a unified opposition, the candidate should take the initiative to call all Nicaraguans back to support them,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. `` Returning before that would be premature.'' The Contras and the Internal Civic Opposition are meeting to establish such a united front, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. Asked how long the unification might take, he said `` we had hoped it would already be done,'' refusing to give a deadline for the talks to end. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have blocked the negotiations with a series of `` impediments,'' such as denying visas to participants to freely enter and leave <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 Coal miners seeking support for two strikes completed the first leg of a six-day march to the state capital Tuesday, camping at the site of a battle between union and government forces nearly 70 years ago. The miners on strike against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> expected to join up with two other groups of marching miners, plus machinists on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, for a multiunion rally Sunday at the state Capitol in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scheduled as a speaker. `` We'll be singing all the way. We're not calling this off for rain, sleet, snow or nothing,'' said <PERSON> Bethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Purkey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 5815 </ORGANIZATION>. About 60 striking <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members left their picket shacks near <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> early Tuesday on the 85-mile march toward <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, he said. The <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> marchers at mid-afternoon reached <LOCATION> Blair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, the site of a 1921 confrontation between federal troops and coal miners struggling to organize <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s mines. The miners lost that battle in a bloody era of the state's history, but the confrontation marked a turning point in the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s rise to The marchers planned to erect a plaque to commemorate the battle. `` They passed this way to win what they got, so we're passing this way to keep what we've got,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomblin </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sunday's rally is expected to draw representatives of almost every other labor union in the state. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> is scheduled to attend, but Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> is undecided. `` We're going to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to see what side of the fence the governor's on,'' <PERSON> Tomblin </PERSON> said. The miners who set out Tuesday are part of a strike in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> workers walked out April 5 after working 14 months without a contract. Another group of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners from the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> area in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> planned to join the marchers Saturday. A third group of miners on strike against the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at the company's <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> mine also planned to join the march Saturday. New Beckley miners have been off the jobs since January. The battle of <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON> was a result of a long history of poor miners trying to organize and coal companies working maintain a status quo. The UMW had been formed in 1890 but its attempts to organize workers in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> counties met with a coal company practice of firing anyone who joined the union and evicting them from company-owned houses. The conflict led to the `` Matewan Massacre'' on May 19, 1920, in which 10 people, including seven coal company detectives and <PERSON> Matewan </PERSON>'s mayor, were killed. The next year, <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, a defender of the union, was shot and killed at the <ORGANIZATION> McDowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> where he was standing trial for murder in connection with the Matewan shootout. Upon news of <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>'s death, miners gathered at <LOCATION> Marmet </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, for an invasion of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> counties and at <LOCATION> Blair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> met federal troops who had been called from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Three union men were killed and 40 men from both sides were wounded. The state brought 543 people to trial _ 22 on treason charges _ but the treason charges were dropped and all others were acquitted.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> Tuesday accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of encouraging cross-border Arab guerrilla attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by pursuing its dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Also Tuesday, Israeli troops fatally shot a 22-year-old Palestinian and a 14-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> died of wounds received the day before. Police fired tear gas in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to scatter <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> crowds that raised illegal <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> flags and shouted slogans at a funeral for <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla leader who died in prison. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spoke while touring the border near the Misgav Am collective farm, where guerrillas attempted to infiltrate from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Sunday. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and three guerrillas died in the shootout, the fourth in eight days on the frontier or in the Israeli-controlled `` security zone'' in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We do not think the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has changed its path, its nature,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told soldiers. `` The American contacts only strengthen their motivation to continue in these acts.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has opposed the U.S.-PLO talks since they began in December after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounced terrorism. The next round of meetings is scheduled to begin Thursday in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON>, 22, was fatally shot in the head in a stone-throwing clash with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lahiya </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Atuna </PERSON>, 14, of nearby Nusseirat refugee camp died after being shot in the head in a confrontation with troops Monday, the officials said. Throughout the occupied territories, army gunfire wounded eight Palestinians. The army confirmed the two deaths and two wounded and said it was investigating the other reports. The deaths raised to 508 the number of Palestinians killed in the 18-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The unrest has killed 22 Israelis. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Tuesday began issuing new identification cards that Gazans will have to show to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. About 50,000 Gazans work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Palestinians see it as a means of penalizing them for the uprising, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say it is to increase security. About 2,000 Palestinians took part Tuesday in the three-hour procession that carried <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>'s rough-hewn wooden coffin through the streets of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON>, 48, died of kidney failure Sunday after serving more than 20 years in prison for leading a commando raid across the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 1968. He was a politburo member of the Damascus-based <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s longest serving Palestinian prisoner. It was one of the largest pro-PLO demonstrations held in the Arab sector since the uprising began. Small children, many with faces masked with Arab scarves, waved outlawed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags. Other marchers shouted: `` With rifles we will continue the struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>!'' Helmeted riot police twice charged the marchers and fired tear gas. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said rubber bullets also were fired. No injuries were reported, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 20 protesters were detained. Among the marchers were three Israeli-Arab legislators. One, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahab </PERSON> <PERSON> Daraushe </PERSON>, told mourners: `` In spite of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s arrogance, the intefadeh will be victorious.

 Nations urged their citizens Tuesday to leave <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as troops continued random shooting on the streets, and some countries chartered aircraft to speed the evacuation. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged the 1,440 Americans in the capital to leave, and the 7,360 Americans who are permanent residents elsewhere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were advised to consider leaving. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said it was considering using chartered aircraft to evacuate Americans, an administration official said on condition of anonymity. But he said Americans did not appear to be in immediate danger. Hundreds of anxious foreigners jammed airline offices and swamped embassy switchboards with telephone calls for advice. Several thousand filled the small international departure area of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, many trying to buy tickets on stand-by. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, waiting with about 100 other British students and teachers to board a special <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> charter, recalled it was less than two months ago that students at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he studied, first demanded democratic reform. `` Who would have thought it would end like this?'' he said. Despite the turmoil, small numbers of foreigners continued to arrive in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on regular flights. About two dozen nurses from around the world flew in from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> late Monday to attend a nursing convention. `` We hope we wo n't be called into service,'' said one. Foreigners who have decided to remain behind rushed to stock up on food supplies at the few stores still open in expectation of prolonged violence. `` Do not go on balconies, look out the window or take photographs of troops,'' the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> warned in a handwritten sign tacked on its door. `` They have warned they will shoot. They mean it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which joined Tuesday in urging its nationals to leave <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, hung small <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags from the doors of its embassy vehicles and taped signs in the windows saying in Chinese, `` <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>,'' apparently hoping to discourage attack. Soldiers at some intersections have fired at any vehicles passing through. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, who did not want her name used, said staff members were telephoning all Americans who registered as residents in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to advise them to leave. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said it was reducing its embassy staff to a skeleton 15, down from more than 40 Canadians, but other countries such as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> said they were sending out only the dependants of embassy staffers. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON>, a second secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said employees of the embassy's trade section were leaving Tuesday via commercial flights but that other embassy personnel planned to stay. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> arranged special chartered flights for their nationals. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> was trying to send larger-capacity planes on its three-weekly flights to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The walled compounds where most foreigners live in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> took on an increasingly deserted look Tuesday. Few of the hundreds of Chinese who normally work in the compounds as drivers, cooks, maids and translators showed up. The women who normally run the elevators were absent, and several of the aged machines promptly jammed between floors. The Australian Embassy invited its expatriate staff to move their families onto the embassy's walled compound in a diplomatic quarter of eastern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and several dozen staffers left their apartments in a convoy Tuesday afternoon. Chinese witnesses reported small battles Monday and Tuesday between army units backing rival political factions in the top leadership, and fear of civil war prompted Tuesday's stepped-up exodus. `` Earlier -LRB- our advice -RRB- was, ` Keep your head down.' Now it's basically, go,'' said a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> diplomat

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor chick emerged from its shell Tuesday, marking the fourth captive hatching in the most productive breeding season for the critically endangered bird since 1984, officials said. Named Shasta for the volcanic <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mountain that was once a range for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land bird, the chick was helped out of its shell by keepers at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Animal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, said park spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON>. The egg was removed from its nest at the park's `` condorminium'' soon after it was produced April 9 by the parents of <LOCATION> Molloko </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mandan </LOCATION>, the first and second <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors to be born and bred in captivity. The bird's gender will be determined by a blood test, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. The hatching process began Saturday, when the chick pecked a hole in its shell. During the final seven minutes, keepers cracked away bits of shell until the 6.8-ounce chick was freed. `` This is the most productive year since 1984, when eight condor eggs were taken from the wild and six successfully hatched,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION>. He said a seventh condor was born in the wild that year, but five condor deaths in the wilderness reduced the net population gain to two. <PERSON> Shasta </PERSON>'s hatching raised the species' population to 32. It also represented the first successful `` double-clutch'' in captivity, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. Condors naturally produce a single egg each year but often lay a replacement egg if the first is lost early in the egg-laying season. All condors known to exist are in captivity _ 18 at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and 14 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. The goal of the program is to rebuild the population to the point where condors can be reintroduced into the wild. <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said keepers hope to release an initial group of condors in 1992.

 Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> easily captured the Democratic nomination for governor Tuesday, while four Republicans were locked in a close battle for a chance to succeed outgoing Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, who barely lost to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> eight years ago, trounced two rivals in the Democratic primary. With 9 percent of precincts reporting, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> had 19,356 votes or 64 percent, <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> had 5,680 votes or 19 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> had 5,195 votes or 17 percent. In an eight-way GOP race, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, who started the race as the frontrunner, led with 9,045 votes or 24 percent. Close on his heels were Attorney General <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> with 8,813 votes or 24 percent and state Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> with 8,736 votes or 24 percent. State Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> was fourth with 6,307 votes or 17 percent. Republican state Sen. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON>, who sounded a conservative theme, was running a distant fifth and three other Republicans who ran low-budget campaign _ <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Blomquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolyer </PERSON> _ trailed far behind. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, barred by law from seeking a third consecutive four-year term, made no endorsement in what became one of the state's closest <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries in recent history. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> in 1981 by 1,797 votes out of 2.3 million cast, deliberately kept a low profile on the campaign trail and refused to engage in much debate with his more liberal opponents. In <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, voters decided whether the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant should become the first such facility in the nation permanently closed by the electorate. The referendum on the troubled 15-year-old plant was non-binding, but the commissioners who operate it said they would abide by the results. Elsewhere, in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, Democratic state Rep. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditto </PERSON> was expected to best three token opponents in voting for mayor. And in <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, ousted Mayor H.T. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> tried to get his old job back. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, 86, who drew national attention last year when he declared `` National Voodoo Week'' in the southern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> town, was removed from office in August for abusing his pardoning power, willful neglect of duty and incompetence.

 All of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s major candidates agreed to accept public financing and limit their campaign spending to $ 2.2 million. That, plus Republican <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s decision not to endorse any of the four leading candidates also helped level the playing field. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s GOP race, <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> stuck to his theme that he alone was not from the state capital of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, and did not participate in creating the state's automobile insurance and budget problems. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> emphasized his seven years of experience as a top adviser and cabinet official in the <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> administration, saying he has experience making hard decisions and writing budgets. <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> appealed largely to the conservative wing of the Republican party and courted the pro-life and gun lobbies. <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> spent most of his time and money in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, aligning himself with <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and going after moderate voters. During a grueling four months of campaigning, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates confronted each other at roughly 30 different forums, including five hours of sometimes rancorous televised debates.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 100-0 Tuesday to urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to consult immediately with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies on imposing international sanctions against the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government `` to demonstrate abhorrence'' over the killing of thousands of unarmed students. The House earlier voted 406-0 to approve a resolution condemning the violence used against pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and commending the president for acting to end military cooperation with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution also commends <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and condemns `` the brutal use of force by the government of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> against unarmed advocates of democracy and human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' But it also urges serious consideration of steps that go beyond those taken so far by the president, including the consideration of international sanctions. These include: _ Calling on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to review financing of trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` in light of existing legal requirements for adequate human rights treatment and the deteriorating condition of human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. _ Urging those <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies charged with liberalizing procedures for export licenses for sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to `` take into account the current situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in making their decisions. _ Urging the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> to immediately increase Chinese-language programming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said the administration supported the resolution <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not control events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` it is within our power to express the views of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people clearly, unequivocally and unambiguously ... in total condemnation and denunciation of the actions that have been taken.'' `` We have witnessed a great leap backward in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` I hope it is not too late for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders to come to their senses.''

 As rival troops squared off in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leaders appeared to have left the capital and urged the 1,440 Americans in the city to get ut themselves. `` It's like the place is closed down,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` There's been no communication from the leadership. There's no indication who the leadership is.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> called the situation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` tense and unsettled.'' She acknowledged there may be dissension within the Chinese armed forces and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence source, commenting on the grounds of anonymity said, `` What we're seeing, first, is a political struggle, the outlines of which are very vague. Plus there is a serious division'' within the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leadership. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy has been in contact only with mid-level <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials but has had `` no contact with the top-level people _ and we've tried. `` The assumption has been that the top-level people have moved out to other locations. We tend to believe it.'' <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, meanwhile, referring to the shooting of hundreds of students demonstrating for democracy, told reporters: `` We have reason to believe that all elements of the Army do not support what is taking place. We have no firm evidence of armed clashes.'' The Chinese capital was threatened with civil war as armies loyal to rival political factions were reported battling in the city. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence source said his information was that <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had refused to move against the students in Tiananmen Square even as <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> elements from <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> carried out Sunday's bloody attack. `` We're hearing all the reports of shooting between <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units, but we have not confirmed that ourselves,'' the source added. An official, speaking on conditition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports reaching <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> estimated the death toll at 3,000, in line with estimates by diploatic sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> but 10 times the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government estimate. This official said the reports stressed the toll could go higher. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> decided to encourage Americans to leave <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after a long telephone conversation Monday night with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador there. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was told 50 percent to 75 percent of the employees of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms had already decided to leave. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said arrangements were being discussed with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to supplement their regular service from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with charter flights to carry out Americans. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that his airline had no plans to add flights. `` We're just operating our regular schedule'' of three flights a week, he said. Indeed, one <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said that regularly scheduled flights were proving adequate, so far, to handle the number of Americans leaving the capital. `` We can not order them to leave,'' the official said of the Americans choosing to stay. In other developments: _ A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official noted Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> has been allowed to take refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> The official, who requested anonymity, said <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, a 53-year-old astrophysicist who had been denied permission to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in February, `` took refuge for his own safety'' and has been at the embassy at least since Monday. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> not to move against <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> nationals whose visas have expired Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the visitors could stay indefinitely. Subsequently, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> issued an order allowing 73,000 Chinese students and 250,000 Chinese visitors and business travelers to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if they request one-year extensions of their visas. _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> announced it was suspending a cooperative exchange program with the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telex to <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangzhao </PERSON> that the exchanges were being suspended `` in outrage and sadness'' and that Americans `` are shocked and dismayed by the action of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government troops against peaceful demonstrators.'' _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted without dissent for resolutions condemning the violence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution urging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to consult <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies on possible international sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> On Monday, even after <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops assaulted the pro-democracy students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> encouraged Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> simply to stay in touch with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy or the four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulates. `` I ca n't point to any specific thing that happened,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said about the newest <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> guidance. `` Every day is different.'' Elsewhere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the 7,360 Americans who are permament residents were advised to consider leaving the country `` depending on the local situation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said they should not leave through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Additionally, the families of the 428 American diplomats and workers at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the consulates were given permission to leave the country. `` There is no drawdown of embassy officers,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` The embassy and our four consulate offices continue to operate fully.'' Apart from permanent residents and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, an estimated 4,000 Americans are traveling in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at ny particular time. Tourists were advised not to go there. `` It is not an order to leave, but we are encouraging them to leave,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said in reference to the advice the embassy was giving to the American residents of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Sources said telephone calls were being made systematically to all American residents of the capital, who had been asked earlier to make the embassy aware of their whereabouts. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> and the other officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that no Americans were known to have been threatened directly, but that the situation was too chaotic for them to safely remain in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suspended more than $ 600 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but stopped short of advocating economic sanctions, at least for now. The decision to encourage Americans to leave, however, could itself have a severe impact on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses operating in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and on commercial ties to the country.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sculpted the final contours of a catchall bill Tuesday rushing $ 3.3 billion to veterans programs, a shattered <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> telescope and a host of other projects and making pronouncements on policies domestic and foreign. Lawmakers had hoped their third day of debate on the legislation would be the last as they sorted through amendments to a `` dire emergency'' measure President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first proposed in March. But they bogged down over an amendment offered by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., to delay some of the new catastrophic care provisions for the elderly under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, including the surtax on people more than 65 years old designed to pay for the program Some senior citizens have complained about the tax, which can reach a maximum of $ 800 for the wealthiest of them. Democrats said catastrophic care changes should be made in separate legislation, and work on the bill was scheduled to continue Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected 69-29 an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to block aid to communities refusing to give work on public transit projects to companies that conduct business with the pro-apartheid regime of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It also adopted by voice vote a provision by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, calling on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to rework a tax law business considers burdensome. That followed a 50-49 defeat for Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., who instead wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to repeal the tax law, which forces companies to prove their health benefits are as generous to low-paid workers as they are to executives For procedural reasons, <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> would have needed 60 votes to prevail. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> called the provision `` unwise, unworkable and just plain unfair.'' Democrats agreed that the tax law needs revamping, but said revoking it would be a mistake. `` Is there any reason we should be favoring management?'' asked <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The legislation is aimed at providing extra money for the rest of fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. It contains $ 1.2 billion for veterans programs, $ 892 million for student loans, $ 342 million for the costs of last summer's Western forest fires, and money for efforts including foster care, refugees, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and food stamps. It also bestows federal money on a host of projects of a less sweeping nature, but championed by various legislators for local consumption. Thus, it contains $ 75 million to rebuild a 26-year-old <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> radio telescope that collapsed last November, sought by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Thanks to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., $ 275,000 would be set aside for <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to advise farmers on coping with drought Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, garnered $ 500,000 for engineering work on a lake in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that has filled with sediment. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s two <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, got $ 400,000 for a study of last summer's fires at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>. In a boon to senators from 39 states, the measure also supplies $ 6.6 million to continue subsidizing air carriers serving small communities. The legislation also carries provisions stating the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s views on an assortment of topics The chamber wants the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to buy more apples for the federal school lunch program to help the country's ailing apple industry, thanks to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's two senators, Democrat <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>.

The measure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially proposed was for $ 2.2 billion.

<HEAD>Court Bars State Water Flow Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appeals court ruled Tuesday that states can not regulate water flows from federally approved power dams, rejecting arguments from 17 Western states that had sought the authority in order to protect fish. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a presidentially appointed agency, has exclusive power under federal law to set standards for hydroelectric projects, including water flows needed to protect fish. The ruling, which upheld a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> decision, affects all types of water power projects, including larger utility-owned dams, which periodically must be relicensed. It is primarily important in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where small hydroelectric projects have flourished since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law in 1978 requiring utility companies to buy electricity from those projects when oil prices exceeded certain levels. The states, led by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, were supported by several environmental groups, which in written arguments to the court called hydroelectric development `` one of the greatest threats to our nation's free-flowing rivers.'' `` The states tend to be the most knowledgeable, the most sensitive to the resources at stake, and they have a major role to play'' in protecting fish and wildlife, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Echeverria </PERSON>, general counsel of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION>, which led a half-dozen environmental groups. The federal agency's position was supported by small dam operators and major utility companies, who said state regulation would disrupt hydroelectric development. One such project was the <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> dam, a 3,000-kilowatt project on a tributary of the South Fork of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> approved the dam in 1983 and required operators to maintain a flow of 11 cubic feet per second of water into <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> from May to September, and 15 cubic feet per second from October through April, to protect an important trout spawning ground. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, at the request of state fish and game officials, set flow standards in 1986 of 30 and 60 cubic feet per second for the same two periods, saying the lesser flows were inadequate to protect the fishery. <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> officials objected to <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled in 1987 that it had sole authority to set the flow rates. The dam was completed in 1986 and has operated under the federal standards. The other states supporting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s position were <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pinochet Warns Against Human Rights Trials Of Military</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said the armed forces will not tolerate human rights trials by special courts or the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after a civilian government takes over next march. The lame-duck military president also said he will remain as army commander after handing over power to a successor to be elected in national balloting Dec. 14. He said his continuing on an army chief was necessary `` to ensure <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s institutional organization.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s remarks came Monday at a meeting with <LOCATION> Chilean </LOCATION> women journalists and were carried by local newspapers Tuesday. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> can stay on as army commander for eight years after stepping down as president. The opposition vehemently opposes that clause, but the 73-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has refused to change it. Asked about allegations of human rights violations under his military government, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said he agrees `` some cases must be dealt with by the courts.'' But he added, `` I can not accept that members of the services be targeted for revenge or that special courts be organized in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' He hinted that the future democracy could be threatened if that happens. `` There would be a reaction against that'' from the military, he said, `` and I do n't want to even think what might happen.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, overthrowing an elected leftist government. Hundreds of leftists later were rounded up. Many were tortured or killed and thousands forced into exile. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and human rights groups here and abroad have documented the cases of about 750 people who disappeared after being arrested by security agents. Opposition leaders say they are not out for revenge but intend to find the truth about human rights violations and bring those responsible to trial. They insist their aim is to try individuals, not the armed services as such. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> emphasized that the armed forces have decided to return to barracks and move away from the political arena after 16 years in power. `` Now, I say so long, and It's your problem now,'' he said. `` It's over for me and for the army.'' He said the military was leaving in disappointment, considering the Chilean people as having been `` ungrateful'' to them. He referred to last October's national referendum in which voters overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal extending his term until 1997. The outcome obliged <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to call the December election. `` We received a country in chaos, and were are leaving a decent country,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Americans returning from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> recounted tales of horror, including one man who said he watched as troops opened fire into crowds of students and was shocked because `` I've never seen people mowed down, murdered.'' <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, returned from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Monday, two days after Chinese troops moved in on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tianmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, killing hundreds in the most violent suppression of a popular movement in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. The stockbroker and amateur hockey coach was on his seventh visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where he coaches children's hockey in <LOCATION> Manchuria </LOCATION>. He stopped in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on his way home. `` I saw one soldier go down on his knee _ maybe more than one, things were moving so fast ... and he started firing into the crowd,'' <PERSON> Lapin </PERSON> said. `` There was more than one soldier firing. My guess is there were four, five, six-thousand soldiers. `` They started firing indiscriminately into the students. I saw people falling ... It was chaos at this point. `` I was in a state of shock _ I've never seen people mowed down, murdered,'' <PERSON> Lapin </PERSON> said. `` No one thought this was going to happen. The students were just standing there with locked arms, some five or 10 deep. The feeling I got was that they were surprised. Everyone started running and screaming. `` I saw bodies lying there _ it had to be in the hundreds _ and I saw a tank roll over the bodies.'' At <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiedeman </PERSON>, a delegate with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said she tried to get to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> _ first in a taxi, then on the backs of bicycles pedaled by students. `` We were about two miles from the square when the gunfire started: there was no mistaking it,'' <PERSON> Tiedeman </PERSON> said. `` Then a wave of panic took place. I tripped, and then two thoughts came: One, I'm going to be shot, and two, I'm going to be trampled `` My friend threw himself over me and said: ` Stay down. Do n't move. When we got up, we saw about 20 dead people all around us,'' she said. Passengers arriving at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> said they were overjoyed to return to American soil. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that from her hotel room she was able to see the tanks approaching the center of the city. `` It was very frightening,'' she said. `` I could see the tanks coming down the street. I could see the guns. I could see the guns raise.'' At <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Helaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who was attending the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, was among several Americans returning from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I was really sorry to see what was going on there,'' she said. `` When the protests started and the demonstrations for democracy, there was lots of joy and goodness but it all turned to disaster this weekend. `` You see tanks in the street, places burning, you hear gunfire _ it's very, very frightening,'' she added. `` I had to leave but I'm sorry that I did. Ms. <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> said she had called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy for help in getting to the airport in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but was told she would have to get there on her own.

<TEXT>
 Foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday night to give a six-week extension to a team of mediators assigned to achieve a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The mediators are to report back to the foreign ministers before July 19. Tuesday had been their deadline for a three-week effort to work out a `` national accord'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that would lead to a `` transfer of power in the shortest possible time.'' Their was no indication, though, that the mediators had made much progress. Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> opposed the extension on grounds that it did not have the explicit support of the Panamanian government. Nonetheless, Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> raised no objection to the proposal, under which the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> will undertake a return mission to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a bid to carry out the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mandate. The agreement was reached in early evening after closed-door talks at the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> where delegates spent much of the day attempting to find common ground. After the extension was approved, <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> delivered a lengthy speech strongly criticizing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an `` imperial superpower'' which has systematically thwarted the non-interventionist principles of the OAS. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> must take account of charter provisions calling for the establishment of representative democracy as a guiding hemispheric principle. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> must show that the charter `` is not mere words,'' he said. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> assailed <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and said that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> must consider `` further action'' against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if progress toward democracy is not achieved quickly. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the problem,'' he said. But <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> maintained that a `` durable solution'' to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis was not possible as long as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops remain in the country and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not lift the sanctions it imposed against <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> 15 months ago `` There can be no normal political process under the current circumstances in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters after the four-hour <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting, elaborating on an earlier speech he made to the gathering. Much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission open-ended. The mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other delegates argued that an open-ended mission would ease pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, led by <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, had lobbied during the closed-door consultations for the mediators to report in 15 days but settled on six weeks. In a report on their initial mission to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the mediators contended that an extension of their <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mandate would be `` very advisable.'' There was no indication in the report that the mediators came close to achieving the goals of a resolution approved by the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission on May 17. Much of the five-page report was devoted to listing the names of Panamanians with whom the mediators met. The May 17 resolution criticized <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for the `` grave events and abuses'' which occurred during and after the May 7 national elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Amid widespread allegations of fraud by forces loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the government threw out the election returns, creating the crisis of legitimacy that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> has been attempting to resolve. There also were brutal attacks on some opposition candidates by government forces. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Sept. 1 is being viewed as a `` guidepost'' for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediators because <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is scheduled, under its constitution, to change presidents that day. Just who the new president would be is unclear because of the scrapping of the May 7 election returns. Opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillemo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> is widely believed by international observers to have won the election. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hand-picked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, also claimed victory <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, an opposition vice presidential candidate who is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting, said Tuesday he believes the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> should approve a resolution that shows `` respect'' for what he claimed was the 3-1 margin of victory by the opposition. `` We beat the dictator at his own game,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday announced a $ 10.7 billion takeover offer for publishing and cable giant <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which already plans a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount, an entertainment and communications company formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it offered $ 175 a share for all of Time's stock The announcment came less than three weeks before Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger agreement announced in March. The <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger plan calls for a stock swap that the companies valued at $ 18 billion and said would create the world's largest media and entertainment company <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said its board would review the proposal and advised its shareholders not to do anything until they heard from the company. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> officials had no immediate comment. Time, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and Paramount are all based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Time shares closed at $ 126 Tuesday in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, up $ 2.75. Paramount made its announcement after the market closed, and the company noted it was offering a price 60 percent higher than Time's share price just before the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal was announced There had been speculation for weeks that a bidder could emerge for Time despite its merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. But Time executives have privately insisted the company was not for sale. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who follows the entertainment industry for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, called it a `` fascinating situation.'' `` My feeling is that this is going to entail a much lengthier battle than Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had anticipated,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. `` Both companies were obviously in a rush to get this done as fast as possible for concern that someone could come in and upset the proposed merger.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said Time and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> `` are a superb business fit.'' He said the acquisition of Time would represent `` the culmination of a six-year strategic transformation of our company into a leader in publishing and entertainment, a focus reflected by our new name.'' `` Together we will be the foremost American communications company, capable of competing on a global scale against foreign media giants,'' he said. Paramount announced in April that it intended to sell its consumer and commercial finance business, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. It is expected the sale could produce $ 3 billion or more in revenue. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> has committed to provide $ 1 billion in financing for the offer and has said it is highly confident of its ability to arrange a syndicate of lenders to provide the rest. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he told <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>, that Paramount was willing to negotiate all aspects of its proposal. Paramount also said it would immediately withdraw its offer if Time shareholders approve the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> transcation. Both <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders are scheduled to vote on the proposed merger, a stock swap that the companies valued at $ 18 billion, on June 23. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> advised <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> in a telelphone call Tuesday evening that `` Paramount was launching a hostile offer for Time's shares.'' Time said the offer was `` in contradiction to explicit assurances Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had previously given Mr. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>,'' but did not elaborate. Time has indicated that it has a $ 5 billion credit line available to begin its own offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> or defend itself against a takeover. Paramount's entertainment interests include <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. It owns Madison Square Garden and two professional sports teams: the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knickerbockers </ORGANIZATION> in basketball and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> in hockey. It also owns the <ORGANIZATION> MSG </ORGANIZATION> cable Network and a 50 percent interest in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> cable network. In publishing, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster, <ORGANIZATION> Prentice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and Pocket Books. Time is the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magazine company, publishing such titles as Time, People, Sports Illustrated amd Fortune. It owns the book companies <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Foresman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Time-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

Pausing to lean on a car bumper, <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> recalled, `` I said, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, do n't you ever wonder where you came from? How all these people got here? Where I came from?'' The son wondered wearily, `` Dad, is this going to be another one of your jokes?'' It's often hard to tell whether <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> is about to produce, after tortured rambling, some great truth _ or just another one of his jokes. <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> has an hour-long TV special, and it is a treat, both for <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON>'s amazing musicianship and for his gentle, intelligent wit that seems to come from just across the kitchen table, not from up on stage in front of a couple thousand strangers. `` <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON>: Home & amp; Away'' premieres tonight on most PBS stations. Perhaps there is something in the water out there in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> that produces performers who tell engaging but circuitous and often surreal stories about just about anything. <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> turned that ability into an art, as well as a lucrative radio and book career. <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON>, who often appeared on <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s radio show, `` A Prairie Home Companion,'' is more upbeat than <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>, kind of like an aging kid brother who veered off temporarily into Zen Buddhism somewhere back down the line. He can be funny and deep at the same time, as when he recounts how his children, squabbling in the back seat of the car, were in fact displaying a propensity for a mystically defined notion of art. <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON>'s meandering stories are a nice juxtaposition to his mind-bendingly intricate instrumentals. His unique style is a fusion of country, jazz and folk influences. In the <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> show, he also offers up vocal renditions of such classics as the <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves-Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> love song `` Ring'' and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebel </PERSON>'s haunting `` <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doc </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> appear for a brief but rousing bluegrass jam session. The special was produced and directed by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Perillo </PERSON>, who has produced films for PBS' performance art series `` Alive From Off Center.'' Interspersed with elegantly spare concert scenes are video vignettes of <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> ranging around a guitar store in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, driving his car, shopping _ `` I keep lookin' for boots,'' he says, examining a display of the cowboy variety, `` but they're all pointy.'' _ and musing about the worth of motorboats, sitting in his own leaf-covered example, up on blocks in his yard. The concert footage was filmed in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. After the first number, <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> cheerfully explained to the rapt audience, `` It's really necessary by this time in the set for me to speak,'' and launched into a complex exposition on his tendency earlier in his 20-year stage career to become too involved in his own performance It seems he would drool on his guitar. He determined that this chagrined the audience and reformed. Later, driving across a sun-bathed <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> landscape, <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> chats with the camera, recalling a philosopher's notion that the creation of art has to begin with a lie. This recalls a back-seat ruckus between his two young children. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> let out a scream and informed her father that <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> had stuck his thumb in her eye. `` I did n't know that was your face,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> explained. `` My heart swelled with pride,'' said <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON>, `` because I knew I had an artist in the back seat.'' <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> takes the camera into his basement, where `` bad'' guitars are left to think about what they have done. He displays an ancient, oft-repaired old buzzard of an instrument that had been smashed in a car wreck, restitched, stepped on, held together with tape, reconstructed with a new 28-inch neck and then sawed off so it would fit in a regulation-size case, leaving it with 10 strings instead of 12. `` Despite all that,'' <PERSON> Kottke </PERSON> says gently, `` I'm still stirred by this instrument. And so is everybody else.

 Wrong is wrong. Drug abuse, for example. Racism, for another. What's not as clear-cut is how far <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> society should go to redress such wrongs. Some say recent responses go too far, jeopardizing the promises of the Constitution. Rights are rights, they say. AP reporters <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> examine the dilemma of societal wrongs and individual rights: a perceived threat to free speech as colleges fight racism, and worries about due process as police and politicians use evictions and other measures to fight drugs.

 Stung by an outbreak of bigotry on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campuses, universities are taking steps to curb bias even if that means curbing free speech. Civil rights advocates and civil libertarians, normally fast allies, have become adversaries as schools try to limit the views students can express and set penalties _ including expulsion in certain cases _ if those views slur female, black or other minority students. Such sanctions have stirred a bitter, highly complex debate within higher education: Are anti-bias curbs likely to help, or hurt? Are college campuses so different from the rest of society that students' First Amendment rights can be abridged? Are colleges abdicating their role as bastions of ideas, no matter how unpopular or even hateful? Finally, are anti-discrimination rules constitutional? `` I do n't believe freedom of speech on campus was designed to allow people to demean others on campus,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON>, director of the equal opportunity program at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which adopted anti-bias rules last fall. `` We just wanted to ensure that at a time when other universities were having problems that we made it clear that we would n't tolerate graffiti on walls or comments in classes.'' Many agree. At <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where white students displayed a racist caricature of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> near black students' rooms last fall, minority students have been pressing the school to enact sanctions for the past year. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, where a white fraternity held a mock slave auction last year, is considering anti-bias sanctions. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> is considering tightening existing ones. But last month a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> graduate student sued his school with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, arguing that a recently enacted six-page anti-bias code is so broad it violates the First Amendment. The student, identified only as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> in court papers, raised a hypothetical question: Do <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s anti-bias rules bar a male student from saying in class that men outperform women in a particular field? <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s policy empowers the school to punish students guilty of `` discriminatory conduct'' in classroom buildings, libraries and university housing, but allows for more uninhibited speech in student publications and open-air campus forums. It details behavior deemed discriminatory: any act that `` stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-era veteran status.'' Even <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s law school dean, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON>, wo n't bet on who'll prevail in the lawsuit. `` The case law on what speech can be restricted is quite unclear,'' he said. The constitutional debate centers on the so-called `` fighting words'' doctrine. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> coined the term in a 1942 ruling, <PERSON> Chaplinsky </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, which stated that the First Amendment did not protect `` insulting or ` fighting' words _ those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.'' The justices reiterated that view in <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in 1969, and in <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in 1973. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> filed a brief last March to the state board of regents and cited the `` fighting words'' doctrine as buttressing its proposed anti-bias rules. But in other decisions, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has protected students' rights _ even the right to protest the draft with obscene signs. In Tinker vs. <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, the court upheld students' rights to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War because the schools failed to show any evidence of serious disruption to the educational process. But such apparently pro-free speech rulings may also have sown the seeds for restrictions. By inference, the court indicated it might sustain free-speech curbs on campus, said <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON>, if schools can show that certain speech leads to `` serious disruption'' of education. A 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling involving a <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, principal who censored an article from his high school's newspaper held that `` a school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school.'' The Hazelwood ruling left unclear, however, whether that principle applied equally to colleges. At worst, civil libertarians fear a future where free-speech restrictions could turn <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s campuses into `` re-education camps'' where only right-thinking people feel free to speak out. `` Does this mean you eventually ban a <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, or a <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, because they might upset some students?'' asked <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbach </PERSON>, vice president and general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, the chief <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobby for higher education. `` Where are campuses going if they can not discuss issues openly, even in a provocative manner? If you erect these kinds of potential punishments, are n't you creating a chilling effect on free speech on campus? If I say the number of Jews killed during the Holocaust was overstated, am I baiting? Will I be judged post facto to have said something that is offensive?'' <PERSON> Steinbach </PERSON> said. But the slights and insults minority students say are commonplace at all-too-many campuses convinced at least one civil liberties advocate that anti-bias restrictions are needed. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> lawyer whose usual stock-in-trade is defending newspapers in First Amendment suits, wound up drafting <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-bias rules last spring. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said in an interview that his bedrock allegiance to absolute First Amendment rights was shaken after spending hours hearing black students at the <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> campus. They described, among other things, how they felt after racist jokes were broadcast over a university radio station last year. `` I think what tipped it for me was that I had been looking at the problem wrong,'' he said. `` I always thought that students ought to be able to shrug these -LRB- racial -RRB- comments off. But minority students are incredibly isolated on a mostly white campus. I was floored by the fact that minority students deal with this on a regular basis.'' To <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> and others, the essence of the debate gets down to what ideals universities ought to represent: `` Should the university be the place in society where there is ultimate protection of free speech, or is it a place where you want to preserve civility and discourse? Those are two very different models, both with strong appeals,'' <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> said. On at least some campuses, free speech and civility have become a very difficult mix.

 <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> lives by the law and tries to teach her two children to do the same. But when her 17-year-old son was charged with selling cocaine, it almost cost her family something very precious: their home. For three months, the <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, housing authority fought to evict the <ORGANIZATION> Goodmans </ORGANIZATION> from their $ 311-a-month apartment, saying the drug dealing _ which occurred miles away near other agency property _ violated terms of their lease. Ultimately, Ms. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> won her court battle. The 32-year-old seamstress, who testified she was n't aware of her son's actions and tried her best to control him, was bewildered. `` I felt like I was being prosecuted for something someone else did,'' she said, recalling her worry about being evicted. `` I did n't break any law.'' Her case typifies the growing efforts by law enforcement and political leaders to wage war on drugs with tactics _ evictions, raids, even criminal charges against pregnant women _ that have stirred new debate and sparked numerous lawsuits. _ In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, people suspected of drug involvement have been evicted without being convicted. A new <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> program asks landlords to include in leases a clause stating that anyone selling drugs will be evicted. _ In several states, prosecutors seek to convict women for using drugs during pregnancy. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> lawmakers recently passed a measure to permit doctors who suspect a pregnant woman is abusing drugs to test her without her knowledge; drug users are not punished but urged to seek treatment. _ In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, public housing raids have been conducted without warrants or tenants' consent. A suit also claims personal belongings were searched. A city alderman wants a law that would authorize the arrest of loiterers in areas where drugs are sold. Civil libertarians say these are grandstanding acts that victimize the innocent, discriminate against the poor and reek of McCarthyism. Beyond that, they say, they're ineffective. `` The war on drugs is really a war on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, whose rights are being invaded,'' said professor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisotsky </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` There's a mass invasion of civil liberties on the grounds it's necessary to win the war.'' `` Attempts to legislate away social problems are usually very unsuccessful,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fyfe </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> criminologist and former policeman. But frustrated prosecutors and politicians, pressured to act and act fast, say aggressive is n't necessarily invasive. There are enough legal checks and balances to protect the innocent, they say. `` I do n't see where anybody has the civil rights to use drugs,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. A grand jury recently refused to indict a woman he charged with involuntary manslaughter after claiming her cocaine use led to her baby's death `` If people are going to do drugs, sell drugs or buy drugs, they have to be discouraged in any way possible,'' <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> added. `` People who introduce this cancer or support this cancer have to pay a price. If it's losing housing, it's an appropriate response.'' In one week last month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, marshals evicted 257 people from residences where suspected drug activity occurred. Some of the most intense efforts have been in drug-infested public housing. Housing and Urban Development officials have issued waivers to public housing agencies in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, allowing them to streamline the eviction process by up to nine months. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has vowed to ensure due process, but some worry that people will be harmed, especially parents unable to control drug-dealing children. `` If it happened to a middle-class person in their own house, they would not lose their abode,'' said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. `` It's picking on the most vulnerable people in society and creating a whole new group of homeless.'' Sometimes, she said, people not even suspected of wrongdoing are hurt. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is representing a woman and her children in <LOCATION> Peekskill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, ordered out when their building was seized as a suspected drug den. But those directing the raids insist there is local support. `` The people want it,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman. `` I have received requests for sweeps from every development in the city.'' And <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> agrees: `` The strongest pressure I'm getting to clamp down harder is coming from the residents of public housing. If it were up to them, they'd have public executions in the courtyard.'' <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> has evicted 18 families from public and private housing after two controlled drug buys from each residence, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want to take any risk of evicting an innocent person,'' he said. `` We do n't want to ruin it for the rest of the country.'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said the city is compiling a public file of Social Security numbers of people evicted in drug cases, and landlords can then deny them housing. Still, the impact is limited, he and others concede. `` It nowhere near begins to really address the major problems of drugs,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> and Redevelopment Officials. `` That requires a lot more than pure enforcement pressure.'' A similar criticism was made of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for a juvenile curfew aimed at curbing drug-related violence. It was rejected in May by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>, who called it a `` bull in a china shop of constitutional values.'' Other crackdown efforts, such as prosecuting pregnant drug abusers, Have been denounced as senseless and damaging to those needing help. `` They're creating out of thin air a new crime _ the mother's failure to provide the perfect womb,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paltrow </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s Reproductive Freedom Project `` The biggest effect of all this attention is to have a pregnant woman currently using any type of drug to shy away from going to a hospital and delivering,'' said <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, attorney <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamore </PERSON>, who represented a woman convicted of pre-natal child abuse for using cocaine up to a few hours before birth. But prosecutor <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> responds: `` It may be something that drives them underground or it may be the last straw that convinces them to do something about their own problem.'' Similar cases are emerging elsewhere. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a woman who allegedly took cocaine during pregnancy is charged with child abuse and distributing drugs. In a different type of get-tough program, criminal court judges in two <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> counties have begun asking people convicted of possessing or selling drugs to name their supplier. Refusal could earn a contempt charge. The progam is modeled after one in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, Neb. This aggressive approach follows other controversial measures, including widespread drug testing in industry and government, and forefeiture laws in many places allowing property, such as cars and boats, to be seized from people accused but not convicted of drug offenses. A survey of more than 1,000 corporate members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> found that in 1988, 48 percent of companies tested for drugs, compared with 21 percent in 1986. While all of these steps have come under attack, even critics understand the motive. Constituents clamor for politicians `` to solve the drug problem,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> legal director in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But he cautions against quick fixes. `` It's a problem that's been a long time in coming,'' he said, `` and it will be a long time in going away.

<HEAD>With the House At Stake, Computers and Lawyers Are Ready for Redistricting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Armed with batteries of computers and brigades of lawyers, Republicans and Democrats are skirmishing for control of the political shakeup that offers the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> its once-in-a-decade opportunity to dent Democratic control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we want to be competitive in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, we have to get a good shake on redistricting,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, the political consultant who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s advisory committee on redistricting `` Right now, given the strength of incumbency, there are only two times you get a chance to pick up any congressional seats,'' he said. `` One is when the seats are open, and two is when you redraw the lines.'' For Republicans, redistricting is a chance to break out of their depressing status as a seemingly permanent minority in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by a margin of 260 to 175. While voters in recent presidential elections have preferred Republican candidates by landslide margins, Democrats now hold 18 more <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats than they did when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was inaugurated in 1981. Democrats claim the capital's political split personality comes from voters' desire to have <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> act as a balance to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidents. Republicans claim the split is rooted the Democrats' drawing the lines for most current congressional districts Redistricting is the once-a-decade reshuffling of the nation's congressional districts It is a three-pronged battle _ technical, political, and legal. Every 10 years, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Census counts everyone living in the country. This time, the day for the count is April 1, 1990. For politicians, the most important Census information is not how many Americans there are, but where they live. For while the population increases, the size of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> remains at 435 voting members. By Dec. 31, 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> will announce each state's population And the bureau will reveal the reapportionment of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ the number of representatives for each state, based on a complicated mathematical formula. Then comes redistricting at the state level _ redrawing the boundaries of congressional districts to fit the new population. Gone are the days when cigar-chomping politicians matched up Census data with voting lists and redrew lines to help their friends and punish their enemies. They're still helping their friends and punishing their enemies, but now the politicians do it with computers that produce highly sophisticated plans to can do in a legislator with subtle shifts of city blocks. But computers have little value to politicians who do n't have the votes to get their plan adopted. The two parties are considered on a par technologically, but the Democrats control 28 state legislatures, while Republicans have only 8. In 13 states Republicans control one legislative chamber and Democrats the other. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> has a unicameral nonpartisan legislature. The other key players are governors _ 28 are Democrats, while 22 are Republicans. Elections this year and next will determine who controls redistricting. In the states expected to gain or lose the most seats, neither party is in control, promising fierce battles for governor and legislative seats. The 1990 Census will certify the shift to the Sunbelt that will have <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> speaking with a decidedly more Southern and Western accent. Based on current estimates, 17 House seats will head South and West. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will be the big winner, gaining six seats with an outside chance of picking up seven. With 45 members in the current <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> already has by far the largest congressional delegation. Other winners are <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, expected to gain four <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, likely to pick up three. Likely to gain one each are <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The losers are a familiar lineup _ mostly Northern industrial states that have seen their congressional representation erode in recent decades. If current trends hold, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will lose three seats and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and Illinois two each. Losing one each would be <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. With redistricting clout in the balance, the high-profile races for governor are in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ all of which are now in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hands. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are not running for re-election and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is regarded as vulnerable. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> has n't announced yet whether he will seek a fifth term as governor. In addition, the battle for control will be fought in countless legislative contests. For example, in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, Democrats would control the process if they capture the state <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> where Republicans have a narrow majority. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, Republicans control one chamber by four seats and Democrats the other by three. After the politicians draw the district lines, the battle will move to another arena, the courts. At some point in the 1980 process, redistricting plans in all but three states ended up in court, says <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> <PERSON> Brace </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm that works on redistricting for Democrats. Thus Republicans and Democrats are recruiting teams of lawyers to defend their plans or attack the opposition's in federal and state courts. The guiding legal principle stems from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s `` one man, one vote'' ruling that mandated that legislative districts be substantially equal in population. Brace cited a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> plan that ended up in court. Republicans offered a plan with congressional districts differing in population by no more than four people. But the court ruled in favor of the Democrats' plan which was drawn with each district identical in population. How long do districts remain identical in population? Probably not more than a day or two after the Census is taken.

 People are born, people die, people move. Those 18 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> districts started out with a population of 514,560 each in 1980. As of July 1, 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the population of the 13th Congressional District in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> had declined to 444,600. The Fifth District, which includes Grand Rapids, had grown to 552,000. Population is n't the only criteria. In states with a history of racial bias, redistricting plans must be cleared by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to assure they do n't discriminate against minorities. Whatever the process, cries of `` gerrymander'' are certain to be heard across the land from politicians who did n't have the votes to get their own redistricting plan approved. The term comes from <LOCATION> Massachusets </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Elbridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON>, who is better remembered for the redistricting bill he signed in 1811 than for the fact that he also signed the Declaration of Independence. The redistricting bill, designed to help Democrats and weaken Federalists, created a salamander-shaped district that was immediately dubbed a `` gerrymander.'' But the general rule is: better to be accused of gerrymandering than to be gerrymandered. Republicans cried gerrymander frequently in the early 1980s, pointing often at the most notorious recent example of the genre _ the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plan attributed to the late Rep. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>. It redrew congressional lines in a manner that Republicans claimed cost them five seats. At the time, the governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was a Democrat and the party controlled both chambers of the legislature. The Republicans were nothing more than injured bystanders who appealed unsuccessfully to the courts for redress. While Republicans cry foul about <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> redistricting, Democrat <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> says the first partisan shot came from the GOP. `` The Republicans of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> began the redistricting year gloriously by using their political strength to eliminate one Democratic congressman and endanger others,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, then political director of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` And the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spent the rest of the year complaining that Democratic majorities were trying to act in a partisan fashion.'' Republicans entered 1981 with high hopes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had just taken office and dreams of a historic political realignment were dancing in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> heads. The 1980 Census had found a major shift of population from traditionally Democratic industrial states to the more conservative Sunbelt. Banks of computers were set up at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as party leaders predicted technology would provide a substantial advantage. But in state after state, the Democratic politicians outwitted the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s computers. `` They had three computers, $ 4 million and a staff of 40,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` I had two typewriters, one and a half staff people and no budget allocation at all ... `` But I had more friends than they did. I had more legislators than they did and ultimately we were able to produce more votes than they did.'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a Republican consultant and former <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> political director, still gnashes his teeth when reminded of the 1981 redistricting. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> thought it had a technical edge and talked about it a lot and it flopped,'' he said. Redistricting can be an unsettling experience for politicians who normally are among the nation's most secure elected officials. Most congressmen, while on the ballot every two years, have what amount to ten-year terms. For example, 99 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who sought another term in 1988 were re-elected. Listen to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofeller </PERSON>, redistricting expert for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee: `` You're not really a veteran in redistricting until you've sat down at a strategy session during the middle of the process and said, ` We know we're safe here. They ca n't possibly screw us here.' And had the <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> truck come and run right over you.''

<TEXT>
 When <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters elect a new governor in 1990, they will shape the make-up of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for the rest of this century as well as the course of the 1992 presidential race. It's no wonder that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> has declared that his `` main objective for 1990 is electing Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' `` We're prepared to fight them tooth and toenail,'' said Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Rarely has a single state election had the potential national impact of the contest to succeed Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who opted against seeking a third term as governor. The numbers tell part of the story. Already the nation's most populous state, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> now has 45 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and is expected to gain six or seven more after the 1990 Census confirms the continuing shift of the nation's population to the Sunbelt That means <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will have 53 or 54 of the 270 electoral votes needed to elect a president in 1992. In addition, it is likely that the state will assert its influence on presidential nominating politics by moving its presidential primary to early March. The initial advantage in the high-stakes governor's race went to the Republicans when they convinced <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to run for governor, taking on another multi-million-dollar race just after he won a second Senate term in 1988. On the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> side, party leaders would like _ without much realistic hope _ to avoid a bitter gubernatorial primary between state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is a major source of campaign contributions for politicians from all regions of the country, but even its political largess could be strained in 1992 if <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is elected governor. If that happens, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s appointed successor in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have to run in 1992 for the final two years of the term. And the seat now held by Democrat Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> is up in 1992 as well. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> fund-raisers shudder at the prospect of two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races during a presidential year in which the state also will have six new House seats. The big losers could be the large group of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators elected in 1986, when the party regained control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Many of those Democrats would like to raise thousands of dollars in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` It's certainly going to make us much more introspective,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, a major <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We're all going to be focusing on ourselves. We will not be as available to others.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>, an entertainment industry executive who also is an active <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund raiser, said the burst of activity would probably have little impact on Californians who regularly give $ 25,000 a year to political candidates. `` I keep answering this question, yes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> businessman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> when asked if money could grow tighter for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates. `` Yet we keep finding new donors.'' While the impact of the governors race on fund-raising is debatable, there's no question of the redistricting stakes. In 1981, when new district lines were drawn to conform to the 1980 Census, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gained two new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats. The Democrats controlled the legislature and the governor was <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, also a Democrat. The Republicans were on the sidelines as the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> rammed through a plan _ authored largely by the late Rep. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> _ that was credited with enabling his party to win five seats in the 1982 elections. With <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> picking up six or seven seats this time, the stakes will be even higher. The Democrats still control the legislature, but unless they can upset <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, they'll have to reach a compromise with the governor. `` If we win the governor's race _ and I think it's very doable,'' said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, `` then we have the legislature and the governor and we go ahead and have a very smooth reapportionment from our point of view.'' The congressman predicted that a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor would balk at any compromise with the legislature. Then the issue would be decided by the courts, where many of the judges were appointed by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` They would do basically a Republican plan,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said of the courts. Should the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> come out way ahead in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and also pick up seats in states like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ which also have <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors _ <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said it would `` have an impact on national legislation.'' `` Say we lose ten Democrats. You could have an impact on every bill we got through in the 87-88 year because we barely got a lot of them through,'' said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> who was the chief <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vote-counter in the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was among five anti-apartheid candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s governing board awaiting word on whether alumni supported their stand against the school's investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It has been a vituperative campaign.

The group, which has three members on the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseers </ORGANIZATION>, ran five candidates against a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> Association-backed slate of 10, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON>.

 Initial buyout offers for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have been rejected and suitors for the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> have been given until June 16 to enhance their proposals. `` None of the proposals is sufficiently more attractive than the others,'' a five-member review committee set up by <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors said Monday in a letter to bidders. The letter said each of the bids is `` subject to unacceptable material conditions.'' It directed interested buyers to address regulatory concerns and asked for revised bids to propose compensation for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> in the event it accepts an offer that later collapses. `` Bidders should specifically address their ability to consummate a transaction in light of financing and other conditions,'' the letter said. The committee's letter also repeated a statement that `` there can be no assurance that a sale of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> or any other transaction will result from <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s review of alternatives.'' <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock tumbled $ 1.87 -LCB- to close at $ 106.87 -LCB- a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier made a proposal valued at $ 3.3 billion, was the only announced bidder to say immediately it would submit a revised bid, but the company did not reveal details. Other known bidders are billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, whose $ 2.7 billion offer earlier this year started the bidding process; <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor who heads a group that includes <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the Australian holding company <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 20,000-member Machinists' union. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellhuner </PERSON> said today that the Dutch state airliner was not surprised by the move and is studying its options. He said there is a `` good possibility'' the <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> group will `` get in touch again with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> would not comment on the rejection. A spokesman for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the oil mogul would study the committee's letter `` and for now will withhold any reaction to it.'' <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an aviation consulting firm in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s move could be designed to broaden the scope of bidders for the nation's fourth-largest airline. Suitors who were told the bidding would be conducted in a single round could by angered by such a development, she said. Among those rumored as a possible suitor is the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> takeover firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which could now step in and make a bid if it missed the initial deadline, <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman has declined to say whether the company is a bidder. The company continued its silence Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has informed <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> his department would review any proposed leveraged buyout of the airline to judge the financial fitness of the proposed new owner. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s review committee will meet with department officials to discuss <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s concerns, the company said Monday. The committee said in its letter that suitors are welcome to meet with <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> management to seek more information about the airline, based in the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, but the letter stressed that the meetings would not include negotiations. `` You should be aware that no aspect of any of the proposals has been disclosed to members of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> management,'' the letter said. The quote prompted rumors that <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> management, led by Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>, was assembling its own buyout proposal, said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>.

 Both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House are expressing outrage at the violence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but U.S.-China farm trade appears to be continuing as usual. `` I do n't believe in using food as a weapon,'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday `` With all that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people are suffering, we should not deprive them of food as well. `` However, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government must not use our food as a weapon against its own people. I know the world community would object to any attempt of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government to restrict the flow of food to its people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought another 1.8 million metric tons of soft red winter wheat from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers, according to exporters. That makes 2.65 million metric tons of the commodity bought for delivery in the marketing year that began June 1. A metric ton is equal to about 2,205 pounds and 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn. Most of the Chinese purchases were in the last two weeks, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. During the marketing year that ended May 31, exporters sold 8.3 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also buys poultry to breed, livestock semen, hogs and seed to plant for animal feed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign agricultural service By far, the largest commodity is grain, said a spokeswoman in the department. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> gets other products from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, she said. Since former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s grain embargo against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the December 1979 invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the federal government has opposed using agricultural products as foreign policy weapons against countries. But that does n't mean it wo n't refuse to extend the Export Enhancement Program to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The first 300,000 metric tons of wheat purchased this year by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were under that discount program, but all the rest has been bought at market prices. `` We must be absolutely clear that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s brutality against its own people is unacceptable,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the agriculture committee `` At the same time, it's important that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions be moderate and targeted against the government rather than the people of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday that weapons sales would be suspended and `` other aspects of bilateral relationship'' would be reviewed. `` On the commercial side, I do n't want to hurt the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during a news conference. `` I happen to believe that commercial contacts have led, in essence, to this quest for more freedom.'' Rep. <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be committed never to use food embargoes as a weapon because they `` are ineffective and hurt both sides.'' `` Food embargoes are never the answer, and particularly in this case it could worsen the pain and suffering of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' he said.

 Oats and oat products can be sold to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> without import licenses because the level of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government subsidies for oats is less than <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s, the two countries have announced. The governments announced Monday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support level for oats is 8.74 percent, while in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> it is 11.09 percent. Under the free trade agreement signed between the two countries last year, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> agreed to remove import licensing requirements if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support levels are equal to or less than those of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Supports are government subsidies that put a floor under prices. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mechanism for doing this is a price-support loan program under which farmers use crops as collateral and are free to forfeit and keep the money if that nets them a greater return than selling on the market. Import licenses will be required for wheat and barley. The support comparisons for those commodities are wheat, 61.62 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 46.28 percent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; barley, 72.49 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 50.23 percent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> may announce this week where it plans to move its <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, and some employees say the company's actions suggest it has picked a site out of state, a newspaper reported today. The retail giant last week created a task force to help group employees relocate and another to help their spouses find new jobs, leading many to speculate <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> had decided to move out of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, a source in the company told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. But the paper, which did not identify the source, said a company memo circulated last week denied that the creation of the task forces implied a move out of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The Merchandise Group employs 6,000 people. Sources told both the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Sun-Times that it appeared a decision on where to move the group would be announced this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> had decided against moving the group to suburban <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION>, but had not ruled out a site near <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations increased their oil production to 21 million barrels a day in May, the highest output so far this year, according to estimates released today. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also predicted in its Monthly Oil Market Report that demand for the cartel's oil would rise in the second half of the year to about 20.85 million barrels a day, up from a previous estimate of 20.4 million barrels. The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to set new price and production guidelines for the rest of the year. The ministers opened their formal strategy meeting Monday, then adjourned to hold private bargaining sessions. Estimates of demand for their crude were heavily influencing discussions. Today, <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>, oil minister of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, a persistent overproducer in the cartel, said he would like to see <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> boost its daily production to between 20 million and 21 million barrels from the current 18.5 million barrels. <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> refused to say how much he'd like of the extra output. The primary issue in the talks, he said, `` is to get everybody within the new umbrella of 20 or 20 plus -LRB- million barrels a day -RRB- as a new ceiling.'' `` There's definitely movement toward an agreement,'' said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil chief, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON>, but he did not elaborate No date was set for resumption of their formal talks. Anticipating more demand for their crude, the ministers seemed intent on fixing a higher output ceiling _ of as much as 20 million barrels a day _ for the second half of the year. The ministers also appeared to be leaning toward retaining their benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has recommended discontinuing the target price. The sticking point in their bargaining is how to divide up the extra output among the 13 countries. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> want a bigger share of any increase. The energy agency's report said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production in May rose about 500,000 barrels from April. `` This was primarily the result of higher production in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, partly offset by a small decline in Iranian and Ecuadorian production,'' it said. Oil futures prices recently have been rising amid speculation about the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting. Other developments also helped drive up energy prices Monday, including the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the Soviet gas pipeline explosion and turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 38 cents to $ 20.52 a barrel Monday. Prices of refined products also rose.

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Lower Despite Sales to China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> despite increased sales of wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Monday's announcement that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has purchased 1.85 million metric tons of wheat sent wheat prices higher in early trading today, but prices moved lower as trading progressed. The wheat sale apparently had been negotiated over the previous two weeks, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Despite the announcement of the sale, analysts say there is concern the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could disrupt industry and commerce in that huge commodity-trading nation. Corn prices were higher despite word that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have made major corn purchases from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> instead of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Soybean prices were mostly higher, although the strong dollar is expected to continue to hamper export sales. At the open, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.94 a bushel; corn was a \ cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with July at $ 2.64 -LCB- a bushel; oats were a -LCB- cent lower with July at $ 1.68 -LCB- a bushel and soybeans were -RCB- cent lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.09 a bushel. Livestock and meat prices were lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .15 cent to .55 cent lower with June at 68.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August at 79.20 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .30 cent lower with June at 48.45 cents a pound; pork bellies were .30 cent to 1 cent lower with July at 31.55 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is asking his colleagues to scrap President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s child care tax credit proposal in favor of a plan that would help parents pay for their children's day care and health insurance. In a memo sent to committee members Monday and obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, proposed making the current dependent care tax credit that is available to low - and moderate-income families refundable in advance A new credit _ up to $ 500 a year _ would be created to help pay for health insurance for children under age 19. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the proposal would cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> $ 11.6 billion over the next five fiscal years. He said the loss could be offset by added revenue the government will reap when tax credits now extended to troubled financial institutions expire next year and by making permanent the 3 percent federal telephone excise tax. The phone tax is scheduled to drop to 2 percent on Jan. 1, 1990. In the memo, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> asked committee members to vote on the plan Wednesday. However, because of other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> business he postponed that action until next week and called off a planned news conference at which he was to outline the legislation. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s `` children's initiative'' would replace the $ 2.5 billion tax-credit plan offered by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but is not intended to undermine a separate child-care bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wanted his tax-credit package to be passed in conjunction with the final version of <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s bill The Dodd bill would provide federal funds for more child care slots and set minimum federal standards for day care centers. Most Republicans vigorously oppose the regulatory provisions of the Dodd measure and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides said they believed <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wanted to keep his measure as separate legislation to improve its chances of passage unless a bipartisan agreement is reached on an overall child-care package _ the subject of current negotiations. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in the memo, said making the existing dependent care credit refundable would provide cash for poor families who owe no taxes, and who therefore would not benefit from a normal credit against tax liability. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his child-care bill, also suggested making the existing Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable. The president also proposed a new tax credit of up to $ 1,000 a child, initially for families with incomes of between $ 8,000 and $ 13,000, with the credit phasing in and by 1994 becoming available to familes with incomes of up to $ 20,000. In outlining that proposal to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee last month, Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> took a swipe at <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s plan. `` The child care needs of working Americans can best be met by providing assistance to parents, not to providers; through state and local regulations, not federal standards; through community-based and public-private partnerships, not federal bureaucracies; and by parental involvement, not federally mandated procedures.'' Critics of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan, while applauding the president's motives, have said that creating a new credit and making parents choose between it and the existing credit would only confuse parents and perhaps cause them to avail themselves of neither Indeed, a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tax expert at the hearing with Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had trouble explaining the mechanics of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal to the committee. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made no mention of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal in his memo but aides said he believed broader application of the existing credit was a better approach than creating a duplicative approach. The new health insurance credit proposed by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would allow families with incomes of $ 12,000 or less to receive a tax credit for up to 50 percent of the cost of insurance premiums for a child under the age of 19. The maximum credit would be $ 500. Families with incomes between $ 12,000 and $ 21,000 would be eligible for a reduced credit, with the exact amount to be determined by income. The health insurance credit, which would become effective in 1991, could be paid out in advance if the taxpayer desired the money up front. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also proposed allocating $ 25 million a year for the next five years, through the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, for a program under which the federal government would pay up to 50 percent of the costs of programs to provide basic health care to uninsured children under age 19 and their families.

<HEAD>EEC Reopens Anti-Dumping Process On U.S. Propane Product</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will consider whether to continue anti-dumping measures against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of propylene alcohol, a propane-derived product used in making printing ink, paints and cosmetics. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers of propylene alcohol are <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which is part of <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. Current anti-dumping measures against imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> propylene alcohol were first decided in April 1984. They were due to expire last year, but will be kept in force until the new investigation is completed, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Democrats and Republicans bickered today over whether to repeal a tax law that businesses find burdensome, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> struggled to complete a wide-ranging, $ 3.3 billion spending bill. As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began its third day of debate on the legislation, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., offered an amendment repealing a section of the 1986 tax-revision law that he said has `` wreaked havoc'' on companies because of its complexity and costs Democrats countered with a provision that conceded the tax requirement is `` onerous'' and urged its reworking by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later in the year. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> more than two months ago to provide extra money for this year for several federal agencies. Since then, the measure has grown not only in size but in breadth, attracting an assortment of amendments ranging from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to work on an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> lake. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>'s amendment revokes a requirement that businesses satisfy a complex test to prove that their health insurance plans are not more generous to upper echelon employees than they are to low-paid workers. Companies have complained that the provision, which took effect this year, has created mounds of paperwork. Small businesses in particular have been unhappy. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> called the problem `` the No. 1 domestic issue in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today'' in a written statement last week, and his amendment was co-sponsored by at least 13 other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., have said the requirement needs to be reworked Another amendment, to be offered by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., temporarily postpones the surtax now imposed on elderly Americans as the price for new <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> coverage of catastrophic care Senior citizens have complained about the expense, which will cost a maximum of $ 850 in 1989 for the wealthiest Americans over age 65. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially requested the legislation in March, seeking $ 2.2 billion for veterans, college students, forest fire costs and other needs. By the time the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill last month, it had grown to $ 3.7 billion, slightly surpassing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s version. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the legislation has garnered a slew of amendments that range from the global to the parochial. A provision added last week directs the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 500,000 this year on a project in <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The measure was sponsored by the state's two Democratic senators, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. The bill also picked up language sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., expressing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s disinclination to approve a <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> administrator named by Panamanian ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> By law, the chief of government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can nominate a new chief for the agency in January. That choice must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> served notice it would not go along with the Panamanian strongman. The 1989 federal fiscal year runs through Sept. 30.

 Share prices rallied Tuesday to close significantly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, breaking a five-day string of losses. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 18.9 points, or 0.9 percent, to finish at 2,107.4, its best level of the day. At its lowest, the index was down 10.9 points in early trading. The market opened lower on the back of Wall Street's fall Monday and on continued worries about British interest rates and violence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A bit of strength in the pound around midday, combined with some bargain hunting and expectations of a higher opening on Wall Street, started the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market moving higher. The rally gathered strength as Wall Street opened for business, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average up about 20 points when trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> came to a close. The rally was driven in part by technical factors, as a short supply of stock accentuated the effects of a small amount of institutional buying, dealers said. Volume rose to a moderate 445.8 million shares from Monday's 359.2 million shares

 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it sold five of its European businesses to <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> food and beverage company, for $ 2.5 billion in an effort to reduce some of its debt from a record buyout. <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION> bought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> biscuit business of <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>; British snack food makers <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Crisps and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s Crisps; The <ORGANIZATION> Belin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a French biscuit and pastry business; and <PERSON> Saiwa </PERSON>, a biscuit and snack producer in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> The five European companies had pretax profit of $ 137 million on sales of $ 1.2 billion in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> put the European units on the block last month, saying the sales would be part of an effort to reduce the company's overall debt by about $ 5.5 billion In the wake of its $ 24.5 billion takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, completed earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> has annual interest payments of about $ 3 billion. The company has been expected to sell several assets in an attempt to reduce that debt. <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who follows <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION> deal demonstrates that there should be eager customers for any <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> units made available. `` This indicates that, indeed, the RJR properties are hot properties,'' he said. `` It is one thing to project that, and another to actually see it.'' <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> are ranked one and two, respectively, in the biscuit and snack food business in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> said, and the deal reinforces <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION>'s powerhouse status at home. <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION> did not have a major presence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, though <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> did, <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> added. `` All of a sudden, they -LRB- BSN -RRB- are a big player in the British snack market,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION> markets a variety of biscuit, dairy and grocery products, as well as beer, champagne and mineral water. `` BSN has acquired five attractive food businesses, each possessing strong brands, distribution and sales systems, manufacturing facilities and management,'' <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` As part of <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s premier food and beverage companies, these businesses should continue to develop and prosper,'' he said. <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> said the sale, while helping <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> reduce its debt, will not diminish the company's competitive standing. `` The size and strength of our food businesses in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> continue to place <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> among the world's leading cookie, cracker and snack producers,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest oil exporter, has made a new oil find in the <LOCATION> Khurais </LOCATION> region southeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, oil industry executives said Tuesday. Officials at the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aramco </LOCATION> oil company, reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, confirmed the report but refused to give details about its potential. The company is based in the kingdom's Gulf city of <LOCATION> Dhahran </LOCATION>. The new find results from a large-scale high-technology exploration program launched by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aramco </LOCATION> in 1986, the company officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. As part of the program, <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> drilled a new wildcat well in the <LOCATION> Khurais </LOCATION> region 125 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. The drillers hit a small amount of oil in a reservoir and had some gas shows. First reports suggested that oil discovered in that region was not in commercial amounts, but <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aramco </LOCATION> was optimistic about the gas. Sources close to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aramco </LOCATION> say the gas discovery was sizeable and commercially viable, but the company officials declined to confirm or deny the report. Saudi Aramco announced this year its proven oil reserves have risen to 252 billion barrels from 169 billion barrels. Its annual report for 1988 speculated that remaining reserves could be as high as 315 billion barrels. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has the world's largest known oil reserves. Almost all are in areas managed by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aramco </LOCATION>, which has discovered 52 oil fields and one commercial gas field in 55 years of exploration.

 <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday its second-quarter profit rose 18 percent, as strong results in entertainment and financial services more than offset seasonally weak results from educational publishing. On a separate matter, the company declined comment on a published report in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today that Paramount was weighing making a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is already in an agreement to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> was up 37 -LCB- cents a share at $ 33.37 -LCB- at midday while Time was up $ 2.75 a share at $ 126. In its earnings report, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 65.6 million, or 55 cents a share, in the three months ended April 30 compared with $ 55.5 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. The 1988 earnings results included a net gain of $ 4.8 million from the sale of the company's 30 percent interest in a videocassette duplication business. Second-quarter revenue rose 12.7 percent to $ 699 million from $ 620 million a year earlier. The revenue figures exclude results from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, the consumer and commercial finance business that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> put up for sale in April. For the first six months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 134.8 million, or $ 1.13 a share, up 12 percent from $ 120.2 million, or $ 1 a share, a year earlier. Six-month revenue, excluding <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, rose 10.5 percent to $ 1.47 billion from $ 1.33 billion a year earlier. Paramount did not break out its quarterly and six-month revenue figures for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects oprating income from entertainment and publishing this year would approximate the $ 432 million reported 1988. He said 1989 earnings including results from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> to the date of its sale would exceed the 1988 total of $ 384.7 million. In the second quarter, he said income from continuing operations included record contributions from the entertainment business, due to sharp increases in <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>' operations and gains by its Madison Square Garden unit. The entertainment results included the success of the movie `` The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad'' and the syndication of television show `` Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and strong sales to pay cable services. Madison Square Garden operations benefitted from higher attendance at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knickerbocker </ORGANIZATION> basketball games, <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> league expansion revenues and increased ticket sales at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> hockey games which more than offset a decline at the <ORGANIZATION> MSG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a cable service that had higher costs associated with the startup of its <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> cablecasts this spring. Publishing results reflected seasonal losses in educational operations, which traditionally have their highest sales in the second half of the year.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employers must train workers more and better and reward enhanced skills to remain competitive internationally, according to a study released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can educate and train employees outside the workplace until it is blue in the face, but if employers do not design institutions and jobs that use and reward learning, all efforts will make little difference,'' the report said. The study was released at the annual meeting here of the 45-year-old <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, Va.-based society, which represents nearly 50,000 professionals involved in employer-based training. The group includes managers, administrators, educators and researchers who devise in-house training. Their work ranges from teaching illiterate workers to read, to improving sales and customer service skills, to educating executives in running a company. `` Analysis of the available data and case studies of individual employers leads to the conclusion that employers' current commitments to training and development are probably insufficient,'' the report said. It said that while learning in the workplace can boost individual opportunity and corporate competitiveness, `` learning has a relatively low standing and low frequency in the American workplace.'' Citing federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> data, the report said 11 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers receive formal training and 14 percent get informal on-the-job training to prepare for jobs. By the year 2000, the report said, 65 percent of all jobs will require some training or education beyond high school, compared with 54 per cent now. The report recommended that: _ Employers set short-term targets of spending 2 percent of payroll on formal training and increasing the proportion of workers tapped for extra training to nearly 15 percent, from 10 percent now The long-term goal should be 4 percent of payroll costs to train 30 percent of employees. _ The government create tax incentives to induce employers to improve the quality of worker training _ Employers and educators join to raise the level of workplace training and education _ Firms establish workplace incentives for advanced training through performance-based selection, appraisal and rewards The study was the second in a month to warn that weak job training was hurting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productivity. A two-year <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> study called `` Made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' concluded that national proseprity was undermined by industrial weakness. It recommended that companies offer workers more on-the-job training and learning opportunities to improve productivity.

 <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> became the latest big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company to pull expatriate workers from strife-racked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today, chartering a plane to withdraw its 51 people from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and two other cities. The move by the division of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a partner in a joint-venture aircraft assembly plant outside <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, was an about-face from the company's position a day earlier when it said business was normal. The company also became one of the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses to charter a plane for evacuations and one of the first with big operations outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to withdraw. Up to now most of the evacuees have been from the capital, which has been in turmoil since the weekend when troops killed hundreds of civilians. `` We've changed our situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. We decided last night to begin pulling our people out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The situation apparently has changed overnight.'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said the company's 43 people based just outside <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, seven people based in the southwest city of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> and one representative in the northeast industrial center of <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION> would leave as soon as possible. Many other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses that had reacted cautiously toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political crisis also have been withdrawing workers from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and a growing number are becoming gloomy about the longer-term impact to their investments. `` Now with this random shooting in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> it's no longer fun. Anyone who approaches a window risks his life,'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an international lawyer who helped pioneer the American business presence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` With respect to our own staff, I think it is time to withdraw for a while,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, whose firm of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> has offices in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Until this weekend I thought that was unwarranted. But now we have to think of people's safety. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, was heavily booked on its 400-seat flight out of the capital today, spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> said. By early this afternoon the airline had not added any flights, although there were reports the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was trying to charter planes to help evacuate American nationals. Ms. <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> was continuing to deliberately delay the Tokyo-Beijing leg of its regular U.S.-to-Beijing flight by 15 hours to avoid an overnight layover in the capital, fearing the airport might close. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said earlier that the airline's <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo-Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> flight also was delayed to minimize ground time in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, `` just because the situation is so fluid there.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a senior executive of the international law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mckenzie </PERSON>, said his China-based staffers had left for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> because of the concern for personal safety, and `` clients are dealing with the situation there the same as we are.'' `` The implications of this are profound,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I do n't see how anyone doing business there could n't set those plans in a state of suspension. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business reaction to the chaos in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is particularly important because American investment is one of the biggest influences on the country's effort to modernize. More than 600 U.S.-Chinese joint ventures have been signed since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> normalized relations 10 years ago, with American investment there totaling at least $ 3.5 billion. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s biggest trading partners. `` A political uncertainty and a standoff is one thing. A massacre is another,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based organization of American companies. `` Everybody's going to have to factor that in.'' <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were among companies that said they had evacuated people because of the violence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the growing uncertainty elsewhere in the country.

 <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors today approved a $ 1.6 billion buyout offer made by a corporation including <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> management, ending a two-month hostile takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. The corporation was formed by <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> and includes <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based securities firm, and the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it was terminating its bid because of the deal and said it would decide whether to sell some or all of its <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> shares. The agreement calls for acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> and a management group led by company chairman and chief executive officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmiege </PERSON> for $ 45.50 per share in cash, and $ 4.50 per share of pay-in-kind preferred stock with a 17 percent dividend rate. <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>, a private <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking firm, will hold a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> under the agreement. The transaction, valued at $ 1.6 billion, is based upon approximately 19 million <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding and the assumption of <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> debt. The offer was approved by a special <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> board committee that was evaluating bids for the Chicago-based rail company. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that operates in nine states, most of them in the Midwest. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder with an 8.8 percent stake, has been attempting a takeover since April 27. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>'s $ 44-a-share offer values <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> at $ 722 million New York-based <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> is headed by two former <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> investment bankers, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazarian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> officials did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Pa.-based <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> relies heavily on the North Western's Chicago-to-Fremont, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, line for east-west freight traffic. The Union Pacific accounts for about 40 percent of the North Western's shipments, analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> recently paid $ 1.5 million for an option to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, a regional line between <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Officials said the line would have served as a substitute to the North Western should a hostile takeover disrupt freight service. Officials of <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> had said they planned to sell <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s real estate, excess equipment and Chicago-area commuter lines if their takeover bid was successful. The railroad's union on Friday made a proposal to buy the company that would have given employees a one-third stake in the railroad.

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Drop Despite China Deal</HEAD>

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with wheat prices falling despite announcement of a major sale to the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Monday's announcement that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> purchased 1.85 million metric tons of wheat was expected to be a boost to prices, but that did n't happen `` The sale was already factored into the market so there was some liquidation,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> noted that there was also some commercial selling of wheat futures because of a lack of business. `` There is so much uncertainty in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, people are n't willing to pay $ 4 a bushel for wheat, which what it was getting to,'' he said. Corn prices dropped in a spillover from the sale of wheat futures, despite word from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that recent severe weather in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> could prevent planting of about 50 percent of that state's planned corn crop. Soybean prices fell as investors purchased old crop futures and sold new crop. Analysts say the strong dollar is expected to continue to hamper export sales. At the close, wheat was -RCB- cent to 3 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.92 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with July at $ 2.63 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 1.65 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.07 a bushel

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> union leaders told striking workers Tuesday to remain optimistic about a possible buyout, but the troubled carrier said the prospects of a deal were dead. A federal bankruptcy judge Monday said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> should begin negotiating on plans to reorganize as a smaller carrier after an investor group led by the unions and a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman failed to put together a takeover deal. `` The fat lady just sang,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said. `` I can tell you it's absolutely untrue,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> local, told members at the union hall who gathered to discuss apparent bad news in their three-month-old strike. `` So let's hang in there.'' Eastern said the ruling by Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> ended buyout possibilities by <PERSON> Chiacgo </PERSON> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and the unions, who nonetheless maintained it was alive. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, the attorney for the committee representing major creditors, said in court the proposal was `` interesting and constructive'' but would n't be possible without <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> approval. The group met Saturday with representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> but failed to win support for the buyout plan, which included a $ 100 million equity investment and $ 210 million in union wage concessions. The judge directed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to begin talks with creditors over the company's plan to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and reorganize in bankruptcy court as a smaller carrier. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> group could continue discussing its offer with creditors, but that the court no longer would consider it unless it was acceptable to Eastern. `` It's always there in the minds of some who would like to keep it alive,'' Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said, but added: `` There are no buyers out there.'' But pilots union spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> countered that <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> did not kill the <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> bid or give approval to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s awaited reorganization plan. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the unions believe the creditors will reject the rebuilding plan, which focuses on mass asset sales the union says would leave Eastern too crippled to compete. The unions also contend that management wo n't be able to hire enough qualified pilots and mechanics. `` We do n't think Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is going to find enough professional people to put his airline back without the unions,'' said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, a Machinists general chairman. `` He's got people out there, but they're round pegs for square holes.'' The pilots union urged its members not to `` make any rash decisions'' based on what the union called inaccurate information from news reports about <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>'s ruling. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> set a meeting for Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between his group and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the court-appointed examiner for Eastern. `` I thought the unions were grasping at straws,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst. `` I think it's pretty much dead now. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9, five days after pilots and flight attendants joined striking ground workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union in a walkout that virtually grounded the airline. Under bankruptcy law, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has the exclusive right until early July to submit a reorganization plan. Eastern's lead attorney, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> probably would propose its plan within two to three weeks. Eastern already has discussed an outline of a reorganization scheme with the creditors' committee, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has won its biggest contract ever, a five-year, $ 150 million deal to provide <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with a worldwide network for voice and data communications, the companies said Tuesday. The deal is the latest in a series of such links, as big phone customers turn over the construction of state-of-the-art international networks to the big phone companies. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said last week it had selected <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> to build the first phase of its international network. The value of that deal was not disclosed. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to reduce its costs by more than $ 100 million over the five-year period. `` After an intensive review of our communications strategy and future needs, we chose <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> because of its ability to meet the technical and management demands of our business environment, the flexibility and responsiveness of its people, and its commitment to the next generation of communications technology,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. `` Together we are stepping into the future of information management,'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer, said in the statement. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> will use private lines to connect the firm's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> headquarters with its 500 domestic branch offices and with offices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Berne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Switches in those foreign offices will serve as gateways for calls to and from other points. The system will be built around <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s existing backbone of private lines. The choice of <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> culminates a process that began last September when <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> asked for proposals from the three main long-distance companies, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two brothers have been indicted on charges of stealing more than $ 1.7 million in equipment leasing schemes involving <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, officials said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district attorney's office said a 17-count indictment charged <PERSON> Tuvia </PERSON> `` Ted'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, with illegal use of a legal tax-saving device last year. The Sterns sold printing equipment from two companies they owned to <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> so they could generate a cash profit. They then leased back the equipment so they could use it while writing off the lease cost as a business expense, according to the indictment. If the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> had kept the equipment in the first place, the only financial advantage would have been the annual depreciation for taxes. Such transactions are legal, but the indictment said the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> sold property to <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> that was `` greatly overvalued and in some instances was owned by others and in some instances did not exist.'' In one case, according to Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> bought the <ORGANIZATION> Mayflower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in June 1988 for $ 50,000 and sold it and nonexistent assets to <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> for $ 600,000 a few months later. To keep the scheme going, the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> allegedly used phony financial statements and invoices and fictitious eople. In another case, the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> used their lawyer's bank account to steal $ 265,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. The Sterns aface up to 25 years in jail if convicted of the top count of first-degree grand larceny.

 Energy futures prices weakened slightly Tuesday as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers struggled to reach an agreement on raising crude oil production. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, dipped 6 cents to $ 20.46 per 42-gallon barrel following Monday's rise of 38 cents. Prices of refined petroleum products posted larger declines. The crude contract held up well given the developments at the conference of ministers representing the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, an energy broker at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` All the news to me seems to be bearish. The bickering among members about production, quotas and allocations was a negative influence on energy prices,'' said <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>. Negotiations among the cartel ministers meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> bogged down Tuesday as they tried to agree on allotting a proposed cartel-wide oil production increase among its 13 member nations. Some members are believed to favor dividing any additional production evenly but <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> apparently has demanded a larger share while several other countries would like special treatment. On production, the ministers are considering a proposal to increase the cartel's output ceiling from the current 18.5 million barrels a day to 19.5 million in the July-December period. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, however, favors a boost to between 20 million barrels and 21 million barrels. As the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> discussions were taking place, a new report was released which estimated that current production by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members far exceeds the self-imposed quota. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations produced oil at a daily rate of 21 million barrels last month, the highest amount so far this year. Energy market analysts said the violence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the problems stemming from the explosion of a natural gas pipeline in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had little impact on prices Tuesday. These events had been among the factors responsible for Monday's gains. The July contract for No. 2 heating oil, which rose 1.87 cents Monday, fell 0.91 cent to 51.00 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The contract for July delivery of unleaded gasoline settled at 64.94 cents a gallon, off 0.86 cent, almost erasing Monday's increase of 0.95 cent.

The new consortium will continue to have relations with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, such as consulting on market surveys, <PERSON> Martre </PERSON> said, but the group will also be talking to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft manufacturers. The European companies and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> have been carrying out preliminary studies of a new military transport aircraft for several years, in anticipation of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s need to find a successor to the Hercules and the Transall, which is made jointly by <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> MBB </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has so far failed to come up with any definition of the kind of the aircraft that it requires. Industry observers said the Europeans decided to take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s intentions to break their formal ties with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>. The decision means they will be able to link up with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company that is eventually selected to produce the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> version of the aircraft.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> negotiations stalled Tuesday as cartel ministers tried to hammer out an agreement on how to allot a proposed cartel-wide production increase among its 13 member nations. `` I can certainly say there's a spirit of reaching an understanding. ... -LRB- But -RRB- a lot of work needs to be done,'' said Iranian Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON>. `` It's a deadlock,'' said a delegate from one nation, who demanded anonymity. Continuing talks over a possible hike in the official production ceiling came as a new report indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> lifted output in May to its highest level of the year, surpassing its current ceiling. An offical of one delegation said a proposal had been made to raise the cartel's output ceiling from the current 18.5 million barrels a day to 19.5 million in the July-December period. The additional production would be divided proportionately among all members, said the official, who demanded anonymity. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has insisted on a larger share and several other countries would like special treatment. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> told reporters he wanted <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to boost its daily production limit to between 20 million barrels and 21 million barrels. The nation persistently has pumped more than its individual quota, although <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> refused to say how much he would like of the proposed additional cartel output. `` As much as we can get we would love to have,'' he said. `` The key issue is to get everybody within the new umbrella of 20 or 20 plus -LRB- million barrels a day -RRB- as a new ceiling,'' said <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>. Other members have said no country should be given more output than others. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakshuki </PERSON> said if another country wins `` special treatment ... <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will ask for that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers have been trying to resolve their disputes since last Friday. They opened a formal strategy conference Monday before returning to private bargaining. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations agreed last November on a production ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day for the January-June period, well under actual output levels of that time, in an attempt to support a price of $ 18 a barrel for their oil. Prices have risen since then, with the price of a basket of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> now more than 40 percent above the level of late November. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark American crude, closed down 6 cents Tuesday at $ 20.46 a 42-gallon barrel. The ministers apparently have settled on retaining the $ 18 benchmark, although <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had recommended scrapping the target price. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> seems to be happy with a pricing level around $ 18,'' said <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a day in May to 21 million barrels, the highest amount so far this year. Higher production by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> accounted for much of the May increase, it said. The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report estimated <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> produced 4.8 million barrels a day in May. Its OPEC-set supply quota is 4.5 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> each produced about 2.8 million barrels a day in May, it said. The output for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> was estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day, well above their <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> supply quotas of about a million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> produced some 1.6 million barrels a day, ahead of its supply target of about 1.4 million barrels. The report estimated <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s production at 1.6 million barrels a day, the same as its quota, and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s at 300,000 barrels, up from its quota of 230,000 barrels. Other production estimates were: <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, 1 million barrels; <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, 700,000 barrels; <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, 1.2 million barrels; <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, 1 million barrels; and <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, 200,000 barrels.

<HEAD>Creditors Seek Involuntary Bankruptcy Against Electronics Retailer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of five creditors filed a petition Tuesday for involuntary bankruptcy against electronics retailer <PERSON> Crazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> to try to recoup $ 860,000 from the company that once boasted `` insane'' prices. Crazy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> has 20 days to contest the petition before it must liquidate its assets, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, an attorney for the creditors. The company also has the option of filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, he said. A Crazy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> spokesman, who would not give his name, said the company's board of directors was meeting late Tuesday and planned to issue a statement. The petition, filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, represents <ORGANIZATION> Cobra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynascan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phonemate </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Code-A-Phone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phones </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. Crazy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>, known for its frenetic broadcast commercials claiming that `` Our prices are insane!'' announced in March that it was closing 17 of its 43 stores overnight in a bid to cut losses. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>, N.J.-based company said a drop in sales compounded by a massive inventory shortage, excessive long-term debt and `` certain unprofitable locations'' had drained its working capital. In their petition, the five creditors claim <PERSON> Crazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> is liquidating its assets without taking into account the debts to its creditors. `` Crazy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> has been the subject of speculation about its financial condition for several months,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said in statement. `` A pending shareholder lawsuit, continued operating losses and the departure of key personnel have further eroded investor and supplier confidence in the discounter.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said an unofficial committee of major creditors that was formed to negotiate with <PERSON> Crazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> had failed to reach an accord. `` My clients believe that it is in their best interests ... that the bankruptcy court become involved,'' he said. Crazy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s stock closed at 25 cents a share in over-the-counter trading Tuesday, unchanged from the previous close. The stock is down from 53 cents in March and had been as high as $ 21 three years ago.

 The price of gold shot up nearly $ 12 an ounce in late trading Tuesday, while the dollar sagged. Some dealers said gold rallied in a belated response to the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but others said technical factors were behind the late spurt. The dollar was actually lower earlier Tuesday in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which is most sensitive to what happens in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 376.70 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 364.80 on Monday. That brought it back to its levels of early May, but still well below the levels of January, when it was over $ 400 an ounce. The rally began in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when some futures traders who had sold gold short in anticipation of a decline became nervous and decided to buy gold to even their books, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, senior metals analyst at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It seemed to feed on itself as the day progressed,'' he said. There was no major economic news to account for the retreat of the dollar after its gains Monday. A pattern of sharp, unexplained drops in the dollar indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might have sold dollars secretly, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, an investment officer in foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Several traders have speculated in the past two weeks that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and other central banks are trying to get extra impact from their intervention by concealing it more than in the past. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5665 to buy one pound, compared to $ 1.5815 late Monday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound rose to $ 1.5710 from $ 1.5655 on Monday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rosed 1.98 yen to a closing 142.63 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 143.28 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fell to 142.67 yen from 142.95. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.9735 West German marks, down from 1.9855; 1.7095 Swiss francs, down from 1.7140; 1.2010 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2019; 6.7060 French francs, down from 6.7455; and 1,434 Italian lire, down from 1,442 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday: 1.9850 West German marks, up from 1.9630; 1.7240 Swiss francs, up from 1.6950; 6.7360 French francs, up from 6.6645; 2.2370 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2010; 1,443.00 Italian lire, up from 1,416.50; 1.2015 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2003. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 3.76 a troy ounce to close at a bid of $ 365.44. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 365.25 per troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 366.25. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold dropped to a bid of $ 365.30 compared with $ 366.00 late Monday. But on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 379.90 a troy ounce from $ 367.50 on Monday.

<HEAD>Stocks Close Higher After Choppy Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stock market closed moderately higher after a choppy session Tuesday marked by continued program trading and nervousness about the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.62 to close at 2,496.32. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a margin of about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 927 up, 584 down and 500 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 187.57 million shares, up from 163.42 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 223.61 million shares. The market began the day on the up side, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average climbing up about 20 points. But the market gave back virtually all its gains in the early afternoon and then swung upward again before the close. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed Tuesday's volatility to continued uncertainty about the political upheaval in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and concern about <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> over the weekend However, he said stock prices gained support from firmness in the bond market. By late afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely-watched 30-year bond gained $ 3.75 for every $ 1,000 in face amount, while its yield, which moves in an opposite direction from its price, fell to under 8.40 percent from 8.43 percent late Monday. Program trading, which contributed to a sharp 37-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday, was again evident Tuesday, <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> predicted trading would remain choppy until Friday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues its producer price report for May. The markets believe the report, a key inflation indicator, may provide some clue as to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s next move. Despite Tuesday's uneven session, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said the market still appeared strong. `` Stocks had plenty of opportunity to head south, but they did n't and this tells me that momentum was up,'' he said But he also advised caution: `` The music is still being played _ I would just be dancing a little bit closer to the exits.'' Leading the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s most active list was <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, which rose -LCB- to 23 after <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> said it was selling five food businesses for $ 2.5 billion. The sales were expected as part of the company's plan to reduce debt following its acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. American Cynamid, which announced Monday it would acquire <ORGANIZATION> Praxis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biologics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 237 million in securities, was down 2 \ to 53 \ <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>, which said it was being bought out for $ 1.6 billion by a management-led investor group, was up -RCB- <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LRB- to 76 -RCB-, rebounding from sharp declines in previous sessions. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $ 16.662 billion, or 0.52 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 1.04 to 180.93. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index moved up 2.58 to 371.10, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index advanced 2.21 to 324.24.

<HEAD>Governor Touts Alaska Tourism, Says Tourists Have Nothing To Fear
From Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s governor and tourism officials, fearing that Americans picture their state as a soiled paradise since the biggest oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, began a damage-control tour Tuesday to promote the vast reaches unaffected by the disaster. `` If you went to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and if you wanted to see the oil, you would have to go to a pretty substantial expense and a lot of trouble to do so,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> told a news conference. Tourism is a $ 750 million-a-year industry for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and ranks behind only oil and seafood among the state's biggest industries, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials emphasized that as large as the March 24 spill was, it was virtually lost amid the state's huge unaffected expanses of land and water. <PERSON> Cowpwr </PERSON> said the spill affected only 2 percent of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s 6,640 miles of coastline. That included just 5 percent of the shoreline within <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, where the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground and spilled 10.9 million gallons of crude. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a tourism industry group, showed slides taken since the spill, portraying untouched beaches within the sound, a cruise ship crossing the sound, and sea lions in the area where the spill drifted. `` There's no hiding from the fact that it's been a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> said. `` But for visitors, few if any will see its impacts on these remote areas.'' Officials have no firm projections how many potential visitors may be deterred by the oil spill, but sport-fishing lodge operators have reported inquiries from their customers and some outright reservation cancellations, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. Like commercial fishermen, tour operators and others in tourism will be entitled to compensation from Exxon if they can show damages as a result of the spill, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. The state spent $ 10.8 million on tourism promotion in 1988, and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> budgeted $ 11.4 million for this year. This year's budget is supplemented by $ 4 million from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, part of which is financing this week's promotion trip to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as well as print and television advertising. One of the ads shows a picture of a smiling <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> without her beauty mark. `` Without it, the picture may have changed, but her beauty has n't,'' the ad reads. `` The same is true of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.'' In addition, 154,000 copies of a letter from <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> were sent to people who had inquired about visiting <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, assuring them the oil spill would not affect their travel plans. Before the spill, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> tourism officials predicted just over 780,000 people would visit the state this season, its 30th anniversary of statehood. That would have been up from 709,664 in 1988 and would match 1986, the best year ever, when a number of visitors to British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s Expo 86 world's fair included <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in their tours. Some visitors may be drawn to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> because of publicity about the spill and the environmental damage it wrought, officials said. Some entrepreneurs may even arrange tours of oil-fouled areas, Dow predicted. `` I think it's probably correct to say we're getting people up there who want to see the oil spill,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. But, he added, `` they're going to have a hard time.''

 <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board approved a $ 1.6 billion buyout offer Tuesday from a group that includes company management, railroad company <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and other investors, prompting hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw its own offer. The buyout group formed by investment banker <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which will hold a controlling interest in the railroad company, agreed to pay $ 45.50 cash per common share in cash and $ 4.50 per share of preferred stock. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped 75 cents to close at $ 47.50 a share <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. `` Employees and customers of <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> will benefit from the fact that our business plan calls for upgrading <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s most strategically important line, does not depend upon the sale of operating assets, and continues <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s role as a provider of quality transportation services,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmiege </PERSON>, who leads the management contingent of the buyout group. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which had been pursuing a $ 44 a share hostile takeover valued at $ 722 million, issued a statement saying it was terminating its tender offer. The group is <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder with an 8.8 percent stake `` <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates intend to evaluate their alternatives, which may include the disposition of some or all of the <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> common shares benefically owned by them; or holding some or all of such shares for sale pursuant to the merger agreement,'' the statement read. Based on approximately 19 million <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> shares outstanding and the assumption of <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> debt, the management group valued its buyout plan at $ 1.6 billion. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has committed $ 585 million in buyout financing and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has committed to provide up to $ 475 million in financing. <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> will hold a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> under the agreement, with minority positions held by management and <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. Union Pacific, the railroad and trucking company, will hold $ 100 million of stock that will be convertible into a minority position after five years. Officials said <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>'s financing structure will not require significant sales of operating assets to retire the debt caused by the takeover. But the firm will complete <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s previously announced plan to sell its Chicago-area commuter operations and will divest some real estate and surplus equipment. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> planned to sell <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s real estate, excess equipment and Chicago-area commuter lines if its takeover bid succeeded. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that operates in nine states, most of them in the Midwest. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> owns <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Pa.-based <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>. which has some 21,000 route miles, all west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Union Pacific relies heavily on the North Western's Chicago-to-Fremont, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, line for east-west freight traffic and accounts for about 40 percent of the North Western's shipments, analysts say `` We wanted to insure reliable and effective service to our customers into and out of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said of the takeover agreement in a telephone interview. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> has agreed with <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 115 million through 1992 to maintain and upgrade <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s east-west main line in order to improve rail quality and shorten delivery times. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> recently paid $ 1.5 million for an option to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, a regional line between <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Officials said the line would have served as a substitute for the North Western had a hostile takeover disrupted freight service. The offer by the Blackstone-led group was approved by a special <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> board committee that was evaluating bids for the Chicago-based rail company. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s union on Friday made a proposal to buy the company that would have given employees a one-third stake in the railroad.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Show First Gains in Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Demand for precious metals increased Tuesday because of the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, driving up the price of gold and silver on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, cotton prices continued their slide, grain and soybean futures fell, livestock and pork prices declined and energy futures were lower. After about three months of declining prices, gold and silver posted a solid gain as demand for the metal increased in the aftermath of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s domestic troubles. Gold prices settled $ 12.40 to $ 13.60 higher with the contract for delivery in June at $ 379.90 a troy ounce; silver was 16.7 cents to 19.5 cents higher with June at $ 5.431 a troy ounce. `` This is the first meaningful rally in the past three or four months,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` A lot of people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> have been sellers of gold and purchasers of dollars. That has stopped, causing the market to react positively.'' Investors often turn to gold and silver, which are looked upon as more stable investments, as a hedge in times of turmoil. Another factor in the buying of precious metals was the recommendation by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that its citizens leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and a slight decline Tuesday in the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. Cotton prices continued their downward spiral that began Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said there is concern the Chinese may cancel orders already made for cotton. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shippers are reluctant to ship for fear the cotton will be floating around at sea without a destination,'' he said. `` And even it it arrives in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, it may not get unloaded. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a major buyer of cotton, despite being one of the world's major producers. Cotton was 1.45 cents to 2 cents lower with July at 63.83 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures prices were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with wheat prices falling despite announcement of a major sale to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Monday's announcement of the sale of 1.85 million metric tons of wheat was expected to be a boost to wheat prices, but that did not occur. Corn prices were mostly lower on news that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> bought French maize rather than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, and on the lack of confirmation of sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. However, after the markets closed Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the sale of 300,000 metric tons of corn to the Soviets. Soybean prices fell as investors purchased old crop futures and sold new crop. Wheat settled 3 cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.88 \ a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.61 \ a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 1.62 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 -RCB- cents lower to 8 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.14 a Livestock and meat futures were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with with pork prices lower on <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reports of increased marketing and high cold storage figures. Cattle prices dropped in a carryover from hog prices and weak cash prices. Live cattle were .15 cent to .70 cent lower with June at 68.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .10 cent higher wtih August at 78.85 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower to .67 cent lower with June at 48.15 a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.83 cents to 2 cents lower with July at 30.45 cents a pound. Energy futures prices weakened on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> struggled to agree on allotting a proposed cartel-wide oil production increase among its 13 member nations. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 2 cents to 19 cents lower with July at $ 20.46 a barrel; heating oil was .78 cent to .91 cent lower with July at 51 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .10 cent higher with July at 64.94 cents a gallon.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is developing a plan that could use the machines that run its popular video games as part of a network for delivering information to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households, a spokeswoman for the company said Tuesday. The plan apparently would transform <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> units into inexpensive home computers providing a range of news, possibly about stock markets, travel and other topics. The units are plastic boxes, retailing for around $ 100, that hook up to television sets to display such hit <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> games as `` Super <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> 2,'' `` <PERSON> Zelda </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>,'' and `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s Punch-out.'' The company has held discussions with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to explore the technological possibilities of having <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> devices form part of an information delivery network, according to the spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> intends to pursue the concept and hopes to work out the mechanics of a plan by next year. No formal arrangements have been made with <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T or any other company, the spokeswoman said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T confirmed in a brief news release that it was discussing a number of possibilities with <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>. However, it stated that `` no business relationship has been agreed upon and no contracts have been signed.'' The announcement was issued in response to published reports that indicated <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> had joined forces to set up an information supplying network. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Main </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the American subsidiary of the <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, Japan-based <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, would n't elaborate on the plan in an article published Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal He also declined to identify what company might provide the database information.

<HEAD>Third World Falling Behind on $70 Billion Owed US Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Third World countries are falling behind on $ 70.67 billion worth of debt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which reports investigations to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, did not name the countries. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the number three debtor after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, has paid no interest on its foreign debt for over a year. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank regulators should make banks put up more reserves to protect their depositors against losses on those loans. It calculated that the regulators now demand reserves of only 5.1 percent, about $ 3.6 billion. It suggested that they should be insisting on 62.2 percent, nearly $ 44 billion. `` Because banks generally respond to reserve requirements by writing down assets by the required amounts, a decline in ther book value of their assets results,'' the office said in a recent note on figures to Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Though the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> did not say so, writing down a bank's assets reduces the amount of business it can do and makes the management look bad to depositors and stockholders. In a letter Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON> said the banks should put up more reserves. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks maintain lower reserve levels than almost all other industrialized countries,'' <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON> wrote. A bank is now only required to put up reserves when the regulators declare foreign loans it has made to be either a total loss or `` value-impaired.'' That means the debtors have not paid interest for six months or otherwise shown that they are in deep trouble. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank regulators next week are expected to discuss behind closed doors whether to classify loans to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> as `` value-impaired.'' The category already contains <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>. But their total debt is small compared with the major debtors <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities calculate that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> owes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks more than $ 8.5 billion. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has not paid interest for more than a year on its foreign debt, now estimated at over $ 60 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> thinks that the bank regulators should insist that the crediotr banks put aside reserves proportional to the price that a country's debt will fetch on the open market.

 Officials launched a petition drive Tuesday to keep <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Jeep plant in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> after a contract between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> expires in 1992. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Carty </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON>, who is leading the drive, said volunteers will try to collect 200,000 signatures from people asking <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> to keep the plant open. Local labor leaders are helping to organize the petition drive. <PERSON> Finkbeinder </PERSON> said `` a convoy of Jeeps'' will travel to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in the fall to deliver the petitions with the message: `` Manufacturing is not dead in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. Long live manufacturing in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. Long live Jeep.''

Company officials also have said they will negotiate a new contract with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 12 when the current accord expires. `` As far as <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is concerned, the petition drive is n't necessary because we have that agreement until 1992, which is a long time in the auto industry,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholl </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Private LBO Firm Backs $1.8 Billion Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A previously announced $ 1.8 billion buyout bid for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is backed by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> leveraged buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Clayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dubilier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, it was revealed Monday. The friendly offer for the hospital company, organized by minority shareholder Dr. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, is valued by the offerer at $ 24 a share. Of that, $ 21 a share is cash and the rest in securities. <ORGANIZATION> Clayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Dubilier </PERSON>, a private firm that financed the $ 960 million management buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kendall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in October, leads the buyout group, according to AMI. A special committee of the company's board is studying the offer, <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. The potential buyers set a June 15 deadline, and indicated they were willing to negotiate for a higher price, <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, one of several shareholders who have been pressing the company to boost its earnings and stock price, first offered to buy the company in March. Then he valued the offer at $ 24 a share and said the portion of that to be in the form of securities would range from $ 2 a share to $ 4 a share. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> owns 75 hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas.

<HEAD>Economist: One-Third of Thrift Industry Can't Meet Capital Requirements</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs to UPDATE with Wall comments.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional efforts to force the nation's thrifts to meet stringent capital requirements would push almost one-third of the industry into insolvency and keep home mortgage rates above 10 percent, the chief economist for a trade association said Tuesday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, director of the economics department for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, told <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift executives that as many as 973 thrifts, with $ 768 billion in assets, would fail to meet requirements that they maintain 3 percent tangible capital. The industry has been pushing for capital requirements, which either include `` goodwill'' _ the amount of net worth above the value of tangible assets _ or a several-year period to transform the goodwill into money. Opponents have objected to including goodwill because it is intangible. Speaking at the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> convention, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> said many lawmakers apparently feel `` more is better and tougher is what they want to do,'' but he said it is a mistake `` if you have to kill a third of the industry in order to get this done the day after tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said more stringent capital requirements would force institutions to shrink, causing them to sell off mortgages, which in turn would tighten the market and keep interest rates high. He predicted home mortgage rates will average 11 percent this year, falling only slightly to 10.6 percent by 1991. But <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said the 2,000 remaining thrifts that would not be affected by the more stringent requirements `` are plain vanilla housing lenders for the most part, always have been.'' Critics have blamed much of the industry's problems on savings and loans that strayed too far from their roots as home lenders. This year alone regulators have placed more than 200 thrifts under their control awaiting passage of legislation that would provide more than $ 157 billion over the next 10 years to rescue the industry. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> favors the more stringent capital requirements, but the legislation is not expected to come up for a floor vote before next week as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sifts through more than 100 amendments. In other forecasts, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> said the current business expansion, already the nation's longest during peacetime, could continue at moderate levels for up to two years. But for that to happen, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> system must stop worrying about inflation. Until recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing up interest rates to keep inflation under control. But <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said world markets are forcing the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to rethink that strategy through the strength of the dollar. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> said the inflation rate will rise to 4.8 percent this year before falling to 4.0 percent by 1991. Later, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, told the group that figures to be released Wednesday indicate the evaporation of deposits from the nation's thrifts continued to decline in April, a traditionally down month as taxpayers pay Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. In April 1988, thrift deposits grew by $ 1.2 billion as investors shifted money from uncertain stock and mutual fund investments. So far this year, however, $ 28.5 billion has been withdrawn from thrifts, including a record $ 10.8 billion in January. Wall also said that a secret survey by the bank board found some <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION> thrifts not doing enough to sell distressed real estate. Most federal regulators who have visited <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in recent months have taken pains to reassure local officials that the government will not dump on the market properties acquired through the rescue of hundreds of savings and loans and banks. But Wall told reporters Tuesday the bank board had sent `` shoppers'' into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and discovered that some of the properties held by institutions recapitalized last year through the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION> had not even been listed for sale. Wall suggested that the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION> thrifts _ which were created last year through the consolidation and sale of ailing institutions _ may have taken the `` no dumping'' promise too literally.

<HEAD>Prime Drops Court Appeal Against MAI Basic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has dropped its appeal to the 1st <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> seeking to enjoin <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s unsolicited takeover bid because <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION>'s recent revision of its offer made the appeal irrelevant. `` It no longer made sense to pursue that deal,'' Prime spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> said MAI's offer of $ 19.50 cash per share would actually be $ 14.80 per share on a fully diluted basis and `` does not reflect the intrinsic value of the company.'' Prime is encouraging stockholders to resist MAI's offer, he said. Prime's board of directors postponed the company's annual stockholders meeting from June 14 to July 26 to `` provide for an orderly, active and effective exploration of all financial alternatives,'' officials said in a statement Tuesday. Prime's board has said it is discussing acquisition possibilities with interested parties and is contemplating a possible recapitalization. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> officials said Prime's consideration of other takeover offers was a `` a deliberate attempt to confuse Prime stockholders.'' Last Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> lowered its tender offer 50 cents a share because of Prime's projected results in 1989 and 1990. MAI, which is about one-fourth the size of Prime, which is based in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, owns about 1.2 million shares of Prime stock. Since it launched its hostile bid in November, 33.3 million shares were tendered under the $ 20 offer, representing nearly 70 percent of the outstanding shares and just under 50 percent of Prime's stock on a fully diluted basis. <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> said Prime's executive council has agreed to meet with <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> at an unspecified future date.
