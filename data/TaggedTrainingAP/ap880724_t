 A six-man crew determined to break the record for a trans-Atlantic voyage set off Sunday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> aboard a $ 6 million speedboat. <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON>, 57, and his crew passed Ambrose Light just outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> at 11:26 a.m. Sunday to start the race across the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bishop </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Isles of <LOCATION> Scilly </LOCATION>, race spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said. The 110-foot, 11,460 horsepower Gentry-Continental Proud Bird, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, will attempt to cross the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in less than 72 hours. The current record time of 3 days, 8 hours and 31 minutes was set in 1986 by Englishman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and several other companies, set his record on June 29, 1986, in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Challenger II. It was <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>'s second attempt at the crossing. His first attempt, in May 1985, failed when the original <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION> sank 138 miles short of the finish. Crew member <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, speaking by radio-telephone, said the Proud Bird had passed over the Nantucket Shoals about 3:30 p.m. Sunday. The vessel was cruising at 50 knots through six-foot swells and fog, he said. `` We'd like a little smoother seas,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Basically the autopilot is doing the driving and we're just kind of cruising along,'' he said. However, the boat's size, speed and sea conditions were making for a rough passage. `` It's not a comfy ride. There's a rolling and pitching motion and when you hit these swells. You feel a few inches shorter and like you've been punched in the stomach,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> reported.

 Communist rebels said Sunday that President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has failed to lift the country out of crisis and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to send troops to prop up the government. The rebels, who have been battling for power for 20 years, issued a statement on the eve of the president's state of the nation address. Meanwhile, four soldiers, a policeman and two guerrillas were killed in three separate battles across the country during the last 24 hours, the military said Sunday. The rebels said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` can not cover up the basic truth that the Filipino nation remains in deep crisis, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control and interference continue to fetter national development, that the nation is being ever more polarized along class and political lines. `` Direct armed intervention by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops is a distinct possibility _ meaning a much bloodier war for the Filipino people _ should the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists judge that the Aquino regime can no longer stop the general advance of the people's democratic revolution and protect strategic American interests.'' Copies of the statement were were delivered to news agencies by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front is an umbrella for 12 rebel groups, including the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its 25,000-member <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The government gave no official response to the rebels' statement Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is to address the nation Monday when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes for its second session after a month-long recess. In the fighting, the army said that on <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 230 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, communist rebels ambushed and killed four soldiers Saturday. On <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> island, one of three attackers Saturday shot and killed a policeman as he left his home near the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Also Saturday, two suspected communist rebels were killed in a gun battle after they wounded a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> constabulary captain in <LOCATION> Cabanatuan </LOCATION>, 30 miles northeast of the base. The military said last week nearly 2,000 people have been killed in insurgency-related violence across the country in the first six months of the year.

 Two drug-dealing gangs waged a gunfight over control of the local cocaine trade, killing 11 people and wounding dozens of others, police reported Sunday. They said the battle in the village of <LOCATION> Dos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>, 240 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, began Thursday when a Colombian gang ambushed Peruvians as they transported about 260 pounds of cocaine paste to a rural airfield. The firefight lasted for several hours and at least six Peruvian traffickers and five Colombians were killed, according to police. Witnesses told police that dozens of people were wounded, but officials had no specific figures. A Peruvian police patrol arrived in the area shortly after the battle ended and confiscated the cocaine, according to the authorities.

<TEXT>
 Whether it's <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the next taker of the presidential oath of office may find the federal government more miserly about paying part of the tab when he kicks up his heels at the end of the day. The reason: Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., has slipped new rules into the conference report of the new defense authorization bill now awaiting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature They require the next <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to reimburse the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for equipment and personnel it supplies for inaugural balls and other private inaugural events. So, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> says, when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> steps out on the dance floor at an invitation-only inaugural ball next Jan. 20, `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer will no longer have to foot part of the bill.'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, citing a recent <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study, said that when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was inaugurated for the second time in 1985, `` many of the events were largely planned, staffed and executed by federal employees at a cost to the taxpayer of $ 15.5 million.'' The Pentagon alone spent $ 10 million,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> says. And it used 8,400 military personnel. According to <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> staff members and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, hundreds of uniformed military personnel were used at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nine inaugural balls and galas to do everything from checking the fur coats to playing in the bands and orchestras. Service members served as VIP escorts, driving visiting celebrities around the capital. The cars were lent by American auto makers, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> maintained them, and filled the gas tanks. Members of the inaugural committees had military drivers for as long as six weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> personnel served as escorts at inaugural events, under orders to mix and mingle and to see that no guests were ignored. They also were used to set up the events themselves, and to organize receiving lines once they were under way. Military photographers and cameramen took still and video pictures of the guests, providing copies on request free of charge. `` They took tens of thousands of pictures,'' a <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> staff member said. Under the new guidelines, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inaugural committee must reimburse the Pentagon for the costs of whatever resources or personnel are used to supply private inaugural events. The inaugural ceremony itself would not be included because by tradition and history it is a public event. Nor would the inaugural parade down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue from the Capitol. But compensation would be required for <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> services to private inaugural functions. The new Proxmire inaugural rules have one other twist. In the past, a <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> staff member said, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have received complaints that service men and women were being required to take part in private, partisan inaugural events, often to perform duties they felt were beneath the dignity of the uniform. Under the new rules, uniformed members of the armed services could be used at private, partisan inaugural celebrations _ but only if they volunteer to take part. And the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would have to be reimbursed for the time spent. `` These new provisions provide clear and strict guidelines for the future,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. `` It has taken eight years to get movement on this issue, and while not every loophole has been closed, the major abuses now are corrected,'' he said.

 A chartered fishing boat with 48 people aboard collided with a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> navy submarine and quickly sank Saturday near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, leaving at least three people dead and 27 missing, police said. The 92-foot boat, chartered for a weekend fishing expedition, sank less than two minutes after the collision, said police in the nearby port city of <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>. They said 19 people were rescued from the boat but a 38-year-old man died in a hospital. Divers subsequently recovered two bodies on Sunday, said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard None of the 75 men aboard the diesel-powered submarine were reported injured, said officials with the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s navy. Officials said Sunday that divers located the boat at a depth of more than 150 feet. Officials said about 80 divers and 40 boats were taking part in the search. The <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the cause of the accident was still under investigation and captains of both vessels had been called in for questioning. According to <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television, the collision occurred after one of the vessels swerved to the right to avoid another boat. Television news reports showed the submarine floating on the surface near the accident site with no apparent damage. A handful of men on its deck and hull scanned the surrounding waters and life rafts were lined along its top. Police officials said the submarine, the 2,200-ton Nadashio, hit the fishing boat, the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru, Saturday afternoon about two miles off the port of <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> near the mouth of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> is 28 miles south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishimura </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told a nationally televised news conference that the submarine was cruising on the surface on its way back to <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> after a training exercise in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The fishing boat, from the nearby port of <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, was leaving <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, he said. Authorities were still investigating the cause of the incident, he said. Visibility at the time of the accident was reportedly good. More than 700 ships a day pass through the entrance of the bay, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who was attending meetings of his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Karuizawa </LOCATION>, returned to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after hearing of the accident, news reports said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> expressed regret over the accident, the worst involving <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> vessels and civilian boats since World War II, defense officials said. It was the first collision in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> between a submarine and a Japanese civilian ship since 1981, when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear submarine hit a freighter, killing two people, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. The mouth of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is known for its congestion of military vessels, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval ships, ocean-going vessels, ferries, fishing boats and privately owned yachts and sightseeing boats. <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> is the site of a major <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval base. The submarine, built by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, was commissioned in March 1984. It has two diesel engines and is equipped with six torpedo tubes.

 Two areas of Yellowstone National Park were evacuated Saturday because of forest fires in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, while residents of 20 homes near <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, returned after the forest fire that forced their evacuation was controlled. Fires also burned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and several large fires burned in remote areas of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Yellowstone National Park officials said Saturday the south entrance to the park will be closed for several days. The Grant Village Hotel and a campground in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> were closed earlier in the day, and visitors and employees moved out as a precaution because a fire had crept to within one-half mile of <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. `` We had strong and erratic winds -LRB- Friday -RRB-, a windstorm blew trees down on the road,'' said park fire information officer <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. `` The same wind also kicked the fire in and had it moving toward <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Village </PERSON>.'' In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> border, 200 firefighters were strung out along the two-mile-long northern flank of the North Fork fire on the Idaho-Wyoming border that was burning mainly inside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. Officials had worried that high winds forecast for Saturday would aggravate the 600-acre blaze. But cloud cover kept both the temperature and the wind from getting out of control, and crews made progress on fire lines on the north flank, he said. `` We were anticipating it could double today if we got the wind. But if we have another day like this, we might be coming close -LRB- to containment -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. Other fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> included the 14,000 - to 15,000-acre Clover fire in a remote backcountry area Wind created problems for the 830 firefighters trying to contain the <LOCATION> Mink </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire in northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> that charred 21,300 acres in the <LOCATION> Bridger-Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> and burned to within a mile of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s boundary. A containment line had been established around about 80 percent of the fire's southern end, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldapfel </PERSON>, fire information officer. In southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Poison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire in Sawtooth National Forest southwest of Twin Falls was burning out of control Saturday. More than 150 firefighters battled the blaze, which had charred over 2,000 acres of the tinder-dry high desert since Thursday. Residents evacuated from about 20 homes bordering the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> -RRB- Indian Reservation returned home Saturday after firefighters cut a containment line around a 2,420-acre blaze on the reservation. However, officials were not yet calling the fire contained because 40 percent of the material inside the line was unburned, said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wenatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> official. About 200 firefighters, including volunteers and crews from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, used bulldozers and hand tools to cut the line around most of the fire, with the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> forming the rest of the boundary, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> estimated the fire got within 50 yards of at least one home. The houses were evacuated Friday. Also Saturday, a 1,500-acre fire at the adjacent <LOCATION> Colville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> -RRB- Indian Reservation was contained, said <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> fire control officer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Quill </PERSON>. The blaze was blamed on farm equipment operating in high grasses. About 50 people who were forced from their homes by a forest fire on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kalispell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, were allowed to return Saturday after crews managed to get a line around the 120-acre blaze. No homes were lost although several were threatened. `` We only have one road closed, and that's to try to find out where it -LRB- the fire -RRB- started,'' said <LOCATION> Flathead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>. Authorities believed the blaze, which broke out Friday, was man-caused. Hundreds of firefighters battled about a half-dozen other fires in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Two fires were being allowed to run their course because they are in wilderness areas, including the <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire in the Scapegoat Wilderness north of <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON>. Authorities closed about 75,000 acres of the 250,000-acre wilderness on Saturday due to the blaze. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, a forest spokeswoman, said the blaze grew substantially Saturday but that no estimate on its size was available because smoke obscured much of the area. Earlier, the fire was reported to have consumed 2,000 acres. A brush fire about eight miles north of <LOCATION> Canon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, grew to 1,700 acres Saturday afternoon as about 330 firefighters and aircraft battled the blaze in steep terrain on <LOCATION> Cooper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> blamed the growth of the fire on winds. `` The wind has changed directions about three times today, and now it's fairly calm again,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The blaze, which broke out Thursday, is named the `` Dinosaur fire'' because it is near a fossil site. Before the Dinosaur fire, fires had burned about 21,000 acres across <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> since last weekend. The other fires were all contained by Thursday. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a fire sparked by fireworks was contained Saturday after it burned about 420 acres of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> near <ORGANIZATION> Yucaipa </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Melody Fountain. And in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, firefighters finally contained two fires in <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after the blazes charred about 10,800 acres. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>, said full control of the blazes was expected by Monday night. Damage from the fires totaled $ 11 million, including timber and property losses and fire suppression efforts, said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> CDF </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION>, 150 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and a few miles west of the fires. Six homes, nine other buildings and eight vehicles were lost since the arson-suspected blazes broke out Tuesday. Also Saturday, firefighters battled a 200-acre brush fire near Flaming Gorge Dam on the Utah-Colorado border and several small fires near <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, authorities said.

 Moslem separatists burned seven rural schools in the southern province of <LOCATION> Narathiwat </LOCATION> in an apparent attempt to disrupt <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s general elections on Sunday, a district official said. The official, who asked not to be identified, said the rebels torched the schools and a health clinic in isolated areas of three districts in the province after midnight Saturday. Polling booths had been set up in some of the schools and the official linked the raids to efforts by Moslems to disrupt the voting that began at 8 a.m. -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT -RRB-. A total of 3,606 candidates from 16 parties are vying for 357 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. Since no party is expected to gain a majority, several parties will probably team up to choose a prime minister, who then forms a government. Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON>, who does not belong to any party, is widely predicted to return to his post, heading a coalition of several parties. He has held office since 1980. The district official, contacted by telephone, said four of the schools burned to the ground while three others and the clinic were damaged.

But he has not said whether he would accept another term.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Sunday that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raids into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were a violation of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for an end to the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war.

<HEAD>Exhibition Offers Intimate Look at Canada's Eccentric Musical
Genius</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 He wore a wool scarf and gloves in summer and lived like a hermit, communicating with the outside world mostly by telephone. But when <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> died of a stroke nine days after his 50th birthday in 1982, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> lost not only a notorious eccentric but one of its greatest musicians. For the first time since the pianist's death, an exhibition at the National Library in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> provides an intimate look at <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s life, from his checkered cloth cap to the room keys he collected at hotels across the continent, including an entire set from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Stanhope Hotel Fortunately for posterity, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> was a pack rat who set aside one room of his apartment on <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> for scores, scripts, letters, programs, souvenirs and assorted junk. `` He wrote everything down on pads. You can almost follow him through each day,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, head of the library's music manuscript collection The exhibit runs through mid-September. A packing list reminds <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> to bring Valium and <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION> for his nerves, and a TV Guide. A 1966 commentary for the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says in red ball point, `` Sometimes it seems to me that <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> has had a rather better press than he deserves.'' A letter from his grandmother recommends a mustard pack for his sore back, and <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> commiserates with an ailing <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> -LRB- `` Dear Leonardo'' -RRB- by offering some tips on hypochondria. `` I have several titles for diseases which I am expecting to have in later life but have not yet had occasion to make use of.'' After a piano technician dislocated <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s shoulder with a backslap, the pianist distributed a notice requesting that no one offer to shake his hand. `` This will eliminate embarrassment all around,'' it said. A Canadian celebrity at 15, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s international career had a sensational start. He landed a lucrative <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> contract the day after his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debut in 1955, and the first of more than 100 discs, <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goldberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variations </ORGANIZATION>, is still rated a classic. He suddenly abandoned the concert platform in 1964 in pursuit of what he saw as a purer musical experience in the recording studio. He eventually became his own producer, controlling a mixing board the way a conductor directs an orchestra. He loved the microphone and dedicated much of his time to radio and TV documentaries. A night owl, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> rented a studio at <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s Inn on the Park because it was the only place in town he could get something to eat in the early hours, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. The exhibit features <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s favorite Steinway, his cluttered pigeon-hole desk and the rickety card-table chair his father modified as a piano stool. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> preferred a low-slung chair so that his fingers lay flat along the keyboard, the antithesis of the pounding romantic style he abhorred. An animal lover, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> left his worldly goods to the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The library was allowed to purchase the collection of 20,000 items, packed in 226 boxes, on condition it organize an exhibit. The display tours the rest of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> later this year, and negotiations are under way with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European museums. The most personal documents were withheld, but <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said there was evidence of `` two or three relationships'' with women that did not last long. In retrospect, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s career is filled with irony. He searched for musical clarity and control in what he termed the `` backbone'' of a score and dismissed virtuoso playing and tonal beauty for its own sake. However, he marred some recordings by humming along with the music, a habit critics considered an affectation. `` Readers will find the groans and croons intolerable,'' the Penguin Guide says of one Bach recording. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> preferred the piano to the harpsichord and played no part in the rediscovery of original instruments and pitch that has revolutionized baroque listening in the 1980s. He saw nothing wrong with splicing dozens of takes for one definitive performance and envisioned an era when recordings, adjusted electronically by home listeners, would entirely replace public concerts. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> holds an Olympian place in Canadian music. `` As a cultural symbol, he grows in stature every year, both as a true Canadian original and as a certified hero of modernist performers,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett-Green </PERSON>, music critic for The Globe and Mail.

 About 20,000 people formed a human chain around the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> air station in <LOCATION> Atsugi </LOCATION> on Sunday to protest noisy night landings at the base. Three times during the peaceful, 40-minute protest the demonstrators joined hands for about five minutes around the 10-mile perimeter of the base. Participants shouted `` Give us a quiet night!'' There was no immediate reaction to the demonstration by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities at the base. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilots use <LOCATION> Atsugi </LOCATION>, 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, to practice night landings, leading to frequent protests about jet noise from residents of the densely populated area.

 Vigilance is needed if the beauty of Olympic National Park is to be preserved, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said at the park's 50th birthday party. `` There are those who suggest that having already established the park lands, their preservation is assured, and there is little more to be done with them, for them, to provide for this adequate protection and maintenance,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said Saturday. But there's `` much to be done if these places are to fulfill their heritage,'' he warned the more than 500 people at Saturday's ceremonies <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> noted that more than 300 million people annually visit the nation's parks, compared with 16 million visitors in 1938. `` Our park system continues to grow. And we need to continue to grow,'' to preserve such outdoor areas for future generations, he said. President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> voiced those same sentiments before signing the legislation, sponsored by local Congressman <PERSON> Mon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallgren </PERSON>, that created the park five decades ago. `` I think you can count on my help in getting that national park, not only because we need it for us old people and you young people, but for a whole lot of young people who are going to come along in the next hundred years of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> residents in 1937. On June 29, 1938, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> signed a bill setting aside 634,000 acres to be preserved as Olympic National Park. Today, the park is 922,000 acres of glacier-capped mountains, alpine meadows, temperate rain forest and ocean coastline. The nation's third-most-visited national park, with more than 3 million a year, Olympic remains one of the wildest. The non-profit <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, as part of a nationwide assessment of land-acquisition needs, has proposed about 180,000 acres be added to further protect important watersheds and habitat. A study of ways to maintain national parks' integrity into the 21st century is under way by a task force of <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> managers, <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said. Entrance fees, such as those which were imposed last year at Olympic National Park, help provide such research funds, along with local resource management, he added. Along with preserving the parks, officials also need `` to continue to explore the cultural and recreational interests of special populations, minorities and international visitors to ensure that the parks are truly available for the benefit and enjoyment of all,'' <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said. Other issues to be addressed include protection of endangered species, air and water pollution and encroaching development outside the parks, <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said. He also called for `` improved cooperation among adjacent land owners and land management agencies'' outside the park, as well as the academic and scientific communities' expanded involvement with park affairs.

<HEAD>New Orleans Struggles To Meet Financial Obligations For Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hosting the Republican National Convention will cost the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> roughly $ 5.5 million in cash, and the effort to raise that money through donations apparently will go right down to the wire. `` We've raised $ 4.2 million as of last Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and head of the fund drive. `` That puts us pretty much on target. Maybe a little behind,'' he added. `` We wanted to finish up Aug. 1 _ I think we're more likely to finish up that first or second week of August.'' The convention begins the third week of August, running Aug. 15-18 in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Superdome. Raising money in a city still beset by hard economic times has n't been easy, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> concedes. But he insists the money is being scraped together with a minimum of arm-twisting. `` In a community like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, `` the private sector and individuals in the community are prepared to come to the table to help out the city.'' Without question, the city needed help. Reeling from 10 percent unemployment and declining tax revenue, Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> and the city council tirelessly pursued the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, luring the party to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Superdome with the promise of $ 8 million in financial support for the convention. <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> and company are banking on the convention being a huge economic boon to the community, not only because of it will spur a projected $ 137 million in spending, but also because all the publicity could attract new business. `` The $ 8 million was both in cash and in kind,'' said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>'s chief administrative officer. `` In kind'' contributions, with an estimated value of $ 2.5 million to $ 3 million, included use of the city's parks, a performing arts theater, the municipal auditorium and other places for meetings, office space and entertainment. Cash contributions, <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> said, include money for a new million-dollar light system and a half-million-dollar sound system to be used by the Republicans in the Superdome. Security, including overtime for police, will eat up a lot of the money, <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> said, along witth the cost of building stages, media platforms, seats and a raised `` false floor'' to hide cables. There's also a computer system for the convention staff, and insurance. The city's prospects for coming up with the money looked dim for a time earlier this year. The Greater New Orleans Convention Fund, headed by oil millionaire <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, was struggling. After raising about $ 2 million in contributions, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> publicly complained in May that donations were lagging. That prompted the <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> administration to appoint a new committee, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Special Events Fund, headed by <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trail </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Freeport-McMoRan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the local Chamber of Comerce. Still assisted by <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s group, the special events fund took an aggressive, more focused approach, zeroing in on individual chamber members, the tourist and hotel industry and major corporations. So far, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, the tactic has worked, netting contributions ranging from $ 150 from small businesses to more than $ 200,000 from major corporations. The city has so far been able to meet contractural obligations arising from construction in the dome and Republican convention officials said last week preparations for the convention were progressing on schedule.

 A grisly cycle of murders and reprisal killings by leftists and rightists is raising fears of a breakdown in law and order and threatening efforts to promote democracy and protect human rights. `` Hardly a day passes without a murder or more being headlined in our newspapers,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent statement. `` Our sensibilities are being battered day in and day out, with reportage of killings and ambuscades, of slaughter and violence _ acts of terrorism all,'' the bishops said. According to the military's <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, at least 65 people, most of them police, soldiers and anti-communist civilians, were slain in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area by the rebel <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the first six months of the year Those attacks have led to formation of right-wing `` death squads,'' which methodically target trade unionists, leftists and social activists in an apparent bid to undercut their influence in politics. Victims of the rightists include at least five Filipino human rights lawyers. A prominent leftist university president, <PERSON> Nemesio </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>, has been wounded twice in two assassination attempts in the past seven months. The violence is not limited to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Nearly 40 people have been slain this year in politically motivated violence in <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Similar killings have been reported in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION> and other major cities. Several regional officials of the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> have dropped out of the organization in fear since the group's national chairman, <PERSON> Lean </PERSON> <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON>, was slain last September. The murder was not solved. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON>'s group was among the social activist organizations that rallied behind <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in the February 1986 revolt that toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who became president on the promise of restoring democracy and human rights, has called for an end to the violence. She warns that the unbridled killings will erode public confidence in her government. But Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s pledge to restore democracy has not been enough to quell the 19-year Communist insurgency, which expanded during the 20-year rule of her ousted predecessor. The killings underscore Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s fragile control of the police and armed forces. Military dissidents were responsible for a series of coup attempts that rocked the Aquino government, and leftists claim police and soldiers have been behind many of the right-wing killings. Those arrested in a June 30 attack on Prudente include five <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> policemen and a member of a government-backed anti-communist vigilante group organized by police. <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>, who was jailed under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for alleged ties to a leftist assassination team, had been accused by police of harboring communists at his <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>. `` Their interpretation of democracy is some kind of police state,'' <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON> said of his attackers. `` It's no different from the communist society that they have been castigating.'' `` We are one of those victims caught in the cross fire between the extreme left and the extreme right,'' he was quoted as saying by the Sunday Inquirer Magazine. Inability to curb the violence also threatens to undermine public support for the policy of all-out war against the communists, which Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> unveiled after peace talks with the rebels collapsed in January 1987. Liberal Filipinos have begun to complain that the `` total war'' campaign is polarizing society and encouraging violence not only against doctrinaire Marxists but also against those campaigning legally for social and economic reform. `` The human rights issue calls for an urgent reassessment of the counterinsurgency policy that has forced the government to trade its humanist soul in exchange for short-term political stability provided by support of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>,'' wrote prominent columnist <PERSON> Amando </PERSON> <PERSON> Doronila </PERSON> in The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this year, the rebels claimed they would scale down assassinations because of the alarm the killings generated among the urban middle class, which the communists hope to recruit to their cause. But last week, <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, spokesman of the rebel <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Boncayao </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigade </PERSON>, said killings would continue as long as the Aquino government fails to curb the rightists. `` As the Aquino government continues to protect and refuse to punish criminals in uniform, so shall the <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> resolve the bring these people the revolutionary justice they deserve,'' he said.

<HEAD>Coal Burner Could Curtail Hospital Waste Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hospitals grappling with mounting infectious waste may soon get help from an unlikely source: the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s coal research program. A specialized boiler could solve problems associated with disposing of surgical gloves, gowns, syringes and needles _ and at the same time, boost coal production by as much as 5 million tons per year, <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> said. Department officials said in interviews last week that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> has entered a cost-sharing agreement with Good Samaritan Hospital of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, for a demonstration project involving the boiler. An early stumbling block could be cost. A boiler of the size needed for a large hospital may not yet be economical, although the government believes research will ultimately lower the cost, said <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>. The problem of medical waste disposal has been graphically demonstrated this summer by the needles, syringes and other debris washing up on beaches in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and other states. Some beaches have been closed, and the source of the pollution has not yet been found. `` Applying clean-burning coal technology to hospital waste disposal is a possible ` spin-off' of our program that could not have come at a better time,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wampler </PERSON>, assistant energy secretary for fossil energy. `` Hospitals are struggling with the problem of growing amounts of infectious waste, and it translates directly into a dollars and cents issue. The expense of discarding this material is increasing the costs of medical care.'' The experimental coal-burning device is called a `` fluidized bed boiler.'' As envisioned by <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>, it would enable hospitals to burn waste while producing energy for heat or steam at the hospital. Widespead use of the boiler could create a market for as much as 3 million to 5 million tons of additional coal production a year, the department said. But the main objective of the experiment is for hospitals to efficiently dispose of infectious materials and avoid burdensome hauling costs. Large hospitals, particularly those treating AIDS patients, can pay up to $ 300,000 per year to transport waste to incinerators or other disposal facilities. The boiler is part of an effort by the federal government and private industry in the last 10 years to develop new ways of burning coal without harming the environment. Most conventional boilers burn coal rapidly at a temperature of up to 3,000 degrees. In a fluidized bed boiler, the coal burns more slowly at a lower temperature, giving it time to interact with limestone, which acts as a sponge to absorb pollutants. `` It's at about 1,600 degrees, which is almost ideal for disposing of the waste material in hospitals,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` That's the temperature at which the toxins break down or are destroyed.'' The boiler has been used commercially to produce energy, but has not been tried as an incinerator for medical wastes, according to <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Markel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> While coal is among the least expensive of fuels, the boiler can also run on other materials such as wood chips or rubber tires. <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> said it has already paid $ 93,000 to help design the one-year project, whose total cost of $ 961,800 is to be shared by the department, the Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> York-Shipley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, which is one of the contractors.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>' efforts to tame the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> are enabling barge traffic to scrape along in spite of this summer's record low water and the river's natural tendencies, <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officials say. `` What the river wants to do is wiggle back and forth. What we're trying to do is stabilize the channel,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a historian with the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, Miss. Strangled by a lack of rain, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has dropped to more than 20 feet below normal at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and sand buildups have caused traffic jams involving hundreds of barges. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s flow is expected to fall to 20 percent of normal at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> before the drought is over, and towboat operators say they'll lose more than $ 60 million this summer because of reduced traffic. On July 10, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> registered a record low of 10.7 feet below zero on the river gauge at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and the flow of water rushing past the city was 115,000 cubic feet per second. Zero is an arbitrary mark set at 183.91 feet above sea level. At what the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> calls `` full bank,'' the flow at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> is 1.3 million cfs and the river measures 34 feet above zero. The normal flow for July is 411,000 cfs. The record low flow of 78,000 cfs was set in 1936 when the river measured zero on the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> gauge. Since then, the main channel has been made narrower and deeper. In the old days when the river was left to wander, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> often split into two or more channels and formed big winding loops. In the 1930s and'40s, the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> cut off 16 of those loops to straighten the channel and shortened the Lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> by 150 miles. This year's low water has revealed stone dikes and huge concrete slabs that <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officials say are more critical than ever to keeping the river open to barges. The dikes, sticking out into the water like long, skinny fingers, force the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s main channel toward the middle of the riverbed, while mile upon mile of concrete revetment _ a blanket of concrete slabs _ keeps the river from forming loops by eroding into the bank. The river can be more than a mile across from bank to bank, but its main channel is often only 500 to 600 feet wide. The drought has cut that to less than 200 feet in some areas. Narrowing the river and preventing it from flowing slowly around a series of bends causes the main channel to dig itself deeper. In spite of record lows, the Lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> remains 25 to 40 feet deep in some places. But towboats are running into trouble at the so-called `` crossings'' where the river channel winds back and forth across the riverbed. The current slackens and sand and sediment settle out, sometimes putting the river at less than nine feet deep, the minimum generally needed for barges and towboats. The Corps has identified more than 30 troublesome crossings where dredging will likely be needed this summer between <LOCATION> Caruthersville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, Miss.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> moved away from quiet diplomacy and got tough last week as he sought to resolve a dispute over an obscure mountain region whose importance has grown far beyond its contested borders. The Soviet leader's handling of the problem offers some insight into how far he is prepared to go in allowing more openness and giving people a greater say in how they are governed. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the struggle over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mostly Armenian enclave in the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, has inflicted immense damage on perestroika, his reform program. He warned it could doom his plans to modernize Soviet society. Addressing the Soviet leadership Monday at a special session of the Supreme Soviet's Presidium, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said: `` If we fail to find the solution to this question today _ and we must find it _ this would have far-reaching consequences and would affect all perestroika.'' The immediate issue is the future of the sparsely populated, largely undeveloped region in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The ethnic Armenian majority set out in February to secede from largely Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and join predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. But in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a patchwork quilt of 15 republics shared by more than 100 distinct ethnic and national groups, redrawing maps is a dangerous business. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Presidium, the top executive body of government, served notice they were not about to open that <PERSON> Pandora </PERSON>'s box. Clearly, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, is not a guarantee of free speech as practiced in Western democracies, and democratization does not sanction a challenge to one-party rule. The government has tolerated massive demonstrations _ including some in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that have drawn hundreds of thousands, perhaps even a million people, according to witness accounts. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said redrawing the borders would constitute an abuse of democratization `` fundamentally at variance with the aims of perestroika.'' Giving in to nationalist demands, he told the Presidium, would `` poison public mentality with nationalist venom and thereby spoil relations between the peoples for many, many years to come.'' In unanimously rejecting <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s attempt to secede against <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, the Presidium warned that a series of strikes that began in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and spread to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, crippling the local economy, had exhausted the Presidium's patience. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> authorized police to `` take essential measures'' to end the strikes and `` activities directed at kindling national strife and attempts to misuse democratic rights for anti-democratic purposes.'' Troops stationed in the strife-torn areas were reinforced. <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, a leader of the annexation drive who was arrested in March on a charge of defaming the state, was stripped of his Soviet citizenship and ordered expelled from the country. The state-run national press attacked strike leaders by name. First indications showed the new tough tactics were having an impact. Most workers in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> returned to their jobs, although the general strike continued in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The central leadership clearly has acted with more restraint and tolerance than would have been expected in previous Soviet regimes. Not long ago, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would have quickly turned to force to put down the turmoil. This time, the Kremlin first tried the power of persuasion. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made a personal appeal Feb. 26 for `` civic maturity and restraint,'' and the mass demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> subsided. But two days later, a riot broke out in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, and at least 32 people were killed, 26 of them Armenians. The <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> also tried changing the local leadership, installing new party chiefs in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The new officials quickly acknowledged that Armenians in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> had been deprived culturally and socially under previous regimes. In March, the central government announced a major remedial program to improve cultural and social conditions in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, with much of the aid going to the Armenian majority. But Armenians outside the region, perhaps encouraged by the new latitude given them by glasnost, made annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> a crusade. Those who died in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> were its martyrs. The legislatures of both <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and the Armenian republic sought the annexation, claiming the right of self-determination guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution. But <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, citing another constitutional provision requiring consent of affected republics before redrawing boundaries, rejected the appeals. That set the stage for intervention by the central government. `` Democratic rights and the new conditions opened up and created by perestroika are being clearly misused for anti-democratic purposes,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Presidium. Both sides, he said, were using territorial claims to stir up national sentiments and `` conceal the really difficult, crying problems that had accumulated.'' Victory can only come by finding a common course, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, adding that the search for that course must continue.

<HEAD>New Corn Plant Could Help Third World</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new plant that could turn corn into a health food and help nourish protein-starved children in the Third World is being promoted by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. It's called QPM for quality-protein maize because it contains about twice the usable protein of ordinary varieties. Maize is the international word for corn. A small research team, working for 10 years, developed QPM at the same laboratories where Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borlaug </PERSON> produced the new wheat varieties that brought the `` green revolution'' in the 1950s. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vietmeyer </PERSON>, an expert on useful but neglected plants for the research council, calls <PERSON> Borlaug </PERSON>, 74, the `` spiritual godfather'' of QPM, although he was not directly involved in the project at the International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat near <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borlaug </PERSON> still works at the center. `` Maize is often the crop of the poor, and in the maize-growing areas of the world, millions of children living in poverty are not thriving,'' says the newly published report of a panel appointed by the council. `` Here is an opportunity to explore this new approach to relieving an intolerable situation,'' it says. The world produces enough corn to provide each inhabitant with about 200 pounds a year. It is a staple food for nearly half the world's chronically undernourished people. `` A typical diet might consist of 20 or more tortillas a day, supplemented with hot peppers, some native greens, and little or nothing else,'' says the council's monthly `` News Report'' for July. Tortillas are generally made in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with corn meal. People in wealthier countries get their protein from meat, fish, cheese and a variety of other foods. Small children get it from milk. Tens of millions of poor people in the Third World survive on corn, cassava, yams, plantain and other foods low in protein. When small children are weaned in those countries, they can not eat enough of the beans or rice to provide the protein milk has given them, and millions suffer from kwashiorkor, a protein-deficiency disease that stunts growth. The report suggests distributing QPM in areas that already depend heavily on corn to feed small children: the highlands of the Andes mountains in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. It sees QPM as also having important advantages for industrial countries. `` There is, for instance, distinct promise for breakfast cereals and snack foods, both of which are constantly criticized for their low nutritional value,'' it says. The new maize variety is not yet ready for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, It was created with the Third World in mind and its pollen is spread naturally by the wind. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, farmers use hybrid seeds produced in greenhouses or on special plots of land, so that the seeds always breed true. One of the problems with QPM is that it looks and tastes like ordinary corn, and so do the gruels, cakes and tortillas made from it. This makes it more palatable than some earlier varieties but there is a danger that a field of QPM might interbreed with a field of ordinary maize and the QPM would soon lose its special quality. The report says that for this reason it will be especially important to introduce QPM in an organized way.

 <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Filemyr </PERSON>'s health is frail and money is tight, so when the government suddenly slashed her share of her ex-husband's military pension, she had to plead with doctors and creditors to accept less than usual when bills came due. The 66-year-old <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> woman says her main source of income was cut without warning in May, from about $ 1,100 a month to $ 900, and she's spent the last two months trying to find out why. She thinks the cut came because her es-husband, a retired colonel, may have incurred a debt to the government many years after their 1972 divorce. The military wo n't say more, she said, because it would be an invasion of his privacy. `` My credit rating is being hurt; I have to call my creditors and say my check is reduced and I do n't know why and I ca n't pay you,'' Ms. <PERSON> Filemyr </PERSON> said. Congressional officials and members of an ex-wives support group in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, say Ms. <PERSON> Filemyr </PERSON>'s case is not unique and may illustrate a growing trend as the government cracks down on its bad debts. `` The government _ they'll get their money any way they can,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, former president of EX-POSE, or Ex-Partners of Servicemen-women for Equality. `` We've heard from quite a few -LRB- women -RRB- and it's quite devastating. They do n't even know why it's being reduced and the finance centers wo n't tell them. They only know the man's gone into debt for something,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. She said representatives of the group met with <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials earlier this month to argue that the ex-wives should not be held liable for debts incurred by their former spouses after the divorce is final. But the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> told the group `` chances of an administrative change are very slim,'' she said. Congressional hearings on the matter and other related issues are planned in September before a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, says a spokeswoman for Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., who sponsored the 1982 Former Spouse Protection Act Under the bill, courts can award a portion of a serviceman's retirement check to the former spouse If the couple were married at least 10 years, the ex-wife can receive the money directly through the military's finance centers, Ms. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. Maj. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Super </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the military is looking into the situation but continues to `` operate with existing administrative rules and laws.'' Ms. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said her organization plans to poll its 3,500 members about the problem this month. `` This is not an isolated case,'' Ms. <PERSON> Filemyr </PERSON> wrote in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` I have spoken with various women across the country who have related to me that they are in the same situation.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Filemyr </PERSON> said she was divorced after 25 years of marriage and was on welfare for years as she fought for the 1982 law. `` I only had a little job here, a little job there, and I kept getting sicker,'' she said. `` I've had it rough, yes I've had it rough. Her only other source of income is a monthly Social Security check of about $ 160, she said. Rep. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>'s spokeswoman said the congresswoman plans to introduce legislation that would divide retirement pay according to a formula based on the number of years of service and the length of the marriage, rather than leaving the decision to individual courts or states.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Confident Of Vote-Getting Strength For Dukakis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Booe, graf 7, cq</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Bolstered by their highest delegate strength ever at a Democratic convention, union leaders believe they can deliver 2.5 million votes for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in November. Although the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> will not officially endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> until Aug. 24, after the Republican convention, its political operatives left here with no intention of waiting for what one called the `` pro forma announcement'' to begin working on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' behalf. An $ 8 million voter registration campaign _ put on a back burner while unions concentrated on collecting convention delegates in the primaries and caucuses _ is being reignited this week. After breakfasting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last week, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said in an interview that unions will have less difficulty than they did four years ago in getting their members to vote a Democratic ticket. `` In 1984 there was a swell of support in favor of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' he said. `` We stemmed that tide better than the others. This year there is an entirely different set of circumstances. There's no incumbency and people want a change.'' Despite the union label on 1,054 or more than one-fourth of the Democratic convention delegates, labor still is maintaining a lower profile in comparison with its all-out boosterism of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> four years ago. `` We worked harder in 1984 and all we got for it was fewer delegates and more abuse,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Booe </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. It was two of labor's more consistent supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> _ who cried `` special interest'' after the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> endorsed <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in October 1983. That was four months before the first <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> takes satisfaction that both <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> `` went down the chute'' afterwards and that no candidate for national office has repeated what he views as a slur since. But the scar is still there. To provide <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a winning margin, labor leaders believe they will have to get at least a 65 percent vote for him from a rank-and-file membership that cast 39 percent of its votes four years ago for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` There is a mythology that it was the blue-collar workers that brought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in,'' said <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>. `` Sixty percent of our people voted for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. But if we have to get two-thirds of our membership, which encompasses a wide cross-section of the country, to elect a decent candidate, it tells me there is a strong conservative bias in the rest of the population.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> plans to have at least 300,000 volunteers working the polls on Election Day, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, director of the federation's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. But first it has to ensure that its members are registered. Labor political activists are working on a three-part formula that could allow unions to provide enough votes to counter the acknowledged more conservative views of the rest of the electorate. It calls for: _ Voter registration that is 15 percentage points above the national average of 72 percent. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate that about 80 percent of the federation's 14.1 million members are now registered. _ Turnout on election day that is 15 percentage points higher than the 53 percent of the voting age population that went to the polls in 1984. _ And a vote among union members for the labor-endorsed candidate that is at least 15 percentage points higher than the electorate at large gives him. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> achieved that in 1984 with the 61 percent of its membership voting for <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, compared with 41 percent of the total electorate. With all three, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> estimates trade union support of a candidate is worth a net 2.5 million votes nationwide. `` That's not something to be sneezed at,'' he says with pride. According to political directors for individual unions, the effort faltered last time on making sure members were registered and getting them to the polls on election day. Even though <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> had an early lock on the labor endorsement, many believed he could not win and support waned, according to one labor activist. What's different this year is a belief among labor activists that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has so many negatives that a strong union turnout could provide <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with the edge to beat him. `` Our rank and file by a slim margin voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, the Communication Workers' political director. `` But they've indicated overwhelmingly they will come back to the Democratic side. If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were a warm individual, the fact he has been a supporter of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would help him. But our members think he's arrogant and a snob.''

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, once the bitterest of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rivals, is showing an increasingly benign attitude toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, raising the possibility of an eventual accommodation. For the short term, however, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is refusing even to discuss the differences between the two countries, preferring to await a total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> before making overtures of its own. The administration also wants a full accounting from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen still listed as missing 15 years after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pullout from that country. For some time, the U.S.-Vietnamese dialogue has been limited exclusively to humanitarian issues. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, is showing a new face to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in large and small ways. This past week, three <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fliers picked up by a Vietnamese ship in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> after ditching their plane had nothing but praise for their rescuers. They were well treated and were returned quickly to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody. On similar occasions in the past, rescued <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen were confined for months in difficult conditions by Vietnamese authorities, who sometimes demanded up to $ 20,000 for their release. There are other examples of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s more forthcoming attitude: _ A week ago, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> announced that it will allow more than 50,000 persons, many identified with the U.S.-backed <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> government that was toppled by <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s forces in 1975, to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Most served time in re-education camps known for their unhospitable environment. _ On Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese technical experts will meet in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to discuss joint on-site investigations to help resolve the fate of the nearly 2,400 American servicemen still unaccounted for from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was pleased with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s promise of a `` concerted effort'' to resolve this issue. _ <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> also has been allowing Vietnamese children fathered by American servicemen to emigrate with their families to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> A group of 78 left earlier this month, bringing the total to more than 11,000. Still, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has shown no interest in opening talks on normalizing relations, preferring to keep economic and diplomatic pressure on <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. `` When you have a strategy that's working, you do n't abandon it just when it's beginning to succeed,'' a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. This official and others, insisting on anonymity, said they believe that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is feeling the pressure of a declining economy and the international isolation it has suffered as a result of its continued military presence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. While many other Asian nations are enjoying an economic boom, partially the result of large-scale exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ranks among the world's poorest nations, with no access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets because of a trade embargo. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, resolutions condemning the Vietnamese role in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> consistently have been approved by overwhelming margins. Among major countries, only <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has recognized the pro-Hanoi government which has been in power in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1979. Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including conservatives, believe the time has come for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reciprocate the Vietnamese gestures. On Thursday, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, urged the administration `` to think seriously about its policy in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' a sentiment shared by Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R-S. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., and Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., have called on the administration to exchange small diplomatic missions with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and Both are former prisoners of war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. All this has fallen on deaf ears in the administration. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said last week the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will `` unequivocally welcome'' normal relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> only when there is an acceptable <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> settlement and a satisfactory accounting of the missing American servicmen. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to these two goals is `` unshakeable.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> seems eager for a pullout from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, recently announcing plans to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and agreeing to take part in preliminary peace talks involving rival Cambodian factions and other Asian nations. Those talks will start Monday in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON>, said in an interview published last week that a Vietnamese withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will be completed in 1990 even if there is no political solution reached between the Cambodian government and three rebel groups.

<TEXT>
 Ex-Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says Democrats will be disappointed if they are hoping for friction at the Republican National Convention between his supporters and backers of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We got what we wanted,'' <PERSON> Roberson </PERSON> said. `` I like the 1984 platform, and we're in agreement to stick with it.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who pledged to campaign on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf, attended a Unity'88 Republican rally Saturday in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> along with Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Secretary of the Interior <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>. The television evangelist said Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the `` most liberal candidate any party has nominated for the presidency,'' and called the Democratic convention a `` carefully crafted charade to make liberal Democrats look like moderate Republicans.'' <PERSON> Roberston </PERSON> also said there would be no floor fights on platform issues at the GOP convention next month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. However, he did say he would like a plank calling for the nomination of conservative candidates at all levels of the federal judiciary. `` We want judges who will interpret the Constitution as the law of the land,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` not rewrite the Constitution as the law of the land.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> urged his followers to get behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, predicting they could provide the margin of victory in as many as 20 closely contested states.

<TEXT>
 Bloodshot eyes, a hoarse voice and a weary demeanor are hallmarks of <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s profession, a result of working 15 hours or more at a time in the acrid smoke and intense heat of forest fires. Injury or death are possible. The pay is marginal, an average of about $ 8 an hour. Except for an occasional good meal, the only benefit may be a shower after a shift. For more than a week now, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has led crews battling the <ORGANIZATION> Mink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> fire, which by Sunday had blackened 22,650 acres in the Teton Wilderness of the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> 40 miles northeast of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's just so dry,'' incident commander <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said Friday. `` We just have to have some rain. But our weather people say there's nothing in the forecast for at least 10 days, and we're also facing the prospect of some dry lightning strikes in the next few days. Wind gusting to 35 mph and humidity as low as 11 percent have exacerbated the dry conditions. The main thrust of efforts by firefighters _ as many as 830 but down to 737 Sunday _ has been to prevent the fire from spreading south, where it could threaten homes and dude ranches in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The firefighters' line across the southern end was holding Sunday, but the north end had burned about a quarter of a mile into Yellowstone National Park. Officials said it was in a remote area more than 30 miles from any major park attractions, but other fires burned inside the park. The southern edge of the huge blaze was about five miles from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, but in between is an area of `` blowdown'' trees, piles of tinder-dry wood left by a tornado last year. `` We're holding on at the south end, and every day we do that is a real positive,'' said <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>. The lightning-caused blaze broke out July 11 and because it is in a wilderness area, officials are required by law to allow it to burn its natural course as much as possible. Such blazes are usually allowed to burn until they threaten human life or private property. In the long run, officials say, wildlife benefits. With the threat to residents south of the fire, crews have taken a more active role. However, they are restricted in their digging and cutting, and the use of bulldozers and mechanical tools such as chain saws is discouraged. All work must be done by air or on foot; there is no vehicle access. The cost of fighting the blaze was just over $ 2 million Sunday, forestry officials said. `` Any wilderness fire is more difficult to fight because of its remoteness,'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who has been fighting fires since 1968. `` The constraints make it even harder.'' In addition to digging fire lines, crews deployed 20 miles of hose to draw water from lakes and ponds. They also burned 2,000 acres to create a fire break on the southern edge. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 39, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> range conservationist from <LOCATION> Vale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said some firefighters have experienced knee and leg problems because of the steep terrain. But morale, he said, `` has been fantastic. These teams have a lot of pride.'' For the past few days, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has been leader of a group of <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> Indian firefighters from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. That crew just arrived from battling another blaze in Lame Deer, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. The base camp has facilities for eating, sleeping, caring for the injured and organizing the firefighting. Officials pore over maps and infrared photographs of the fire area. Health and safety officials monitor fatigue among crews, shipping some out for a rest and demobilizing others entirely, bringing in fresh crews to replace them. A fresh crew could expect to stay on the scene as long as 21 days. `` I'll be here that long if my legs hold out,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Reform Package Would Give Local Schools Autonomy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The school system branded the worst in the nation could become a trailblazer under a reform package that calls for a slimmed-down bureaucracy and more neighborhood clout. The proposal calls for a council at each of the city's 594 schools to create a three-year improvement plan. If the called-for changes are n't made, the council may fire the principal. The councils will consist of 11 members _ parents, teachers, community residents and the principal. Decentralization of power in public schools is a national trend, but no district has given schools the kind of autonomy outlined in this package, authorities say. `` Even though it's been talked about a few times in the country, I think if <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> goes ahead, it will be a unique step,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pipho </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the States, a Denver-based non-profit group that monitors school legislation. The reform bill for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s beleaguered schools was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> this spring and awaits Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s signature <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> must decide by September but has not indicated which way he's leaning. If he signs, it will take effect next July. Critics say the measure focuses too much on administrative reorganization and too little on programs to help boost performance of the 430,000 students in the nation's third-largest school district. Even supporters say that if the measure accomplishes all that's intended, it wo n't cure deep-seated ills like the growing numbers of low-income students, a double-digit dropout rate and teen-age pregnancy `` We'd be kidding ourselves to think that simply doing this is going to do all those other things that affect learning,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakalis </PERSON>, dean of the education school at <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the state's former education superintendent. But <PERSON> Bakalis </PERSON>, who co-chaired a coalition of community groups that fought to reform <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> schools, called the package `` a first step'' toward eliminating problems that have given the system a national reputation for mediocrity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who last year labeled <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> schools the nation's worst, has not yet studied the package and is `` inclined not to comment until enough time has passed'' to assess the results, said a spokesman, <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The schools' problems stem largely from poorly trained teachers and administrators ill-equipped to handle the 70 percent of the student population from poor homes, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenhiemer </PERSON>, executive director of the pro-reform group <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact is that children bring many more problems to school than they used to _ health problems, language deficiencies, just coming to school without the same kind of nurturing at home that they had when it was a typical two-parent family situation ... where children were talked to, where parents were very much involved,'' he said Friday. He said the reform measure will help by permitting speedier removal of unsatisfactory personnel. Also under the bill, a teacher could be dismissed after 45 days for unsatisfactory performance, <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. Teachers now found to be doing a poor job by the principal and a consulting teacher are given a year to improve. However, the measure does not provide additional money for retraining teachers or administrators, Oppenheimer noted. `` It's fine to get rid of lousy teachers But it's better to retrain ... and teacher retraining takes money,'' he said. The package also would allow principals to hire teachers on merit, without regard for seniority, reduce administrative spending and staff at the city <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and create a board to oversee the changes. Many have mixed feelings about the degree of parental involvement called for in the package. `` I do n't feel that parents will have the time or the know-how, nor the interest, to become that involved,'' said <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, who heads a pro-reform group called Concerned Parents Network. `` I am a very active parent ... and I know how difficult it is to get parents involved,'' she said. The school board and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have declined to endorse or reject the proposal. `` The entire bill is under review'' by the board's legal department, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotsakis </PERSON>, assistant to <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, the union president, declined comment. `` We have n't seen the final and actual language,'' he said.

 The newest <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> candidate is Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s youngest son, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, and he's going after a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> although he's just a 21-year-old college student. The 49-year-old Democrat who's held the job for 10 years resents it, and some key state Democrats say <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is just practicing before he runs for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He has to be 25 before he can serve there, however. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a small, private school in the state's capital, is challenging Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeffington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for a part-time, two-year legislative post. `` I'm so surprised,'' said <PERSON> Skeffington </PERSON>, adding that he was an acquaintance of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family. `` I just did n't think they would come in and run against an incumbent.'' `` I am not opposed to <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' said City Councilwoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brassil </PERSON>, the city Democratic chairwoman. `` I just feel that a student in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> should n't come into the state and run.'' `` I get the impression that he's using this as a stepping stone to a congressional seat,'' said <PERSON> Brassil </PERSON>. The Democratic primary in September includes a third candidate, city employee <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitassi </PERSON>. The winner will be unopposed in the November election because no Republican filed for the seat. <PERSON> Skeffington </PERSON> had a difficult primary in 1986 and won renomination by only 185 votes against a 22-year-old political newcomer. The district has more than 4,900 registered voters. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the examples of his uncle, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and his father, who won his <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in 1962, inspired him to get into politics. `` I've been given a name, and I think there's a certain responsibility that goes hand-in-hand with that name,'' he said. `` It would be easier to sit back and enjoy all the things I've been given. But I'm going to be spending my summer walking door-to-door.'' <PERSON> Skeffington </PERSON> questions the young candidate's commitment to the neighborhood after he graduates in two years, and calls attention to his family's wealth. `` I know that <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> has said on a radio talk show that he will spend as much as it takes,'' he said. `` I do n't have those kind of funds. ... I'm going to run on my record.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spent $ 12,000 in the March primary to win election as a <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate to last week's Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Skeffington </PERSON> frequently uses the word `` they,'' meaning the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> clan, when referring to his opponent, which <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> dislikes. `` People have said that the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedys </ORGANIZATION> have come in to take over,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` That's no such thing. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is running for state rep.'' The newest <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> candidate faces several obstacles _ his age, his relatively short residency and his name. He shares an apartment in a frame house in the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> district a few blocks from campus. He's an outsider in the ethnic, blue-collar neighborhood, and a wealthy one at that. Despite his wealth, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says, his neighbors showered him with cards and expressions of sympathy when he was hospitalized last spring to have a benign tumor removed from his back. <PERSON> Skeffington </PERSON> runs a funeral home that his grandfather opened after coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1907. `` I am a Mount Pleasanter,'' said <PERSON> Skeffington </PERSON>, who turns 50 on Aug. 11. `` The people of my district are people like me. ... We're working-class people We -LRB- politicians -RRB- try to do a good job for our constituents, and I feel I do a good job for them. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he watched <PERSON> Skeffington </PERSON> while working as a Statehouse page and legislative researcher his first year at college. `` I saw someone who has had a chance to do more for the community but has n't done so,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think an incumbent has a divine right to the office he holds just because he's an incumbent.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is the latest of a new generation of <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON> to take a shot at politics. His brother, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and sister, <PERSON> Kara </PERSON>, are running their father's re-election campaign in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. His cousin, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, son of the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, is a congressman from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, the oldest daughter of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, made an unsuccessful congressional bid in 1986.

 <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> battlefield offensives during <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire efforts are aimed at strengthening <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s position in peace talks and achieving a permanent solution to complicated problems, according to officials and diplomats here. While <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced last week that it would accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution, Iraqis say they hope to forge a lasting peace with their longstanding rival to the east. A cease-fire alone might pave the way for further talks, Iraqis and diplomats say, but it would not solve major and often enduring disputes between the two sides. These include <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s support of Kurdish rebels in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s backing of Iranian rebels along the border, a disputed strip of land, and arguments over borders and navigation in the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main outlet to the sea, that date back centuries. `` For the international community, the important thing is to cease hostilities,'' a Western diplomat said. `` For this country, the important thing is to find peace. These are two completely different aspects.'' He said it could take `` months if not years'' to achieve a final peace settlement. `` We do n't want a situation where we get into a worse war in a couple of years,'' a senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official told reporters over the weekend. The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official, who also demanded anonymity, indicated his country would not rush into any settlement. `` We have lived with it -LRB- war -RRB- for eight years. If it takes eight more weeks, no problem,'' he said. He said the need for serious peace talks was behind <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has balked at the proposal. On the heels of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s cease-fire decision, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched sizeable offensives that it said drove the last remaining Iranian forces from its territory. It pushed several miles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced that more than 8,500 Iranians were taken captive. A military communique, which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said was drafted by President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, said the attacks were aimed at paving the way for peace by reclaiming all Iraqi territory and taking captives, apparently to even the numbers that will have to be exchanged after the war. Communiques also said the attacks were aimed at smashing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s already reeling war machine Despite Iranian claims the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> invasion reached nearly 40 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the Iraqi troops appeared to have withdrawn to their own borders within hours after their forays into Iranian territory. After the war, a rebuilt <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will pose a continuing challenge to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has a third of its neighbor's population. The two countries clashed diplomatically and militarily during the rule of <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, which preceded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution Under a 1975 pact, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to stop financing Kurdish rebels who posed a serious problem for the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government and to guarantee free navigation along the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON>, which leads to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s September 1980 invasion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> followed Iranian shelling of Iraqi towns and a declaration to close the Shatt. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> renounced the 1975 agreement, claiming <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> already had done so, but <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials continue to refer to the pact as a basis for their claims to a strip along the central border. The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s acceptance of a cease-fire has destroyed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s dream of spreading its version of Islam throughout the region. `` This is a watershed between two eras,'' he said. It means <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has `` accepted the notion of coexisting with a secular regime'' and accepted political boundaries, he said. `` By accepting that in a legal and political sense, it will be the end of a model,'' he said, referring to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s hopes of exporting its revolution.

 The barns of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> are part of its history, say preservationists critical of companies that are dismantling the familiar structures, moving them and reassembling the frames for upscale housing. The barn movers say the barns are dilapidated victims of neglect, and finding other uses is better than losing them completely. `` Even if it goes out-of-state, people will see what an old barn was,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Epworth </PERSON>, a founder of <ORGANIZATION> Barn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodstock </ORGANIZATION>, which has been dismantling barns for more than a decade. `` You ca n't see it if it's disappeared.'' But preservationists like <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbertson </PERSON> say every barn that's torn down makes it more difficult to identify <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s agricultural `` Every state developed differently, and you can read a state by looking at its old buildings,'' said <PERSON> Gilbertson </PERSON>, director of the state's division for historic preservation. `` How do you recognize a place that was a farm if the barns are gone?'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vissor </PERSON>, a professor with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION>'s historic preservation program, said pre-Civil War barns, known as <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> barns, face the greatest threat They are likely to be of sought-after post and beam construction with hand-hewn beams, and often 30 feet by 40 feet, a good size for a house. The Yankee barns are characterized by a shallow pitch roof, vertical planking on the outside, a large, hinged door on the long side and three bays inside. `` If they were houses, we would certainly recognize them as being historic,'' <PERSON> Vissor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Epworth </PERSON> agreed that <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> is losing its barns but said dismantlers are n't to blame. `` More than any other factor, it's deterioration,'' he said `` Farmers are n't using them.'' <PERSON> Epworth </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, began by taking down old houses for scrap, then barns. In the mid-1970s, as the old post and beam architecture became popular again, they began using the frames for new buildings. Most of their barns come from near <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. About a quarter of the barns remain in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, with the rest going out of state. People who buy the barns are looking for a piece of history and architectural relics that ca n't be found among the staples and plywood of the modern building industry, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, a partner in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Historic Frames and Barns, which has dismantled six barns in the last year. `` There's a gut love for the old buildings because they are not made any more,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>. `` It's like being in church for some people. It's a feeling, you just ca n't put you finger on it.'' It may be the wide beams of a single tree rippled slightly by the ax blade, raised to the roof without a crane and hitched to the rafters by tree nails, or wooden pegs. `` Once you see one, you fall in love,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> insisted. In recent years, <PERSON> Epworth </PERSON> said, the market for slate roofing has fueled the loss of barns because someone taking only the slate and burning or bulldozing the rest can work much faster than someone who plans to use the frame, each piece of which must be marked for reassembly. `` The buildings we're taking down are all dilapidated,'' he said. `` We wo n't take down a perfectly good structure.'' Nationwide, barns have been threatened by changing agricultural practices. In response, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> last year sponsored a contest on remodeling old barns for modern uses. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Humstone </PERSON>, director of the Denver-based Barn Again program, said the 500 entries showed many economically feasible ways for farmers to continue using their barns rather than replacing them.

 A partially deaf boy found wandering the streets more than eight months ago traveled 700 miles across <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to escape a life of erratic meals and begging, welfare officials say. `` He was off looking for a life of his own,'' said <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hogar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nino </ORGANIZATION>, a government-run home here where 9-year-old <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON> now lives. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>, one of five children of a poverty-stricken family, ran away in October from his one-room house in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. His father lives in another city and does n't support the family, and investigations show the child often was sent out to beg for money, authorities said. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> was found Nov. 7 wandering the streets of <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, about 700 miles from <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, and was taken to a government welfare agency there. `` We do n't know how he got there, but this child knows how to handle himself,'' Ms. <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said last week. Officials in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> and across the border in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, spent eight months trying to learn <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>'s identity. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>, who was called <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> until his mother identified him, is unable to write and only mumbles a few words. He communicates mostly through gestures or pictures. But officials here say he's an intelligent child who only lacks proper schooling. Many of the pictures the boy drew in Ciudad Juarez depicted an airplane in flames, leading authorities to speculate that he might have survived a plane crash. Specialists now say those pictures reveal a very active imagination fueled by television and the fact that his home in <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION> is next to an airport. Authorities say <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> left home because he knew the world had more to offer than a tiny house, erratic meals and days spent begging on the street. `` He's very savvy. And he's quite courageous because he went out into the world knowing that it was n't going to be easy,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON>, a welfare official in <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>, the northeastern border state where both <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> are located. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Micaela </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON>, claimed him in late June and took him home. But she works long hours in a bar and is unable to properly care for the child, said Ms. <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>'s oldest sister, a 13-year-old, takes care of the youngest children most of the time. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> now lives with 109 other children at <LOCATION> Casa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hogar </LOCATION>, a children's home here run by DIF, the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> acronym for Integrated Family Development. The home, one of four in the state and dozens throughout the country, provides food, clothing, complimentary education and love to children who have been abandoned or whose family is unable to provide a decent upbringing. The children in the home range in age from less than a year to 15. About 40 percent of them have been abandoned, said Ms. <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> now lives in a huge, clean dormitory with about two dozen other boys in his age group. He is spending his summer taking classes in art, swimming and dancing, all of them provided by the government. In the fall, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> will attend school for the first time, a special education program where he'll learn to use sign language and, perhaps, to speak. `` He's definitely an intelligent child. What he ca n't say in words he makes up for with signals,'' said psychologist <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrel </PERSON>. The other children do n't seem to struggle to understand <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> as he pokes and points and pantomimes to make himself understood. Although <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> has been at the home just a couple of weeks, he already has established himself as a leader. When the boys get together to play soccer, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> is the one who comes out of the dormitory carrying the ball. When the children line up for lunch at the cafeteria, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> shows a late arrival where he should stand. Yet authorities say they're keeping a watchful eye on the exit. They say <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> is just the kind of boy to round up a few friends and take off. `` He's used to taking care of himself, so he has a few problems with rules,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ferrel </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Burmese Leader to be Replaced Soon, Party Discusses Economic
Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A special congress of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ruling party is considering drastic economic changes and may sweep away the rigid policies of former leader Ne Win when it chooses his successor, official sources said Sunday. The sources, who refused to be identified further, said the changes being contemplated by the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> include lifting barriers to private foreign investment for the first time since Ne Win seized power in 1962. The 77-year-old Ne Win announced his resignation Saturday as party chairman, citing his age and indirect responsibility for bloody anti-government rioting in March and June. By party rules, action must taken to replace Ne Win by Monday, the final day of the three-day congress, which is being held behind closed doors. Five other top leaders, including <PERSON> Burmas </PERSON>'s president and vice president _ positions less powerful than the party chairman's _ offered their resignations Saturday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON>, the most senior member of the party's 17-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who has not resigned, was seen as a likely replacement for Ne Win. Like all members of the government and party, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON> has been overshadowed by Ne Win since assuming his post in 1977. The 68-year-old former army officer is generally not regarded as a forceful or imaginative leader. At the congress' opening session Saturday, Ne Win called for a popular referendum on one-party rule in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. In an announcement believed connected to the referendum, state radio said Sunday an emergency parliament session would convene Wednesday. Under Burmese law, only the parliament can carry out referendums. The emergency parliament session also could deal with the appointment of new government leaders. Sources at the party congress said proposals being discussed by the more than 1,000 delegates included an almost wholesale pullout of the government from economic sectors it once tried to manage with disastrous results. These include agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining, heavy industry, trade and transportation. The sources said the proposals also include joint ventures between private domestic and private foreign investors, which Ne Win steadfastly opposed. If the proposals pass, the state monopoly on both foreign and domestic trade would end and the vast and currently illegal cross-border trade with neighboring countries would be legalized. News of both the possible economic changes and the resignation of Ne Win has spread quickly through this capital of 3.5 million. But public expression of opinion was minimal. `` They -LRB- the government -RRB- are responsible for our poverty,'' said one pavement hawker Sunday, echoing a sentiment heard among small-scale dealers in city markets. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, potentially one of the region's most prosperous nations due to an abundance of natural resources, sank under Ne Win's leadership to one of the world's 10 poorest nations It has an annual per capita income of less than $ 200. Since October, student-led demonstrations have three times rocked <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> cities, resulting in deaths, mass arrests and the closure of universities. The October demonstrations were sparked when the government withdrew several currency notes from circulation without compensation. More than 100 persons died in rioting in March and June, according to Western diplomats.

 This year's college graduates received higher salary offers than last year's graduates, especially in business fields, but the number of job offers declined slightly, according to a survey released Sunday. The largest increase was in accounting, with graduates receiving salary offers 10.9 percent higher than last year. The average monthly offer rose from $ 1,812 to $ 2,010, for an average yearly salary of $ 24,120. Job offers in accounting were down slightly from 5,478 to 5,264, according to a <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Placement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> survey released Sunday. The data included offers made to students graduating between Sept. 1, 1987, and Aug. 31, 1988. Placement offices at 154 colleges and universities participated in the survey. Acceptances were not reported because August graduations were included. In business administration, the average salary offer rose 4.1 percent from $ 1,701 to $ 1,772, or $ 21,264 a year, but offers fell from 1,788 to 1,285, the survey said. In banking, salary offers dropped 3.9 percent from $ 1,889 to $ 1,815, or $ 21,780 a year, but the number of jobs increased from 395 to 527. Non-technical graduates received 48 percent of the job offers made to graduates with bachelor's degrees, while technical graduates received 52 percent of the offers. For non-technical graduates, 40 percent of the job offers came from public accounting employers, while the electrical and electronic machinery and equipment industry provided 16 percent of the job offers to technical graduates. The average monthly salary offered to non-technical graduates was $ 2,045, or $ 24,540 a year, according to the survey. Technical graduates averaged monthly offers of $ 2,465, or $ 29,580. For master's of business administration candidates with non-technical undergraduate degrees, starting offers increased 5 percent to $ 2,791, or $ 33,492 annually. Inexperienced MBA candidates with technical undergraduate degrees attracted offers of $ 3,192, or $ 38,304, an 11.8 percent rise. Technical and non-technical MBA graduates with previous experience garnered increased salary offers between 4 percent and 16 percent, the survey said. The engineering field provided 42 percent of the job offers to graduates with bachelor's degrees and was followed by business with 40 percent, sciences at 10 percent, humanities and social sciences at 6 percent and communications at 2 percent. However, for master's degree candidates, business disciplines made 52 percent of the offers; engineering, 36 percent; sciences, 8 percent; and humanities and social sciences, 4 percent. The survey reported men received slightly higher salary offers in business administration, marketing and distribution, economics and several science disciplines. Women received slightly higher offers in engineering.

<HEAD>Mounted Police Deployed Against Growing Gaggle of Geese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STONEHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police on horseback have been forced to conduct daily <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> geese roundups because of a multiplying gaggle that is stopping traffic, munching parched lawns and, er, making people more careful where they step. `` The droppings are awesome,'' town administrator <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Everywhere the geese go the droppings follow.'' Since <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> geese are a protected species, it is illegal to kill them. Residents shoo them off their lawns with brooms and honk their car horns to get them out of the streets. `` They stop here in the course of their migration and people feed them, so they stay instead of moving on,'' said officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>. `` At first people liked it, but now we're getting a lot of complaints.'' <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Stoneham </LOCATION>, a town of 23,000 about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, is known as a bedroom community, but the geese are keeping residents awake at night with their honking. The flock also has raised the bacteria count at Spot Pond Reservoir, which supplies drinking water for <LOCATION> Stoneham </LOCATION> and neighboring towns. `` That's the main problem,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION>. `` The more they multiply, the more excretions go in our water.'' Town officials say the goose population has grown from a handful when the birds arrived 10 years ago to about 650 birds, and the flock is growing daily. Until recently, residents said, the geese usually stayed on a patch of grass just north of a reservoir. But when hot weather parched grass in late June and early July, the geese began searching for greener pastures. `` They eat the grass in one place, and when there's no more, they move down the street a little further,'' said <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>. As they forage, the geese have been stopping traffic at the intersection of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> and Route 28, one of the town's busiest arteries The problem became so acute last week that <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> and other officers mounted horses around noon every day to herd the geese back across the street. In one yard, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said, `` It was just black with geese. You could n't see the lawn.'' <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who lives near the reservoir, said she knows it's illegal to kill the geese, but she can still hope. While sweeping them off her lawn last week she said, `` I was hoping several of them would get hit by a car.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the reservoir, said the <ORGANIZATION> MDC </ORGANIZATION> plans to put up a snow fence to keep the birds off the street. But the best long-term solution, he said, would be for residents and visitors simply to stop feeding the geese. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> has other ideas. `` I think they should save four or five of them and get rid of the rest. Ship them north,'' he said, adding, `` I hear they make good eating.''

<HEAD>Moslem Pilgrims Sacrifice Sheep As Hajj Draws to Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Moslems on the annual pilgrimage to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrines Sunday ritually slaughtered sheep on a plain in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to commemorate <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s offer to sacrifice his son to God. The ritual marked the end of the hajj, or pilgrimage, and the start of the four-day Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, which is observed by about 850 million Moslems worldwide. More than 1 million Moslems _ including about 1,000 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ came to sacrifice sheep on the same plains outside <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> where, according to tradition, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> offered to sacrifice his son He substituted a sheep at the last minute when <PERSON> God </PERSON> ordered him to stop the human sacrifice, tradition says. The ritual sheep sacrifice followed a series of religious rites that began Friday with prayers at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>'s Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest shrine Later that day, the crowds moved to the plains of <LOCATION> Mina </LOCATION>, where they spent the night. For the climax of the hajj Saturday, the pilgrims climbed <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arafat </LOCATION>, about nine miles outside <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, where they prayed, listened to sermons and chanted. Before dawn Sunday, they returned to the plains of <LOCATION> Mina </LOCATION>, where they stoned the devil by casting seven pebbles at three pillars to reject evil, or Satan. The act recalls <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s stoning of the devil to avoid being tempted into disobeying God's command to sacrifice his son. Saudi authorities have built special slaughterhouses, where the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> killed the 600,000 sheep _ at a cost of $ 75 each _ for pilgrims who did n't want to do it themselves. The meat is to be distributed to the poor in Moslem countries. Some pilgrims will return to <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> on Monday and Tuesday to stone the devil again. Others will proceed to the holy city of <PERSON> Madina </PERSON> to visit the tomb and mosque of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. All Moslems are expected to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once, if they can afford it. King Fahd, the official custodian of the holy shrines, and Crown Prince <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Mina </LOCATION> on Saturday to supervise the final stages of the hajj. The hajj is being observed under tight security this year to avoid a repetition of last year's rioting that left 402 people dead, most of them Iranian pilgrims. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed Saudi authorities opened fire on the pilgrims, but <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> officials said most of the deaths occurred during stampedes after Iranians held anti-U.S. and anti-Saudi demonstrations. The Iranians boycotted this year's hajj after <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> authorities announced they would restrict the number of pilgrims who could come to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Information Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Shaer </PERSON> announced the ceremonies were conducted in `` peace and security.''

 Two black men were killed when a group attacked a funeral procession with long, curved knives, and a third black man was stabbed to death in a separate attack, police said Sunday. In their daily unrest report for the preceding 24 hours, police said the attack on the funeral procession occurred at <LOCATION> Guguletu </LOCATION>, a black township outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The other death occurred in Sweet Waters, in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province, when a group of blacks attacked a man in a home, police said.

<TEXT>
 A letter signed by about 10,000 people expressing support for the captain and crew of the USS Vincennes finally reached the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Sunday after bouncing around in limbo for five days. The letter, actually a bulky package weighing about 50 pounds, apparently went from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and then back to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before it landed here and was turned over to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> DHL </ORGANIZATION>, the express delivery service that handled the shipment, said it was not taken off an airliner that landed at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> last Wednesday, and went on to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. It was found there and returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON>, said the letter would be delivered to the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in a regular helicopter mail shipment, probably on Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowrey </PERSON>, R-Calif., sponsored the signature-collection campaign last weekend to show support for the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> after its crew shot down an Iranian jetliner, killing all 290 aboard, on July 3 The Pentagon said the crew believed the airliner was an Iranian jet fighter coming in for attack. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> is the missile cruiser's home port. One <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> source, who asked not to be named, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were `` not overjoyed'' about the project even before the letter went astray, because it drew new attention to the jetliner tragedy. A team of six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts is investigating the shooting down of the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> A300 Airbus. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> left the gulf four days ago after spending two weeks at anchor here while investigators took depositions and collected other data. Their report is due early next month. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is now in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, operating with the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forrestal </ORGANIZATION>'s carrier battle group that supports <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> operations in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. It is due to return home in late August. The letter, described as hand-written on a large poster board, expresses `` strong support'' for Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and the crew of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> `` as you strive to do your duty to God and country in troubled waters far from home.'' The signatures were on long rolls of paper attached to the letter. The list was first reported to be about 570 feet long, four feet longer than the cruiser itself. But <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Lowrey </PERSON>, was quoted on Saturday as saying it was actually 1,000 feet long. The 49th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> convoy of the year was en route down the gulf, with the missile frigate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> escorting the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gas </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON>, said a spokesman at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command headquarters in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The convoy came a year to the day after another tanker, the 401,382-ton <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, struck a mine on the first upbound convoy of Kuwaiti ships reflagged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as protection from Iranian attack. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of supporting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the Iran-Iraq war. The mining prompted a major buildup of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and five European navies in the gulf. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 14 warships in the gulf at present. Two vessels, the destroyer <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and the missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sides </PERSON>, left the gulf for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Sunday.

<HEAD>Chicago's Smoking Ban Goes Into Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associate Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This city known for cigar-chomping politicians and smoke-filled rooms on Sunday became the latest to try to clear the air, banning smoking in a host of public places ranging from taxis to train terminals. Despite the threat of fines, there were already indications of rebellion. `` I'll smoke in my own cab no matter what the law says,'' said taxi driver <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 44, a three-pack a day smoker. `` I will never tell a passenger not to smoke,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who had two packs of cigarettes sitting next to him on the front seat of his cab. The ordinance passed May 25 by the City Council is similar to regulations passed by several other cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It bans smoking entirely in enclosed public areas such as meeting rooms and taxicabs and requires restaurants with 40 seats or more to set aside smoking and non-smoking areas. It requires that at least half the areas of airport terminals, train stations and bus depots be non-smoking. The law also addresses smoking in the work place. Employers must designate smoking and no-smoking areas if workers request them. No smoking signs must be posted in all designated areas. Bars and private meetings are exempt from the ordinance, which carries fines ranging from $ 25 to $ 100. Police will follow the rule of `` persuasion and warning to seek compliance,'' said Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Culloton </PERSON>, adding that investigating complaints of illegal smoking will not be a top priority. `` With all the calls we get for rapes, robberies and everything else, that wo n't be often,'' he said. Taxi driver <PERSON> Suheil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ajaj </PERSON> said he thinks the law `` stinks'' because it will reduce business. `` I believe the customer is paying for the right to smoke,'' he said. `` I'm not a smoker, but I think it's their right to smoke in my cab.'' `` I think it's a pain for everybody,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sianas </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goat </PERSON>'s Tavern, a watering hole off <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sianas </PERSON> said the vast majority of his patrons smoke, so even though he intends to designate 15 of his 90 seats as non-smoking the overall impact will hardly be noticed because `` the smoke blows all around.'' `` How can you stop them from smoking?'' he asked. `` You can put up a sign, but I'm not going to grab a cigarette out of somebody's hand. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> favors the new law, which was supported by 33 aldermen. But <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, one of eight who opposed the measure, said police `` would be better placed trying to chase criminals than smokers.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a political analyst, said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s ban wo n't necessarily change the image of the city of big shoulders `` The so-called smoke-filled room is an image of something going on out of the sight of the public, so the smoking ban would not affect it,'' he said. And with a rise in the number of non-smokers, `` the smoke-filled room itself is not necessarily smoke-filled,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said.

A second <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team is expected to arrive in the Iranian capital within the next few days to work out details of a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> offensives threatened a cease-fire. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s incursion in the southern war front, which began Friday, was over and that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops had withdrawn. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Saturday that Iraqi troops backed by tanks, warplanes and chemical weapons thrust nearly 40 miles into Iranian territory. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday the attack had been repulsed with 9,000 Iraqi dead and wounded. Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> called his people to action in a message broadcast on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. `` Now that the Iraqi troops have stepped on the Islamic territory of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, no response except that of weapons is permissible,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said in the message, which was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` The nation must rush to the assistance of the armed forces,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said, adding that he `` will take my worthless body and life to the front of justice and present myself for divine duty.'' As <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> headed for the front lines, Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to meet with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said he had sent <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> a letter saying <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military action threatened a cease-fire and calling for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to take `` timely and preventive action,'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief has invited <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for peace talks. Interviewed Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he hoped hostilities would cease when he began discussions with the two leaders. `` Until there is a cease-fire, I can not complain,'' the secretary-general said. `` The only thing which I have done ... is to make an appeal to both sides to exert restraint. And I hope, of course, that when ... I start my discussion with the parties, I think there will not be military activities in the area.'' Asked if upcoming Iran-Iraq peace talks would be held face-to-face, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said: `` My idea is to discuss separately with both sides. Of course, I will be only too pleased if, at some stage, I could have the two sides together.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants to hold direct negotiations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> refused but later indicated it might agree to them at <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s request. In the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the state-run daily <ORGANIZATION> Ath-Thawra </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has `` no greedy intentions on Iranian territory and does not want to humiliate the Iranian people.'' The article, quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military actions following <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution last week were designed to recapture <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory to take `` as many prisoners of war as possible. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has said taking a large number of prisoners would help in peace negotiations. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the resolution, which calls for return to previous borders and a prisoner exchange, when it passed a year ago. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims it captured 8,636 prisoners of war in its incursion Friday and Saturday. According to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> figures, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has about 50,000 Iraqi POW's and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> held 13,000 Iranian soldiers before the latest raid. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranian Cabinet met Sunday and praised the Iranian people for heeding the call to join soldiers at the battlefronts. The Cabinet announced that on August 2, a Moslem holy day in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, mass rallies would be held by Iranians `` to reaffirm their allegiance to Imam -LRB- <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its aircraft flew 148 combat missions inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Sunday and that two planes crashed in Iranian territory. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the two jets were shot down. The Iraqi communique said helicopter gunships carried out 217 combat sorties `` inflicting important losses on enemy men, weaponry and equipment.'' It said four Iranian soldiers were killed in other minor action. The Iranian agency said the border town of <LOCATION> Karand-e-Gharb </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION> province was hit by `` cluster bombs'' and seven civilians were killed. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denied the claim.

 A cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war means the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would reduce its naval forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and halt the escort of tankers `` as soon as we judge it safe, prudent to do so,'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said it is too early to specify a date for a halt in the 1-year-old administration policy of protecting the reflagged Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attacks. `` It's a little hard to make that kind of judgment at this point,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' when asked about a date for ending the escorts. `` We want to watch the negotiations. We'd probably want to take some reasonable interval to make certain that the ceasefire holds,'' he said. `` But there's no desire to keep 27 ships there any longer than possible.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships will remain in the gulf, as they have for 40 years, but said `` we would certainly draw down -LRB- the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships -RRB- as soon as feasible.'' Until the reflagging policy began, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had only five or six ships in the waterway. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week agreed to accept the terms of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution 598, which proposes a ceasefire as the first major step toward a negotiated peace. That raised hopes that the bloody 8-year-old conflict would soon end. But as representatives of both countries prepare to meet this week at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has launched a series of attacks into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, the deputy secretary of state, both said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies deserve credit for influencing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to accept the resolution. `` The fact that we have been resolute, that we have stood by our friends, that we have stood by the principles of freedom of navigation and that he -LRB- Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> -RRB- has not been able to drive us from the gulf has had a significant impact on Iranian thinking,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` Furthermore, our staunchness in this area has helped to isolate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the world community,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` We have been quite successful in preventing our countries from shipping arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, so gradually <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> came to the realization that their policies were not succeeding, that they were not going to drive us out of the area.'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' said, `` this is a time if not for bragging, at least it's a time, I think, for all of us to be proud that our policy has been a success.'' `` Certainly <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision is not solely attributable to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy,'' he said, `` but our firmness of our military presence in the gulf, our indication that we planned to stay there as long as it was necessary, and at the same time our diplomatic track, principally at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, has finally achieved success.'' Both men also said an end to the war could eventually lead to improved U.S.-Iran relations and the possible release of American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by Iranian-backed groups. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he did n't know about any `` specific message'' from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> seeking improved relations, but added, `` We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, all they have to do is designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and we'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, about terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever is appropriate. `` If they want to talk about policy issues, hostages, terrorism ... we'd be pleased to do that,'' he said. Asked specifically about reports the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages might be released, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, `` We're obviously not going to discuss any quid pro quo -LRB- with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB-, but if the Iranians want to talk to us about the hostage situation and how they're going to go about influencing their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about it.'' Nine Americans are being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I'm not in the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for the hostages. That is contrary to our policy,'' he said. As President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boarded Air Force One to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he was asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ready for talks about the hostages. He appeared not to hear the question and did not respond. Later, aboard the plane, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the hostage situation is easy to solve. `` All they have to do is release them,'' he said. `` They do n't need negotiations to release the hostages. We are willing to talk to anybody any place but we are not willing to negotiate. We are not willing to pay ransom. There is no need. They took them they should release them. As far as we are concerned nothing has changed in regard to the hostages,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> kicked off a week of haute couture shows for winter Sunday with plenty of luxury and an about-face in style, abandoning the short pouf skirts that made him famous and presenting a variety of styles. His show received politely enthusiastic response from the buyers and press, but there was no screaming ovation, as there was at last year's. Some found the show rather confusing, as if <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> did n't always know what to do with all that lovely fabric In clothes aimed at opulence, the effect was sometimes perfect, sometimes awkward or heavy-looking. But most agreed these clothes look much more wearable than the past _ even though couture is only worn by a handful of women who pay astronomical prices, well up in the thousands of dollars, for a simple dress. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> kept his sense of fun in bright miniskirts with full paisley overskirts, worn with jeweled suede boots and an oversized hat. His new suit looks varied. One red model with a long jacket and short skirt was a dead ringer for the Chanel style. Another is the short-long effect with the billowing overskirt to offset a shorter skirt underneath. The full pantskirts or flowing pajamas were sometimes given a buttoned-up, high-waisted sailor suit look, dressed up with mink capes or fox jackets. Cowl hoods and draped fichu collars are still <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> trademarks. The great invention of the collection was a tuxedo. It came out as a smashing dark crepe jumpsuit with big rhinestone buttons, large white satin lapels and cuffs on the jacket. The evening gowns were varied and elaborate, with brown in brocades, chiffons and velvet a big favorite. But <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> juggled his palette throughout the show, alternating combinations of hot colors with softly graded combinations. A midnight blue velvet sheath with its topping of a puffy bow and train of many-hued brown, blue and gray tulle was a knockout. Following the <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> show was the evening wear at <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>'s show Each carefully made black-gray-white model drifted out painted or decorated with seagulls and waves, birds, butterflies and trees. Dresses featured large leaf patterns and trim. Mrs. <PERSON> Mori </PERSON> showed a wearable collection of outfits that showed the knee, emphasized intricate draping and detail and brought out some flyaway toppers, shorter in the front.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, trying to bolster his standing among women voters, on Sunday proposed a wide-ranging child-care proposal that could give low-income families government checks of up to $ 1,000 per child. The proposed program would cost $ 2.2 billion a year and eventually apply to all families with children under age 4 in which at least one parent worked, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Families who did n't get a government check would get a tax credit, under the plan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> and Profession Women's Clubs. At first, it would apply only to low-income families, and would be phased in over four years to include higher-income households. Initial reaction to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal was favorable, but tempered with criticism of his overall record on women's issues. `` This is one of his first concrete gestures'' toward women, said federation president <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wray </PERSON>. Asked how she would rate the speech, she replied: `` As far as addressing our issues, he escalated on any scale. But as far as addressing the kinds of things we'd like to see advanced, he did n't come close to a 10. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, many members of the audience chanted `` E-R-A,'' a reference to the Equal Rights Amendment, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes. The vice president said the tax credit, which would be in addition to the existing child care tax credit and the federal deduction for dependents, is designed `` to recognize the increased costs of families with children.'' There would be no strings attached to the tax credit and it would apply equally to those who paid for outside child care and those who did n't. `` As businesswomen, I do n't need to tell you that child care is a significant business expense,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the audience, made up of about 2,500 professional women. The certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee, who has proposed an overall freeze on federal spending at the rate of inflation, did not specify how his wide-ranging proposals would be financed. He was accompanied to the speech by former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, a frequently mentioned vice presidential possibility. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, wife of former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> here aboard Air Force Two, and, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides, helped worked on the final draft of his speech. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said that there was no discussion during the flight of the vice presidential selection process. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spoke to the convention after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticized a $ 2.5 billion day-care proposal now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ and favored by Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ that would provide direct government assistance to day-care providers. It would not be limited to low-income families. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s child-care program included: _ Expansion of the existing child-care tax credit to cover more low-families, at a cost of $ 400 million a year _ Creation of work-place child-care centers for all government employees, modeled after a program begun by Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and a federally underwritten liability insurance program for private centers, costing $ 50 million a year _ More federal assistance to help states and local governments set up programs such as sick child care and before-and-after school care, at a cost of $ 250 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals received polite, but scattered, applause from the bipartisan audience. `` I'm not going to give you a political speech,'' he declared. However, he told the audience that `` one of my attributes for president is I did what many of you did _ I started a business.'' `` The expanded role for women in the work force is dramatic. It is the single most important demographic change in the second half of the 20th century,'' he said. But still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that women still earn only 70 cents for every dollar earned by men. He said that, while this was up from the 59 cents of just a few years ago, `` there is only one amount that women should earn for every dollar earned by a man _ and that is one dollar.'' Members of the audience cheered this remark loudly and waved red purses, a symbol of the disparity in pay between genders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was presented with such a purse. Campaign aides depicted the speech as a major effort to underscore <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to issues affecting working women. His campaign has been making a push to improve his standing among women voters, shown by a series of polls to be a weak point for him. Republican analysts have said that part of the `` gender gap'' problem _ which also afflicted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in both 1980 and 1984 _ reflects voter registration breakdown: a greater proportion of women are Democrats than men. However, some women's groups have accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as well as the overall <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, of insensitivity to women's issues and other social concerns and an overemphasis on defense issues. Asked why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention the Equal Rights Amendemnt in his talk, aide <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said, `` These are today's relevant issues.'' But <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, president-elect of the organization, said, `` He may be beyond it -LRB- the ERA -RRB- but we are not.''

 Military officials from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> met privately on an island off the African coast in an effort to work out a peace accord for southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a news report said Sunday. The Portuguese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> government spokesman as saying the meetings occurred last week on the island of <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> archipelago. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, confirmed that representatives of the four nations met on the island Thursday and Friday. He did not name the representatives. `` During the meeting, there was an exchange of views on the military situation which will continue to be discussed in the forthcoming meeting to be held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>,'' he said. After U.S.-mediated negotiations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the nations on July 20 announced an agreement in principle for the withdrawal of foreign troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which is also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for 73 years. More talks are scheduled in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> next month. The Portuguese agency quoted unidentified <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> officials as saying that the talks there were mediated by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. It quoted the officials as saying the talks may have been aimed at setting a timetable for the troop withdrawals and for the implementation of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Maj. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Super </PERSON>, Pentagon weekend duty officer, said he knew nothing about the talks or the possible participation of Wood. The Portuguese agency, in a report from the capital, <LOCATION> Praia </LOCATION>, quoted <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrilho </PERSON> as saying that the delegations were headed by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s armed forces commander in chief, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Franca </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadula </PERSON>; his Cuban counterpart, Gen. <PERSON> Jannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON>; and Gen. <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosala </PERSON> <PERSON> Deltor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> said the delegations were headed by deputy foreign ministers of the nations. The report said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Silvino </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> also was at the meetings. The talks are aimed at ending a 13-year war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where guerrillas backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are fighting the Marxist government, supported by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. There are about 50,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it has 3,000 troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, but the Angolans say the figure is 9,000. <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> is a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony where <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> held their first face-to-face talks in the early 1980s.

<TEXT>
 Like a repentant sinner, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s governing party is finding it difficult to convince others it has seen the light. Even if national elections on July 6, when the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won by the slimmest margin in its 59 years of existence, were as squeaky clean as the party claims, many Mexicans remain skeptical. Officials of the party that has dominated modern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s government now admit _ at least in private _ that misdeeds were not unknown in the past `` But look at what we did this time,'' one said in frustration, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` If we wanted to act as we did in the past, the opposition would not have obtained anything.'' Indeed, whether forced by circumstance or out of genuine belief in reform, the party, known as <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, conceded congressional defeats and grudgingly settled for a 50.3 percent majority for its winning presidential candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> finished with 31 percent, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained 17 percent. Despite the opposition's best showing in decades, both <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> have taken to the road, calling on Mexicans to challenge the tallies, which they say are fraudulent. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> had never before fallen below the 70 percent level. Moreover, what people here call the `` full-wagon'' policy _ 100 percent of everything _ is not that distant a memory. In what may have been the most difficult statement ever uttered by a <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said in proclaiming his victory: `` The era of virtually only one party is ending, and we are entering now a new political stage.'' Until now, modern Mexican history has made `` PRI'' practically a synonym for `` government.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1929 by government leaders as an instrument to retain power through the control of labor unions, peasant organizations indebted to government financing agencies, bureaucrats and teachers. It used, and still uses, government resources as its own. Any political opposition was considered against the 1910-21 revolution. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was a key part of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s domain. In a supposedly federal system, the party leadership in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> assigned congressional seats, governships, municipalities, and other government jobs to the country's regions. This time, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> will not have the two thirds needed in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of congress, to make constitutional amendments. In a complicated system that offers 300 of 500 seats for direct election and reserves a significant portion of the rest for the opposition, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> will hold 260 and the combined opposition 240. In a development that will have less impact but is perhaps more symbolic, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> gave up for the first time four of the 64 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Despite government claims, ballot-stuffing and take-all habits do, of course, die hard. Journalists witnessed ballot stuffing in the northern border state of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. Other allegations were widespread throughout the country. A slow vote count lingered from the old system when people voted, the government took the ballot boxes, and two weeks later announced who won. Official results were not announced until July 13, a week after the election. Even for the nonpartisan, suspicions were hard to avoid. Electoral officials privately said there were more voters this time than in previous elections. Yet their totals show that only half of 38 million registered voters went to the polls, compared to 75 percent in 1982. Even the most loyal party officials privately admit that past figures were inflated to enhance <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation or simply to spread the illusion of support for the system and cover up voter apathy. Despite widespread skepticism, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> and his reform-minded associates had insisted during the campaign that they intended to modernize and democratize the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` Keep in mind this is a new experience for us all,'' one top government official said in an interview. `` We will have to learn to live with it.'' `` This is a Mexican perestroika,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He was referring to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of social and economic reforms.

<TEXT>
 Forty years after President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> ordered the integration of the armed forces, black veterans of the Korean War have won a battle for a fresh look at an Army history they find disparaging. The Army has ordered a review of accounts of a black regiment that could lead to a change in the official history. Executive Order 9981, issued by <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> 40 years ago Tuesday, did not bring immediate integration to the military, in which black units were largely segregated and commanded by whites. But `` as a result of <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s order, the military became one of the first major American institutions to desegregate and routinely place blacks in positions of authority over whites,'' says <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The military, grudgingly at first, served `` as an engine of social change and racial justice,'' <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> wrote in the May edition of the center's magazine. The last major black unit, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 94th Engineer Battalion, was not broken up until 1954. And when the Korean War broke out, two years after <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> issued his order, the 24th Infantry Regiment was still an all-black outfit, commanded by white officers, on occupation duty in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The 24th was among the first units sent to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and was bloodied in the battles which raged up and down the penninsula. An official <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> history of the first months of the war, written by <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleman </PERSON> and issued in 1961, describes the performance of the 24th in highly uncomplimentary terms, glossing over a battle at <LOCATION> Yechon </LOCATION>, an engagement that another book published last year calls the first major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> victory in the war. The Army's treatment of the 24th Regiment rankled Korean War veteran <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, a black graduate of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> who has campaigned for nine years for a revision of <PERSON> Appleman </PERSON>'s work. The official history, <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> said in an interview, `` uses terms which are offensive. The ulterior motive, like all other references to black combat units, is intended to denigrate the contributions that black fighting men have made for our country.'' Army Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> this month ordered that the Chief of Military History, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stofft </PERSON>, to review <PERSON> Appleman </PERSON>'s work `` to address expressed concerns about the portrayal of the 24th Infantry Regiment.'' An Army spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Rixon </PERSON>, said it is not clear what will happen if <PERSON> Appleman </PERSON>'s version is found to be flawed. <PERSON> Appleman </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Rixon </PERSON>, is ill and not available to comment. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, however, is confident the official version will be revised, which he says is `` extremely gratifying to me.'' The official history calls the 24th `` an all Negro-regiment'' and repeatedly describes it in terms more negative than used for all-white regiments under what were apparently similar circumstances. The 24th, wrote <PERSON> Appleman </PERSON>, was `` frightened and demoralized,'' had a `` tendency to panic,'' `` straggled'' in retreat, and required two officers for every one in another unit: `` one must command and the other must drive.'' Nearly all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> units in the war retreated in disorder at various times, especially after the Peoples' Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> joined the fight, but <PERSON> Appleman </PERSON> time after time singled out the 24th for what he called a `` chaotic'' flight, or a `` disgraceful episode.'' The most glaring slight seems to have been in the official <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> description of the battle of <LOCATION> Yechon </LOCATION>. `` The first action -LRB- for the 24th -RRB- ... if indeed it was an action at all, appears to have occured at <LOCATION> Yechon </LOCATION> on 20 July,'' <PERSON> Appleman </PERSON> wrote. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> dispatch on July 20-21 by war correspondent <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, who was with the unit, described <PERSON> Yechon </PERSON> as `` the first sizable <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ground victory in the Korean War.'' And an official <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> report at the time called <PERSON> Yechon </PERSON> `` the first <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> city restored to friendly hands by American troops.

<HEAD>Jurors Doubt Verdict Against Migrant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three members of a jury that convicted a Mexican migrant worker of murder have formed a support group for the man after voicing doubts about their decision. `` I feel there is a really good chance he is innocent and we need to do something about it,'' <PERSON> Sherien </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> said in an interview with The Sunday Oregonian. <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> voted to convict <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> as a jury member in October 1986. Ventura was sentenced to life in prison for the crime. <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> said she has been tormented by doubt ever since the trial. She said another juror, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, called her three days after the trial and `` said she felt very uncomfortable.'' `` She asked me how I felt,'' <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> said. `` I just felt that I had made a mistake, and I did n't know what to do about it.'' Now <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and a third juror, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralls </PERSON>, visit <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> in prison, send money and write letters to the state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> pleading for his release. Transcripts from the trial show that only one witness, an illegal immigrant from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, testified that Ventura was the killer. The witness, <PERSON> Epifanio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bautista </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, initially testified that he saw nothing, but changed his testimony after a recess and he was taken into the district attorney's office. Under cross-examination, <PERSON> Bautista </PERSON> said he was afraid of what might happen to him if he did not testify the way the prosecutor wanted him to testify. While jurors deliberated, they initially were split over the question of <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>'s guilt. <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> was among those voting not guilty. Unable to reach a verdict, the jury was excused for the night. Back in the jury room the next morning, <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> changed her vote to guilty, leaving only <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glorya </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppitz </PERSON> on the innocent side, and they eventually relented. <PERSON> Oppitz </PERSON> has refused to join the support group formed by <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralls </PERSON>, but said she would like to erase the trial from her memory. Other jurors said they had no second thoughts. `` I felt he was guilty because he never testified,'' said <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, another juror. Several days after the trial, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oppitz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ralls </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> visited defense co-counsel <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>, saying they had changed their minds and asking if they could do anything about it. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> found that a verdict can not be thrown out simply because jurors change their minds. The support group has decided that if all other legal recourse fails, they will ask Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> to commute Ventura's sentence. Meanwhile, an appeal is pending.

<HEAD>Government Balks at Paying Mortgage on Seized House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government is refusing to pay off the mortgage on a confiscated $ 1.1 million home, arguing that <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> should have known the house was bought with drug money. `` At best for the bank, Republic stuck its head in the sand to avoid obtaining the knowledge of the drug connection,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagen </PERSON> charged in court papers. Republic seeks repayment on its loan to a Panamanian company the government says was controlled by convicted smuggler <PERSON> Indalecio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>. `` If this is upheld, it could force banks to run <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> checks on every borrower,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beiley </PERSON>, attorney for Republic. Under federal laws, the government may seize properties bought or built with drug profits, or homes in which drug deals occurred. The laws also provide that the government must honor mortgages or liens on seized properties _ if the mortgage holder is an innocent party. After the government seized the palatial five-bedroom home in an exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Coral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cables </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood last month, the bank asked that its one-year $ 800,000 mortgage be paid off when the house was sold. But the government refused. Federal prosecutors contend in court documents that <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> was laundering his ill-gotten gains when his <ORGANIZATION> Thule </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pledged its sole asset _ the house _ as collateral for the mortgage in 1987. `` Of course, we did n't know anything about it. We had no idea,'' Republic President <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Mata </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> Sunday. No charges are pending against <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>, although he was convicted of smuggling marijuana in 1981. The government says Republic should have guessed a drug connection existed. `` Despite suspicious circumstances, Republic looked the other way while accepting gratuities from <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>,'' the government says in court papers, which allege the house was built using the millions of dollars <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> earned smuggling drugs from 1980 to 1985. <LOCATION> Thule </LOCATION> allegedly paid for airplane tickets and a hotel room for de la <PERSON> Mata </PERSON>'s son's honeymoon only three days after the $ 800,000 mortgage was approved in a hastily called meeting of Republic's loan committee <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Mata </PERSON> contends that <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Puentes </PERSON>, an old customer with no connection to <LOCATION> Thule </LOCATION>, gave his son the trip. The government also says the bank should have been suspicious in part because de la <LOCATION> Mata </LOCATION> knew <LOCATION> Thule </LOCATION> was trying to sell the house. Also, granting the mortgage in just two weeks was unusual, as was granting a loan when the house was vacant, something banks rarely do, court papers say. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> attorneys say the government has n't proved that <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> was involved in smuggling in 1985, when the house was built, or that drug profits were used.

<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s attorney general, angered by the slayings of a TV anchorwoman and two others in a hail of police bullets, suspended the <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> head of the federal police and vowed to press an investigation. One federal police officer and three city police officers were arrested in the machine gun attack Saturday in downtown Juarez. `` My indignation is great,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, who visited <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> late Saturday and vowed the four officers would be brought to justice <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> pledged that `` the bad elements -LRB- in the federal force -RRB- will be removed. There are good elements in the force, ones who devote their lives to it. That is n't the case in this instance. ... We wo n't let this blow over.'' The driver of the victims' car, the anchorwoman's husband, said he had refused to stop for men who identified themselves as police because he was afraid they were robbers. He said he had $ 12,000 in the car. The four arrested officers told police they had mistaken the victims' car for a similar car carrying suspected narcotics traffickers who engaged in a shootout with police earlier Saturday. The officers were accused of killing <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>, 28, anchorwoman for station <ORGANIZATION> XHIJ </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>; her mother-in-law, <PERSON> Lucrecia </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, 58; and a family friend, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 25. Station officials said Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON> was three months' pregnant. She had two daughters. Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>'s husband and co-anchor, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said he was driving the car but escaped injury by lying on the floor. The attorney general suspended <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> here. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said the three city officers were `` madrinas,'' underlings who work illegally for members of the elite federal force. The practice, illegal because the city officers are not sworn as federal agents, gives the madrinas the thrill of working with a federal officer, who benefits from their unpaid assistance. Authorities said evidence indicated the killings were the result of mistaken identity, and not because <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON> were journalists. In the last six years, there have been more than 20 cases of unsolved murders of <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> journalists. Journalist groups allege that at least some of the reporters were killed in revenge for their work or to silence them. In an emotional phone call to the attorney general, <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> raised the possibility that he might have been targeted by drug traffickers for some of his work. But neither anchor was known for exposing drug traffickers or government corruption. Corruption allegedly is rife in all levels of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s police forces and was a major issue in the recent national election, won by the long-dominant <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> despite a record vote for the opposition. Transit police in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> routinely solicit bribes from Americans in exchange for not writing traffic tickets. Immigration officials have been accused of setting up fake checkpoints to shake down tourists. State and federal judicial police often are rumored to accept money from narcotics traffickers in exchange for protection. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said the assailants shouted from their car that they were with the federal judicial police and ordered him to stop. He said he did n't stop at first because he was afraid they would search his car and steal $ 12,000 in cash he had collected for doing publicity work for a traveling circus. He told police that he stopped when the men struck his car with theirs. Then the men got out with automatic weapons and, without a word, opened fire. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Armendariz </PERSON>, the new head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, said the four officers had mistaken <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>' car for one involved in a shootout with federal police about two hours earlier 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>. Federal police had an anonymous tip that the car was carrying 80 kilograms, or 176 pounds, of cocaine, <PERSON> Armendariz </PERSON> said. Saturday afternoon, police found an abandoned, bullet-riddled and blood-splattered car matching the shootout car's description with 38 kilograms, or 83 pounds, of cocaine in the trunk, state judicial police commander <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivas </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A heavy barrage of rockets on Sunday slammed into the southern edge of the Afghan capital, hitting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a Western diplomat said. Newspapers reported the shelling of a Pakistani border village. Pakistani daily newspapers reported Sunday that six people were killed and 21 injured when the Afghan army shelled the border village of <LOCATION> Chaman </LOCATION>, in southwestern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, on Saturday. One newspaper report said the Pakistani army returned fire. The Pakistani government made no immediate comment on that report. No immediate word of casualties was given after Sunday's rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, blamed on anti-government guerrillas. The diplomat's report followed near-daily rocket attacks blamed on the guerrillas. During the past three weeks, 130 rockets have blasted the capital, killing 80 people and injuring more than 100, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. The latest attack also came after <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of bringing troops back into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to shore up struggling government forces around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Soviets have agreed to withdraw all of their estimated 115,000 troops by Feb. 15, leaving 50,000 government soldiers to fight about 200,000 Pakistani-backed guerrillas. The Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said at least four people died in a late-night rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Friday. During an address on Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Sunday to mark the Islamic holiday of <ORGANIZATION> Eid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> al-Adha </ORGANIZATION>, Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said another rocket attack Saturday killed several people. He blamed the attack on Afghan guerrillas who have been fighting the communist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> for the past 10 years. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, also reported four people were killed and nine injured when rockets blasted the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on Friday. <LOCATION> Chaman </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> newspapers reported the shelling, lies about five miles from the Afghan town of <LOCATION> Spinbuldak </LOCATION>, which rebels had surrounding. Quoting official sources, a Pakistani opposition paper, The <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> army troops returned fire. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the Soviet troop withdrawal, provided for in an accord in April, was progressing, but he said stepped-up guerrilla attacks were `` obstructing'' it. He did not elaborate. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> denied Pakistani President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>'s charge that the troop withdrawal had stopped and 10,000 soldiers were recalled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to prop up the defense of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said. Quoting Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that 35,000 troops have left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said half of an estimated 115,000 troops will be out by Aug. 15. Meanwhile, another Soviet military officer, breaking with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s official line, said he doubted the Afghan army can survive after Soviet troops leave. He predicted Islamic fundamentalists will gain power. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON>, who served as a Soviet adviser to Afghan troops, also told the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> in its July 30 issue that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s governing party is hopelessly disorganized and has bungled opportunities to make peace with insurgents.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned to the nation's capital Sunday after a week-long vacation at his mountaintop ranch north in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and prepared to deal with the drought, aid to Nicaraguan rebels and the fall political campaign The president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were joined on the trip back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One by Secretary of the Treasury <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke Saturday night at a fund-raising reception in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for the re-election campaign of Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif. An administration official dismissed speculation that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s presence signaled any immediate announcement of his resignation to run Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential `` Essentially he is hitching a ride,'' the official said, speaking on condition he not be identified.. `` The fund-raiser had been scheduled for some time and he is hitching a ride back on Air Force One.'' Another official, speaking on the same condition, said an announcement of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plans is expected early in August. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is as near certainty as can be to win the Republican presidential nomination at the GOP convention that opens in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 15. On board Air Force One en route to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, reporters asked presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> about <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plans and were told he did not know, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had only a `` very brief chat. They chatted in the hallway.'' `` He's still treasury secretary, put it that way,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. When reporters sent <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> a note asking them to come back and talk to them about the question, he replied with a note in a folder that contained a dollar bill. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> wrote, `` Please note the title under the signature.'' The title under <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s signature on currency is secretary of the treasury. Leaving the airplane at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, a reporter asked <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, `` Can you share the news with us?'' He replied, `` There's no news to share.'' The president has summoned <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders to the White House on Tuesday for a meeting that officials say will focus on plans for the remaining six months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, including discussions of assistance for the rebels against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist-led government. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, the president's chief of staff, told reporters in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> that in addition to the congressional leadership meeting, he will be consulting with administration officials and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supporters outside government during the week to develop `` plans and strategies to get things done.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> will report to the president during the week on a trip of 10 drought-stricken states that he and other government officials have completed. Also coming up during the week is a midyear review of the budget. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not think it would affect the availability of funds for drought relief. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is committed to making at least two campaign trips a week on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidates after September, would speak at two <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising events in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> while in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for another ranch vacation next month and might make at least one campaign appearance before he leaves for the New orleans convention on Aug. 14. The president devoted his weekly radio address Saturday to an attack on the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where he said speakers repeated `` the same sad song they sang four years ago.'' He did not, as he had in some speeches, specifically attack Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, nor did he mention <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whom he has often lavishly praised. The vice president will have lunch with the president on Thursday.

In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qabatiya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed one Palestinian and wounded three others, the army said without identifying the victims. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said one <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military officer was injured during the clash. A Palestinian died at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hadassah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after being shot at least twice during a demonstration in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jala </LOCATION>, the army and hospital officials said. The hospital sources said the 38-year-old man tried to throw a brick at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The deaths raised to 233 the known number of Palestinians killed since they began an uprising Dec. 8. in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Four Israelis also have been slain in the violence. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 25 Palestinians were wounded by beatings by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops or by rubber bullets fired by the soldiers during a series of clashes, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> hospital officials said. The army imposed or extended curfews on eight cities and refugee camps in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, confining about 250,000 Palestinians to their homes. Increased police security was mounted in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the walled section of Arab east <LOCATION> Jeruslem </LOCATION>, as Moslems and Jews celebrated major ceremonies. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> after the 1967 Middle East War. It later annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Moslems prayed on the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> to mark Eid al-Ahda, or the `` Feast of Sacrifice,'' which commemorates <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s preparations to sacrifice his son at God's instructions. At the last moment the son was spared and instead a sheep was sacrificed. Jews marked <PERSON> Tisha </PERSON> <PERSON> B'Av </PERSON>, the anniversary or the destruction by Roman troops of the Holy Jewish Temple about 2,000 years ago. More than 100 Jewish militants who demand Israeli control over the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> held a prayer vigil at its gates but were barred by police from entering. Jews can visit the area individually but under an arrangement with Moslem religious authorities they are not allowed to pray on the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. Police later barred the group from entering the adjacent Moslem quarter after they refused to abandon the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags they were carrying. But about 20 followers of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the militantly anti-Arab Kach movement managed to slip through the police lines and marched into the district with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags before being stopped by police. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said armed Kach members circulated through the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and police said two were arrested. The Kach movement, headed by U.S.-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, calls for the ouster of Arabs from Israeli-held territory. Few tourists visited the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and other sections of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` There is a tremendous police presence here, and we are a little worried about getting caught in something,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeely </PERSON>, a 47-year-old lawyer from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, as he and his wife walked along <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Stepfather Sentenced To Six Years In Prison After Girl Recants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINTER GARDEN, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors have refused to grant immunity from perjury charges to a 14-year-old girl who recanted sex abuse charges against her stepfather before he was sentenced to six years in prison. The girl now says she lied two years ago when she initially told of the alleged abuse and lied again in April before the jury that convicted her stepfather because she was afraid of going to jail for perjury. She is working with her mother to get her stepfather a new trial by raising money to hire a lawyer for an appeal. The mother and daughter publicized their cause over the weekend by being interviewed by The Orlando Sentinel, but the identities of the two adults and the girl were not revealed in keeping with state law. Prosecutors contend the mother indirectly pressured the girl into recanting. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said the reason for refusing to grant her immunity, however, is that to do so would condone lying. The girl either lied when she made up the charges, or would have been lying when she recanted, the prosecutor said. `` It undermines the whole system,'' Ms. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said. `` Why should we say it's OK to lie? It's not our policy to grant immunity to people you think are telling lies under that immunity.'' Judge <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Formet </PERSON>, in what he called one of the toughest decisions he has made in nine years on the bench, denied the 34-year-old man's motion for a new trial. And he sentenced him to six years in prison on charges of lewd assault, although he had been informed the girl had recanted. The mother steadfastly denies pressuring her daughter to recant, and the daughter said the only pressure came from prosecutors angered by her decision to recant. The case began when the girl broke down in tears to her elementary school teacher in March 1986, right after a police officer had talked to her class about sexual abuse by parents and relatives. Now she says she made up the story because she wanted more time with her mother. `` It seemed like my mom paid a lot more attention when he was gone,'' the girl said. The girl met privately with the prosecutor, Ms. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, on June 1, the day of the sentencing, and told her she was lying. `` I was looking right at her,'' the girl said. `` She said, ` You could n't have lied that long.' She said, ` You're lying, you're lying' and hit the table She scared me.'' Ms. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> disagreed with the girl's version. `` I never yelled at her,'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said. `` I was trying to get her to explain why she waited until the sentencing to tell me. If I seemed angry, it was n't at her. I was upset that this was happening.''

 Police and an estimated 1,000 supporters of an opposition politican battled at <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s airport Sunday after authorities refused entry to an exiled dissident who seeks independence for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Officials said two reporters were hospitalized with head injuries after they were attacked by people in the crowd who apparently thought the journalists were plainclothes policemen.

They said Ms. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was denied entry because she might endanger <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s internal security and she did not have an entry visa. The crowd had gathered at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, 31 miles west of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, for the arrival of Hung Chi-chang, a leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who had visited the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wooed women voters Sunday with an ambitious child-care proposal, as yet another poll pointed up his need to close the `` gender gap.'' And Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with his running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wrapped up their first campaign swing as political partners. Both presidential contenders faced some vocal opposition on the campaign trail. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won praise for a $ 2.2 billion child-care plan he unveiled before a group of professional women. But when he finished speaking, many in the audience broke into chants of `` E-R-A'' _ a reference to the Equal Rights Amendment, which the vice president opposes. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who supports abortion rights, was heckled by anti-abortion protesters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where he attended church services. The Democrats, meanwhile, were looking back with satisfaction on their national convention, which ended last week, while the Republicans looked ahead to theirs, three weeks away. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One en route to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may make a Midwestern campaign trip on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf between now and the convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, promised at least one piece of GOP convention drama, pledging that the vice president would not unveil his choice of a running mate until next month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` He's going to keep his own counsel on it, and he's going to let us all know at the convention,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said Sunday in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face The Nation.'' `` I think that will be very exciting and very dramatic,'' he said. The Republicans say their convention preparations are proceeding on schedule, but local fund-raisers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> acknowledged they would have to work hard to hunt up the cash for facilities and services the city has promised to provide during the gathering. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, heading up the convention city's fund drive, said fund raising was running `` maybe a little behind'' but that the money should be on hand before the convention opens Aug. 15. Republicans and Democrats were united in one respect _ the amount of time they were devoting to talk of party unity. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s onetime rival for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, urged his supporters to rally behind the vice president. The television evangelist also said his flock was n't out to start any floor fights at the Republican convention. However, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rally in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> on Saturday that he would like to see a plank calling for the nomination of conservative candidates at all levels of the federal judiciary. The Democrats, meanwhile, were giving themselves good reviews. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said Democrats came out of their convention well positioned for a big win in the fall. `` It will be one of the great defeats in modern history for the Republicans,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said Sunday on `` Face the Nation.'' The governor, who got more attention as a non-candidate than some of the Democratic candidates did, said he would campaign for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` wherever he wants me.'' As for the candidates themselves, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was accompanied by former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as he addressed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> on Sunday. His child-care proposal was favorably received by the group. The proposal, initially affecting only low-income families, would eventually apply to all families with children under age 4 in which at least one parent worked, he said. `` This is one of his first concrete gestures'' toward women, the group's president, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wray </PERSON>, said afterward. A number of surveys have suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is better regarded by female voters than is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The latest poll, by <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 17 points overall _ 55 percent to 38 percent _ and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strength was due in part to the backing of 58 percent of the female voters. The survey of 948 registered voters, conducted July 21-22, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, attending Sunday church services with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, faced anti-abortion protesters outside. The governor calls abortion a `` difficult, very serious, very important ethical and moral judgment'' that a woman must make for herself. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, who had also sought the Democratic nomination. The Democratic nominee and his running mate got off to a running start after the convention that anointed them. They visited five states, including the big battlegrounds of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Sunday night, where he was welcomed by about 150 people at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, meanwhile, flew back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday night after a five-day campaign swing that took him to eight states. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a weekend fund-raising event, accompanied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on his return flight from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Sunday, but an administration official dismissed speculation that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s presence signaled any immediate announcement of his resignation to run the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had `` a very brief chat'' with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and added: `` He's still treasury secretary, put it that way.'' When reporters aboard the plane sent <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> a note asking them to come back and talk to him about the matter, he replied with a note with a folder that contained a dollar bill. `` Please note the title under the signature,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> wrote. That title, of course, is secretary of the treasury.

The <ORGANIZATION> Liberian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 40, a retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, 45, made the confessions Saturday night in the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials. The agency identified the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats as <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wauchupe </PERSON>, the charge d'affaires, and consular officer <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurty </PERSON>. Neither could be reached for comment Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Wiring insulation has been implicated in fires in at least 12 military and commercial aircraft models, but the hazard may actually be much more widespread, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>, in stories published Sunday and in an early Monday edition, said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was slow to notify its flight crews about dangers associated with the insulation, called <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON>, under certain conditions. <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> also was used on the space shuttle, and may have caused a fire during maintenance in 1983 that was n't blamed on insulation at the time, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> banned <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> in 1986 after documenting in laboratory tests that it can explode in flames and disable crucial flight-control systems. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> restricts <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> use only in high-vibration areas of new aircraft and recently issued a ban on its use in repairs. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contends that the conditions necessary for such an explosion to occur rarely exist except in laboratory tests and that it is impossible to determine whether the insulation was to blame for electrical fires in years gone by. Virtually all contractors who provide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aircraft to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> use <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> extensively, the newspaper said. No known deaths have been caused by insulation-related aircraft fires through almost two decades of the insulation's use in more than 50 kinds of aircraft. The newspaper reviewed 265 field reports dealing with electrical problems on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 and found at least 45 instances between 1978 and 1986 of wire fires or severe arcing. Included are six in-flight emergencies and two incidents considered potentially life-threatening by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the F-16. The single-engine fighters, which rely on electrical impulses to control their flight rather than mechanical wires and pulleys, each contains 10 miles of Kapton-coated wire, more than 85 percent of the aircraft's wiring. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> laboratory studies in 1984 and 1985 found that <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON>, a carbon-based film, can explode under certain conditions when exposed to an electrical arc. The heat of the arc causes the insulation to carbonize _ instantly deteriorate into a charry substance _ and form a conductive path for the arc to spread to adjacent wires in an instantaneous explosion known as `` flashover,'' or `` arc tracking.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s top civilian engineer, said flashover can only be documented by `` trained experts.'' <PERSON> Rall </PERSON> warned personnel about Kaptan in a newsletter dated March, 26, 1986, but concluded that it was `` an acceptable aircraft wire insulation given proper installation and maintenance procedures.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Technical Center in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said the agency is considering issuing guidelines on <LOCATION> Kapton </LOCATION> usage in commercial aircraft, such as recommending against its use in areas that are susceptible to moisture. `` We do not believe there's enough information that says you should ban <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> and take it out of the airplane,'' he said. `` We do think there is enough of a problem or a potential problem that we should make some changes.'' <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> began to gain popularity in the early and mid-1970s, first in the military and later in commercial aviation. Proponents said <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> was the perfect insulator, being small enough to fit into tight spaces on fighter jets, light enough to save precious fuel on airliners and strong enough, as required by government specifications, to last `` for the life of the aircraft.'' But as the insulation was put into service, maintenance crews initially complained that <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> was stiff, brittle and fragile and broke easily when bent. They argued that it was difficult to work with and required too much `` mothering'' to be practical. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a spokesman for E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON>, contends that any insulation will arc-track in the presence of conductive fluid. <PERSON> Lubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leger </PERSON>, head of the materials branch for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said a 1983 arcing incident aboard the shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> during maintenance may have been initially misdiagnosed. Contractor <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the incident listed the cause of the fire as `` not apparent,'' but <PERSON> Leger </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> said it had all the earmarks of a Kapton-related flashover. At least 100 aircraft electrical fires reported over the past 15 years have occurred under circumstances that bear striking similarities to <LOCATION> Kapton </LOCATION> failures, aircraft maintenance records and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> field studies suggest. Records cite initial damage to one or two wires followed by arcing that spreads the fire to adjacent wires.

<TEXT>
 Homosexual teachers should declare their sexual preference openly and confront those who would drive them from the public schools, speakers said Sunday at a conference of gay instructors. `` The time is right for us to assert ourselves in the educational field,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> high school teacher. `` We have so much power if we come out, and we have so little power if we're not out.'' That message, coming near the conclusion of <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON>'s keynote address, drew tumultuous applause from about 75 elementary, high school and college educators at the daylong conference, held in conjunction with a weeklong Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS Forum. Other speakers echoed the message of openness, but afterward, when the group divided into small workshops, boldness gave way to caution. `` To some of us, this is not real,'' said a teacher from a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> elementary school district who did n't want her name published. `` I'd love to tell my kids that I'm a lesbian, but if I did, I would n't be there Monday.'' When a young teacher from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> asked for advice on whether he should declare his homosexuality right away or wait until he had obtained tenure, the answer came in a chorus: `` Get tenure.'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenfeld </PERSON>, a teacher in the <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, schools, said he became a better teacher after he disclosed his sexual orientation. `` When I first got out of ed school, I thought I would n't say anything to my students about it,'' he recalled. `` But that drained me of my energy. When I came out it freed me up to be who I was and to channel my energy into constructive channels.'' However, <PERSON> Blumenfeld </PERSON> also cited a 1982 Gallup poll indicating that 59 percent of Americans felt homosexual educators should be excluded from public schools. The educators were united in asserting that they pose no danger to students and, in fact, can serve as positive role models. `` Homosexuality is not contagious,'' said <PERSON> Blumenfeld </PERSON>. `` Having an openly gay or lesbian teacher will not make students who are confused become gay or lesbian. `` But what it will do is it will show them that the option is OK, and if they happen to be gay, it will reduce their isolation.''

 Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> was released Sunday after being hospitalized for five nights following a mild stroke and said he felt good enough to campaign vigorously for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president. Asked if his illness had given him a new perspective on life, the 71-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said, `` My perspective has n't changed one iota _ beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> told reporters in the hospital lobby that he felt great, adding: `` I do n't anticipate that I'm going to curtail my activities at all. I'll continue to play tennis, I'll continue to go out to <LOCATION> Taos </LOCATION> -LRB- his vacation home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -RRB- _ which has a high altitude _ for vacation periods, I'll continue to have a full schedule so far as the governor's office is concerned.'' An attending physician said <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, was `` in excellent condition,'' according to <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntire </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The governor's release, originally scheduled for Saturday, was delayed on doctors' orders after they detected a slight irregularity in <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>' heart rhythm. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> admitted himself to <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday after consulting a physician about a vision problem.

The condition could have caused a tiny blood clot to form in his heart and pass into his brain, causing the stroke, the doctors said. Asked how long it would take for the governor to resume a normal work day, <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashur </PERSON> said, `` Dr. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has indicated it's a matter of several days to a week ...'' <PERSON> Bashur </PERSON> said doctors had indicated <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> would be `` on some form of medication for the heart rhythm for an indefinite period of time.''

At Knock he prayed for peace and met relatives of two men imprisoned in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombings. Shortly after arriving in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> went to impoverished west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Stopping amid the garbage and rubble of the Divis Flats housing project, where unemployment is 86 percent, he called it `` a Catholic ghetto.'' `` This grinds into my soul to see this kind of hopelessness that comes from unemployment. Basically, these kids are growing up with nothing,'' he said. `` Nobody offers them anything, and then the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> comes along and offers them status, offers them recognition.''. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a British province were Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Speaking of unemployment, <PERSON> O'Conner </PERSON> said, `` If it does n't end, it is just a festering, festering wound, and that is what ultimately creates violence.'' The cardinal met several <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> teen-agers, including 19-year-old <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McErlean </PERSON>. The youth's 20-year-old brother, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, was one of three people killed by a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> gunman in the March 16 <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> cemetery massacre that prompted <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s visit <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McErlean </PERSON> was asked what could bring peace to the area and he replied: `` Get the British army out and see what happens. Also jobs.'' Earlier in the day, before he said Mass at the Shrine of <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knock </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> met with the wife and mother of two men imprisoned after they were convicted of being involved in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> campaign to bomb taverns in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the mid-1970s. The women said they told <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> their relatives were innocent and convicted unfairly. `` We feel Cardinal <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> may well be able to raise this with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or whoever succeeds him,'' said <PERSON> Nuala </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the women and coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlkenny </PERSON>, whose husband <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> was convicted in two 1974 bombings in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> that killed 21 people, said of the cardinal, `` He's going to have a chat with some people when he gets back home.'' During the Mass, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> spoke of the meetings in his sermon. He made no mention of the merit of the cases but said he had `` the great privilege'' of speaking with <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, whose son <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has served 14 years of a life sentence for 1974 bombings in <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> arrived Friday for his Irish tour and is to leave Wednesday.

 A chartered bus carrying 46 people to a family reunion Sunday slammed into a low overhead bridge that peeled off its roof, toppling luggage onto passengers and injuring 35 people, police said. Most of the injured suffered cuts and wounds, said <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON>. They were taken to four hospitals. The only person admitted was <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who was listed in critical condition with head injuries, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loder </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>. The driver, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lassiter </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was charged with careless driving, <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Lassiter </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION>, was exceeding the speed limit while traveling 35 to 40 mph and failed to observe a sign warning of low bridge clearance. He said other accidents involving buses and trucks have occurred at the underpass, most involving out of state drivers unfamiliar with the low bridge and unattentive to a warning sign. The force of the collision sheared off most of the bus roof and sent luggage from overhead racks toppling onto the passengers, police said. The driver was unhurt, and the injured ranged in age from 10 months to 60 years old, police said. Unlike a bus accident on the <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION> on Saturday, in which 42 people were injured, there was no indication the driver of the bus in Sunday's wreck was in possession of any drug paraphernalia, <PERSON> Bunting </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Increased gasoline demand for summer travel pushed up prices an average of 2 cents a gallon during the past two weeks, an analyst said Sunday. While demand was the major factor, retailers also had been absorbing wholesale increases for about a month, said <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>, who oversees the twice monthly <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> Survey. The average price including taxes for all grades of self - and full-serve gasoline at the 12,000 outlets surveyed nationwide was $ 1.0168 at the end of last week, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said She predicted motorists may face further increases because during the latest survey period, July 8 to July 22, wholesale prices again increased more than retail prices. The survey found that the average price of gasoline at self-service stations, which account for eight of every 10 gallons of gasoline sold, was 92.79 cents a gallon for regular unleaded; $ 1.077 for premium unleaded and 89.41 cents a gallon for regular leaded. At full-serve pumps, the average price was $ 1.2078 a gallon for regular unleaded; $ 1.3057 for premium unleaded; and $ 1.1647 for regular unleaded.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the warring factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> opened informal talks Monday at the presidential palace in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> officials called it a `` coffee morning.'' No name plates or other identification labels were on the circular table where delegates from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and an alliance of <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance groups began negotiations in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, to end the bloody conflict. One of the rebel leaders on Sunday urged the other delegates to put aside politics, and then he knelt in prayer before three <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks. `` I believe strongly in this meeting as the best chance for a solution to the Cambodian problem,'' <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, a former Cambodian premier, told reporters at the airport following his arrival. The peace talks, hosted by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, mark the first time the rebels have sat down face-to-face with government leaders since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> nearly 10 years ago. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said the talks represented a chance for the parties involved `` not to think about political things, but only one thing: To put an end to the suffering of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people. If everyone thinks about that, then we will have good results.'' Since 1970, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has suffered a devastating five-year civil war, a reign of terror by the Chinese-backed communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from 1975 to 1978, a 1978 Vietnamese invasion and a continuing guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed government. Millions of people have been killed in the nation's turmoil. The heads of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s three rebel factions arrived Sunday in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. If the talk's make progress, officials from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations were to join in Wednesday. The informal, phased nature of the talks has been labeled `` cocktail party'' diplomacy. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, greeted the heads of the three guerrilla groups on Sunday. They were <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>. He was representing his father, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who quit the resistance leadership but remains perhaps the most popular figure in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Their adversaries _ <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> and the prime minister of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s government, <LOCATION> Hun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sen </LOCATION> _ arrived in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> Saturday. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has announced it will withdraw 50,000 troops, or about half its force in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, this year and the rest by early 1990. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said Sunday that he had asked <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, to ask people to pray for success of the talks in all mosques in their Moslem nations He said he had also asked Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to encourage prayers in Roman Catholic churches worldwide. He then knelt on the floor of the airport's VIP lounge, closed his eyes, and folded his hands to his forehead in prayer before three <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, who chanted blessings. The monks came from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to bless participants in the talks. Though Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> are allied with the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in a resistance coalition, they strongly distrust the group because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> resigned as president of the coalition earlier this month because he said <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> forces were killing his men. The prince, who ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for three decades, arrived Saturday in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> as a guest of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, but he said he would not attend the talks personally. In a recent interview with <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> media, <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> said all factions agreed that <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> would lead a future <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which first gave the world instant snapshots more than half a century ago, has been thrust into the public eye in 1988 by a series of high-stakes events that portend significant changes for the company. On Wall Street, analysts and arbitragers are fascinated by the possibility of an all-out takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, prompted by a hostile bid last week from a California-based investment group led by an heir to the Disney entertainment empire. In the courts, the outcome of a $ 5.7 billion patent infringement suit against rival <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> could have a major impact on <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock prices. And in its headquarters along the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, company officials are trimming the work force while preparing to challenge <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> and other film manufacturers with the worldwide introduction of conventional color film. Polaroid, with a reputation for extravagant research and uninspired marketing, now faces quick and important decisions. `` We're all waiting to see what happens,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Polaroid is hot right now.'' <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s tumultuous year began dramatically in late February with its $ 5.7 billion damage claim in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> patent suit. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> claims it lost $ 3.2 billion in sales and $ 2.5 billion in business opportunities after <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> entered the instant camera field in 1976. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> ruled in 1985 that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> violated seven Polaroid patents and ordered the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company to halt production of the instant film and camera. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> last month withdrew from the 12-year-old case due to family holdings of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> stock. The damages portion of the case is scheduled to be heard in January with a new judge presiding. Although <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> termed the damage claim `` ludicrous and ridiculously inflated,'' <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock has risen sharply from the mid - $ 20 range in anticipation of a decision in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s favor Polaroid closed at $ 40.75 a share Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, largely because of takeover talk. The company would welcome any award _ even the $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion many analysts predict _ following several years of lackluster performance. Polaroid camera sales have dropped nearly 50 percent from a high of 7.5 million in 1978, and the public has poorly received several new products, such as video film. Polaroid was formed in 1937 by Dr. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to develop and manufacture a synthetic light polarizing material he developed. Polaroid produced instant color photography in 1963 and made its most stunning achievement in 1972 with the release of the SX-70 system, which produced instant pictures outside the camera. It has made ventures in other market areas but with nowhere near the success of its breakthroughs in instant photography. Amid takeover rumors, the company on July 12 announced a reorganization plan highlighted by 500 to 800 layoffs and its entry into the $ 7 billion-a-year conventional film market. Company officials would not announce when the new film will be available outside <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, where it has been sold for two years in direct competition with industry leaders <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agfa-Gevaert </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd Meanwhile, the layoffs mark the latest in a decade-long reduction in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s work force, which has declined from more than 20,000 in 1978 to nearly 13,000. A company statement said most employees could select either early retirement or a severance plan that provided up to one year's salary. In addition, the company issued 10 million new shares into an employee stock ownership plan and launched a $ 300 million company stock repurchase effort. The move was interpreted as an effort to discourage takeover attempts. But less than a week later, <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a television and radio concern based in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, made a $ 40-per-share bid for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and filed suit in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> seeking to cancel the employee stock purchase plan. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, owned by the family of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> director and nephew of the famous animator, disclosed on July 20 it had acquired 4.93 million Polaroid shares as of May 11. Its takeover bid values the company at about $ 2.88 billion if all 71.9 million shares remain outstanding. However, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has indicated it might not proceed unless it manages to get the recent 10 million-share issue rolled back. In that case, the implied value of the bid would be $ 2.48 billion. Because <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> already owns a large block, its cost to buy the rest would be $ 2.28 billion, assuming defeat of the share issue, or $ 2.68 billion if the share issue is not defeated. According to <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> documents, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacAllister </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> refused to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year to discuss company strategies. Booth eventually consented to a July 13 meeting on condition that <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> would not acquire additional <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock, and <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> in turn take no action which might hurt <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s investment. The meeting was not held in the wake of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization announcement, which <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> termed a `` clear breach'' of its agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> The company said it would convene directors Tuesday to discuss the Shamrock bid. Some analysts are skeptical the 10-year-old Shamrock group could put together a deal of such magnitude. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> failed in a $ 92 million bid for <ORGANIZATION> Wherehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> video rental and music company. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> owns Music Plus, a 54-store music and video retail chain in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, in addition to three television stations and 14 radio stations. `` As far as I'm concerned it's a very shaky bid,'' said <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>. `` There seems to be too many conditions attatched to the offer ... It just seems out of their league.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Relyea </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> could have a major impact on investors if it could arrange a tender offer at a lower price with a promise to distribute any dividends to shareholders following resolution of the <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> suit. `` Say, for example, they got Polaroid for $ 30 a share,'' said <PERSON> Relyea </PERSON>. `` Well, that would set the damage award at about $ 10 a share, when right now no one can really say what effect it will have.'' The offer by <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> also could lure other suitors, hostile or friendly, into the bidding for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, analysts say.

<HEAD>Computer Company To Shut Down Some Plants Temporarily</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, faced with slower-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of mainframe computers, plans to shut down several plants temporarily and idle 7 percent of its work force the last week in August. The move will affect about 2,000 workers in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Arden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and about 500 employees in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Charland </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Computer Products Division, which makes mainframe computers. Employees will have a choice of taking accrued paid vacation during that week, or going without pay, <PERSON> Charland </PERSON> said Friday. Other divisions will not be affected by the shutdown, he said. The move will help consolidate vacation expenses in the third quarter, which will improve cash flow in the fourth quarter `` when we want to do well,' <PERSON> Charland </PERSON> said. `` It's hard to say what that means, because so much of our business is concentrated at the end of the year.'' <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> has closed some of its operations temporarily before, but this is the first time it has done so this year, <PERSON> Charland </PERSON> said. The most recent shutdown occurred last year in the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which makes military computers, he said.

<HEAD>Hunts Offer Debt Settlement For Placid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Hunt brothers' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil operation has offered to pay $ 803.5 million to settle the final step in a bitter two-year court battle between Hunt companies and banks that lent them $ 1.5 billion, according to company officials. The offer by <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> trust estates, includes cash repayments of $ 663.5 million over the next two months. The Hunts also would to pay the banks $ 140 million from Placid production revenues during the next seven years, company officials said Saturday. The plan, which is subject to approval by federal bankruptcy court, <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and major creditor groups, nearly would complete the settlement of the case and would remove Placid from bankruptcy protection. It also would leave the billionaire <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> brothers with only pieces of the vast petroleum-based empire amassed by their father, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> wildcatter H.L. Hunt. Late in June, the Hunt trusts and bank creditors agreed on a settlement to resolve issues surrounding some $ 760 million in loans to their <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>, the world's biggest independent offshore oil-drilling company, and <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> sued 23 of their lenders for fraud and misrepresentation in 1986 after defaulting on $ 1.5 billion in bank loans Two of the banks since have been dropped from the case. The suit sought $ 14 million in damages, alleging the banks conspired to drive <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> and Placid out of business by forcing them to agree to an unreasonable payment schedule while offering their competitors more favorable terms. In August 1986, the trust estates of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the trust partnership that owns <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION>. The reorganization plan proposed for Placid calls for sale of the Hunt brothers' interests in the 60-story Thanksgiving Tower, a downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office building, and disposal of Hunt production properties in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, transactions that are completed or pending. `` It depends on a number of large transactions,'' Hunt attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said of the proposal. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said one obstacle to conclusion of the settlement was the negotiation under way in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> for a loan of about $ 245 million, to be secured by <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, the Hunts' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> unit The Hunts already have paid $ 213.5 million of the proposed $ 663.5 million cash settlement from funds raised through Placid operations, primarily the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> unit, as part of cash collateral agreements with bank lenders, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Another $ 150 million was raised through sale of the Hunts' <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> oil and gas fields in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, he said. The brothers also plan to apply to the settlement their share of the $ 50 million in proceeds expected from pending sale of an 80 percent interest in Thanksgiving Tower. The planned sale of the building to <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking firm, should be complete by mid-August, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. He said completion of the loan agreement associated with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> assets could come by early September but was dependent on negotiations under way with mortgage lenders who must approve the transaction. The plan would leave the Hunts with <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION>'s successful North Sea operations and prospects in the Green Canyon sector of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Under the proposal to resolve the <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> loans, bank creditors would receive a $ 50 million payment and a $ 500 million secured note from <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION>, plus a 50 percent interest in the company if the Hunts fail to meet certain debt repayment deadlines. Some trust real estate will be transferred to the banks, subject to a $ 200 million purchase option. The <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> plan also must be approved by federal bankruptcy court.
