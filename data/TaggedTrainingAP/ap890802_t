The official Saudi press agency quoted `` a responsible source'' as saying <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> `` always condemns and denounces terrorist acts of all forms and of whatever methods ...

The Dubai-based <ORGANIZATION> Al-Bayan </ORGANIZATION> wrote in an editorial: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has flung the doors of hell wide open.'' `` What is the objective behind the Israeli act which can only be classified as organized state terrorism?'' asked <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> daily The hard-line newspaper Al-Khaleej, in neighboring <LOCATION> Sharjah </LOCATION> emirate, said `` the Zionist terrorist operation in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and its repercussions must be attributed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the region and the full and unconditional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bias toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>`Cheers,' `13 East' Lead NBC to 58th Consecutive Ratings Win</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> might have flopped with its nurse drama `` Nightingales,'' but its summer nurse comedy `` 13 East'' finished in the Top 10, helping the network win another Nielsen ratings derby victory. For the week ended July 30, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers'' landed in first place for the fourth time in five weeks, narrowly topping <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne. `` Cheers'' had a rating of 17.5, only one-tenth of a point ahead of `` Roseanne.'' Last week they tied for first place at 17.4. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> easily won the week for its 58th straight victory in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> survey. The only surprise in the Top 10 was the appearance of lightly regarded `` 13 East,'' which finished 10th. Other than CBS' `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder, She Wrote,'' all the shows in the Top 10 were comedies. The ratings are certainly proof of the resurgence of the situation comedy, which was all but written off a few years ago. Prime-time soap operas like `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Dynasty'' dominated the ratings until the appearance of `` The Cosby Show'' in 1984. In the 1983-84 season the only comedy in the Top 10 was <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Kate & amp; <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>.'' Comedy also dominated the second 10 highest-rated shows this past week with seven entries. Here are the Top 10: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Golden Girls'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes'' tied, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` Murder, She Wrote,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 13 East <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> continued its summer surge in the ratings. `` Married ... With Children'' was in 29th place, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' was tied for 34th and `` Totally Hidden Video'' was tied for 39th place. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was first with an average of 10.8, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second with 8.9 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was third with 8.7. The averages since the fall season began on Sept. 19 were: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 14.8, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 11.9 and CBS 11.8. The ratings is the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with television. The share is the percentage of sets in use. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> summer show, `` Knight and <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>,'' did not fare that well in the ratings. It was in 37th place. The lowest-rated show on the three networks was <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` American Nuclear.'' Here are the bottom five: CBS' `` Tour of Duty,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Trans-Antarctica Expedition'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` American Nuclear <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had the highest-rated evening news show. The ratings: CBS 9.0, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 8.8 and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 8.6.

<TEXT>
 An ex-sheriff's deputy held his former girlfriend hostage in a courtroom for nearly seven hours Tuesday, then killed himself and her, authorities said. Officials and bystanders heard two muffled shots at 9:45 p.m. from the courtroom where <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabano </PERSON> seized <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON>, a county clerk who had obtained a restraining order against Cabano the day before. Paramedics and sheriff's authorities then rushed in and found Cabano dead, with a gunshot wound to the head, and Ms. <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON> critically wounded. Ms. <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON> was taken to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, where she died at 10:17 p.m. while undergoing emergency surgery, said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, night administrator. Both victims were in their 40s. Cabano used a .44 - caliber pistol he'd taken to the courtroom in the suicide-murder, said <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cabano </PERSON> had also seized a .38 - caliber pistol from the justice of the peace in whose courtroom Ms. <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON> The gunman apparently went to Ms. <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON>'s home and opened her mail, finding court papers relating to the restraining order, before storming the courtroom, sheriff's officials said. The standoff began when <PERSON> Cabano </PERSON> grabbed the woman in Justice of the Peace <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON>'s first-floor courtroom at the <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> at about 3 p.m. Police negotiated with <PERSON> Cabano </PERSON>, sometimes through Ms. <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON>, via telephone during the standoff. Wise said talks with Cabano were improving about 8 p.m. and authorities thought the situation would end without bloodshed. `` Our hopes were building,'' he said. But then Ms. <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON> came on the line and `` she requested that she talk to her boys. That's always a bad sign.'' Wise did n't say whether Ms. <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON> was able to speak to her children. Police special weapons and tactics units were dispatched to the scene but left about 5 p.m., when the Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said they would take over, said <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. `` Judge <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON> said he worked with the man and knew him. The sheriff said he worked with him and knew him,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. A sheriff's department dispatcher who did not wish to be identified said <PERSON> Cabano </PERSON> `` worked here as a deputy years and years ago. He then became a bail bondsman until he went bankrupt about a year ago.'' Four of Ms. <PERSON> Hermosilla </PERSON>'s five children, some in their teens, rushed to the courthouse about 5 p.m., but were taken away by several of her co-workers. Police blocked off the area and evacuated about 300 people in the courthouse and the City Administration Building across the street.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has angered powerful political associates with a Cabinet shuffle that humiliated her longtime foreign secretary. It was not so much what she did on July 24 _ when 13 of the 22 Cabinet posts changed hands _ that has upset the hierarchy of the usually well-disciplined <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It was her manner of doing it that left wounds and resentments which, some analysts believe, could mark the beginning of <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s political end. `` Many of us found what went on nauseating,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs committee, said in a television interview. He spoke after news broke of how Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> moved aside Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s longest-serving foreign secretary since World War II, and replaced him with a virtual unknown, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON>. In the process, according to <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s aides, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> another senior, but less prestigious job as home secretary _ without consulting the incumbent, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, 62, turned that post down as a demotion after six years as foreign secretary. He settled for what Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office called the `` courtesy title'' of deputy prime minister and the job of government leader in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> also accepted residence in a country mansion, <LOCATION> Dorneywood </LOCATION>, which currently is used as a weekend retreat by the third member of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s top Cabinet trio, Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. `` This is how regimes behave when they have begun to take power for granted,'' commented <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Off the record, government ministers were quoted as complaining that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has held office for 10 years, committed a major blunder by humiliating or affronting all three of her top Cabinet colleagues. Some described the shakeup by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> _ who has sole power to appoint <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers from among her party's legislators _ as a `` shambles'' and said it reflected her increasing lack of regard for the Cabinet. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Downing Street office took the unusual step of announcing she supported <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> and would have kept him in an unspecified top job had <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> taken the job of home secretary. In the announcement, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also said there will be no more Cabinet shakeups before the next general election, which must be held by mid-1992 but could come earlier. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, who was cheered by sympathizers when he entered the Commons after the shuffle, hastily denied a newspaper report that he planned to run against Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for the party leadership. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> announced that the Cabinet was united. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, known to disagree with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on aspects of economic policy, said nothing. `` The Thatcher Cabinet is now more divided than ever before.. not on policy, but on personality. Either they are for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> or they are against Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochrane </PERSON> in the pro-conservative Mail on Sunday newspaper. `` She is lucky the long summer recess is now upon us ... but the summer wo n't last forever.

<TEXT>
 An army officer and 12 policemen have gone on trial for murder in an unprecedented prosecution initiated by parents of two boys shot to death in 1985 by officers hidden in crates on an unmarked truck. The parents decided last year to pursue the case on their own after the attorney general for <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> declined to prosecute the policemen despite a magistrate's finding of police negligence. The trial that opened Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is reportedly the first murder case to proceed under a law allowing private citizens to press a prosecution in certain instances where the government has declined. The 1985 confrontation, which occurred during anti-apartheid unrest in a mixed-race township near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, has become widely known as the `` Trojan Horse incident'' because white police gunmen concealed themselves in a what looked like an ordinary delivery truck. Footage of the incident was shown at the time on television news broadcasts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. According to evidence at the inquest, an army commandant and two senior police officers ordered the truck into the township of <LOCATION> Athlone </LOCATION> expecting it to be a target for stonethrowers. Gunfire from the concealed policemen killed <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Magmoed </PERSON>, 16; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Classens </PERSON>, 21, but the magistrate ruled there was no evidence that any of the three were among a handful of mixed-race youths who did throw stones. The officers in the crates popped out of the hiding places and fired 39 rounds of shotgun ammunition at the crowd, according to the evidence. The private prosecution was instituted by <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>'s mother and <PERSON> Magmoed </PERSON>'s father. Their lawyers are to be paid with proceeds from a fund set up last year which has received contributions from various overseas human rights organizations. Defense lawyers are being paid with public funds. The law providing for private prosecutions allows the defense to ask that the prosecutors pay the defendants' entire legal costs if the case ends in acquittal. At the start of Tuesday's proceedings, defense lawyers asked that the prosecution be ordered immediately to post a deposit of $ 360,000 to cover possible legal costs. The request was taken under consideration by the judge.

 <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> says the music and message of his solo group, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and The Mechanics, is becoming more defined and is distinctly different from Genesis, the pop group he helped found. `` I feel that with each album I'm getting away from Genesis,'' said <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>. `` There's a lot of influences that are coming through the Mechanics that have n't completely gotten out yet.

 Cuban-born state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> romped to the Republican nomination Tuesday in the race to succeed the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, while a Cuban-born former city commissioner and a prominent <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> attorney headed to a Democratic runoff. Attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> claimed momentum as he narrowly led a seven-candidate field in the ethnically diverse district. Former <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> city commissioner <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, also Cuban-born, had been the front-runner but was criticized for late negative campaigning. She ran just behind <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who in his stump speech said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> slot was `` an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> seat.'' Pepper's niece, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, fell short of the Aug. 15 runoff for the District 18 seat. `` It is really incredible,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, who was carrying nearly every precinct with 80 percent-plus totals. `` We're quite humbled and really flabbergasted We really just hoped for a victory without a runoff.'' Elections officials said turnout was best in the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> precincts. The Aug. 29 special election to fill the seat Pepper had held for the Democrats since 1962 could result in election of the first Cuban-American in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 Pepper, a liberal champion of the elderly and poor, drew no opposition in 1988.

The elections office said the district's 100,198 registered Democrats comprised 16,028 Hispanics, 32,183 blacks and 51,987 non-Latin whites. The 71,620 registered Republicans comprised 46,738 Hispanics, 23,656 non-Latin whites, and 1,226 blacks. But the figures for Hispanics are low, because the office counts only those who were born in Hispanic nations.

Portions were made available to The Clarion-Ledger in an agreement with the attorney general. <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON> told the newspaper Monday that he had nothing to do with the killings of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>. He also denied that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> paid him for information. <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said his client was tried on federal charges of conspiracy to violate the civil rights of the three men in 1967 and acquitted. `` Hey, look, you can write whatever you want to,'' <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarion-Ledger </PERSON>. `` I did n't have nothing to do with it. I'm not going to have anything to do with it now. `` I've been harassed for years and years on this mess. I do n't even want to talk to you about it,'' he said Commission investigator A.L. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' search for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant is contained in the commission's records. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> is dead. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> wrote a report on his investigation Aug. 6, 1964, two days after the three bodies were found in a grave at the base of a pond dam under construction on <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON>'s land southwest of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I have information from a confidential source ... that Mr. <PERSON> Olen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON>, a white male who owns the property where the bodies were found, and who operates a truck line out of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, is the informant who directed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to the spot,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said in the report. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> investigation, said Monday that <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON> never received money for information. `` I did n't pay any money to anybody,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in an interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home. `` I certainly do n't know anything about it.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said a freelance writer working on the case during the 44 days federal and state officials looked for the three had offered a reward of $ 25,000 for information leading to the bodies. `` That was the genesis of all the talk up there,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` I think he was affluent enough he could have paid the reward. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> file shows an informant led agents to the dam, but <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> refused to identify the individual. `` I have never named anybody, and I do n't want to.'' The commission was created by the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> on March 22, 1956, to preserve segregation in the state. The commission became inactive in 1973 when then-Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> vetoed its funding. The Legislature abolished the commission and ordered its files sealed for 50 years in 1977.

<HEAD>Leading Newspaper Chain Ends 40-Year Snub of East Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Since East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was founded 40 years ago, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest publishing chain has snubbed its socialist sibling by placing quotation marks around every reference to the state. But starting today, <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> newspapers and magazines will end the practice that has irked authorities in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> officials said. The quotation marks have cost the publishing empire journalistic accreditation in the neighboring socialist state and readership among much of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s left-leaning populace. But far from conceding defeat in the ideological battle, the publishers contend the war against the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> continues. `` The hope for reunification is unshaken,'' <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schell </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of the conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> wrote today. But, in light of changes in East-West relations, the barriers to improving the flow of information between the political blocs must fall, <PERSON> Schell </PERSON> said. The giant <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> publishing network includes <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest-circulation daily, Hamburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>, which sells nearly 5 million copies daily It also includes the influential <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenpost </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s Die Welt. Despite <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s broad audience, its journalists have been denied accreditation to work in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on the grounds that the company's editorial policies are insulting to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> government. A spokesman for the East German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the government had no immediate comment on <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s reversal. <PERSON> Schell </PERSON> hinted in his editorial that the newspaper considered the dropped quotation marks a step toward gaining permission to report from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Referring to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as `` DDR,'' the German abbreviation for <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demokratische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republik </ORGANIZATION>, was the protest of the publishing chain's founder, <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, who died nearly four years ago. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s division after World War II weighed heavily on <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, who moved his prospering business from his native <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in 1967. After construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, he put up a lighted readerboard to flash news from the West across the barrier. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> also issued political and moral guidelines for the publications in 1967, and the first and foremost called for the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. From the 1949 founding of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> publications refused to acknowledge the socialist government and the quotation marks demonstrated their disdain. Die Welt administrative chief <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Lueddeke </PERSON> said other West German publications also initially declined to acknowledge East German statehood, using similar quote marks or skeptical references to the government. But most dropped the practice after <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> recognized the east in 1970. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> editors concede now that the quotation marks have now lost their meaning and in some cases simply confuse readers. Circulation of <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>'s main dailies has fallen by as much as 10 percent over the past few years, and many attribute the drop to shifts within the West German populace toward detente with nations of the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. `` The number of people who can recall adult life in a unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is a minority,'' <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Schell </PERSON> wrote. `` With this step we come to grips with the developments in East and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, in particular the reform efforts in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Schell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Study: Working Women Sleep Less</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Working women sleep about 25 minutes less per night than their male counterparts, though the average woman sleeps slightly longer than the average man, researchers said Tuesday. `` Working women really take it in the neck. They sleep less,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamermesh </PERSON>, professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and one of the authors. `` One possible explanation is that a woman who works still has to maintain a lot of household duties,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON>, assistant professor of economics at the school. `` They are n't spending much less time doing those things, and their husbands are n't sharing chores with them, so the time has to come from somewhere and often it comes from sleep time.'' Mothers of children less than 3 years old get less sleep than the average person, but being parents to children younger than 3 does n't cut into the amount of sleep fathers get, <PERSON> Hamermesh </PERSON> said. The study of the sleep habits of 1,500 people also found that people who work sleep less than people who do n't work and that for every extra hour worked, a person sleeps 15 minutes less. The more a man works, the less sleep he gets, the report said. Men who earn a higher wage per hour sleep less than lower-paid men, but that pattern fails to hold up for women. `` One reason may be that women who are already working are sleeping less already and so the margin is gone,'' he said. <PERSON> Hamermesh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> gleaned the findings from reviewing information gathered in 1975-76 by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> survey research division. In 1980-81, 620 members of the study group were interviewed again. <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> said the time lapse since the data was collected should n't matter because lifestyles have n't changed significantly since then. `` Lifestyles and attitudes toward money and family are pretty much the same. Things like household habits are very slow to change,'' he said. Wide variances in the amount of time people sleep were turned up by the study. <PERSON> Hamermesh </PERSON> said 10 percent reported sleeping less than 6.5 hours a night and 10 percent reported sleeping more than 9 hours. `` Sleep is not something biologically fixed. People can substitute other activities for sleep,'' <PERSON> Hamermesh </PERSON> said. `` Although it's true we do need a certain amount of sleep, we do have some control,'' <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> said. `` How much time is valued is going to enter into that decision.''

 A case of mistaken identity landed a man in jail on his wedding day, and it took the word of the reverend who was to preside at the service to get him out. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carlstadt </LOCATION> said Tuesday he was riding with three friends on Route 4 about 3:15 a.m. Saturday when police stopped him at River Edge in northeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> because his car had a broken tail light. The officer checked <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>'s driver's license and found it was expired. The officer then checked to see if <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> had a record. A computer check showed a warrant for a <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, who was convicted in 1981 and 1986 on narcotics charges and was listed as a parole violator. The computer listed the wanted man's birthday as Aug. 15, 1962. <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>'s expired license showed the same birthday, landing him in jail. He told police they'd made a mistake. `` They said, ` That's fine, but we need proof,''' he said. <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, who described himself as a `` Bible-believing Christian'' and said he taught emotionally disturbed children in <LOCATION> Edgewater </LOCATION>, spent about 45 minutes alone in a jail cell. He said he sang `` songs to the Lord.'' While police checked his story, <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>'s friends rounded up character references for him.

<HEAD>Lucas Rejected; Could Get Civil Rights Job on Interim Basis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is weighing whether <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> could be named chief civil rights enforcer on an interim basis after his rejection by the Democrat-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The idea was raised by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., on Tuesday after <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' defeat in a pair of 7-7 votes that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> labeled `` raw politics. A spokesman said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is studying whether <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> could be given a recess appointment to the job after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' scheduled adjournment Friday. However, one White House official said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likely would not want to anger <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so early in his term by defying the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who was criticized by opponents as being unqualified to become assistant attorney general for civil rights. No new names for the position are under consideration while the legality of the recess appointment option is being explored, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s executive assistant. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and his top aides were surprised by the committee's action, saying they expected the nomination would be forwarded to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> where they thought <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> would win confirmation. A recess appointment would let <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> serve until the term of the current <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expires _ in 1990. The final decision on whether to go that route would be up to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, called the notion of a recess appointment a `` bad idea. Congressional and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a recess appointment would touch off a confrontation between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` In terms of where we go from here, we're now exploring our options,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who expressed disappointment over the vote. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> discussed the idea of a recess appointment with the White House. `` No decisions have been made, however, about either Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' future or how we might approach the job at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said Seven of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s eight Democratic members voted against <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, citing his lack of professional qualifications to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., joined the panel's six <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members in voting for <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> The committee also rejected, on an identical vote, a motion by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, to send <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> without a committee recommendation. Opponents argue that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 61, a black Detroit Republican who was sheriff and later chief executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, showed during his confirmation hearing that he was not familiar with civil rights law. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who has never tried a court case, acknowledged during the hearing that he was `` new to the law.'' `` He's lacking in experience and qualifications, his managerial accomplishments are debatable,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., who cast a crucial vote against confirmation But Republicans accused Democrats of racial hypocrisy by refusing to give <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> a chance to gain experience in the job. `` By rejecting him we are preaching one civil rights philosophy and practicing another,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, noting that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> would bring to the job his experience as a victim of racial discrimination. But <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> retorted that `` the greatest injustice is being done to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> because of what I think is the apparent cynicism of this administration.'' `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> adds up to a perfect foil,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said, `` A decent, honorable black man who has had a successful career, who has demonstrated he knows absolutely nothing about the law. I think that is cynicism in the extreme.''

<HEAD>Administration to Push for Greater Savings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is planning a fall offensive to call attention to the chronically low <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate, with officials holding out the possibility that thrifty Americans will be rewarded with increased tax incentives. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, aides said, will kick off the campaign with a series of speeches outlining the risks to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s global competitive position from low savings rates, which drive up the cost of capital for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses The personal savings rate, savings as a percent of after-tax income, fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and increased only slightly to 4.2 percent last year. By contrast, the savings rate in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was 16.5 percent in 1987. The administration is looking at a variety of possible solutions to the problem, ranging from broadening the tax savings offered by <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> to eliminating the double taxation on corporate dividends. The trouble is that such proposals to offer tax breaks to people who save would mean a tax loss of billions of dollars when the federal government is already straining to reduce huge budget deficits. But officials said it was likely that the administration would offer some changes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax law for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, testifying Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called boosting the low <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate `` the crucial issue for the long-term economic outlook of the country.'' Economists have long warned that the low personal savings rates, combined with the large federal budget deficits, were driving up interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and making it more expensive for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses to borrow money needed to expand and modernize. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, as he has done in the past, urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make reducing the federal budget deficit a top priority. But he said lawmakers should also consider ways to boost personal savings to expand the pool of available capital. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman noted that between the Civil War and World War I, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had the highest savings rate in the world, which helped supply the capital needed to transform the country into an industrial giant. While the personal savings rate had rebounded somewhat to 5.5 percent during the first six months of this year, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said more must be done to push the rate higher. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> were studying a variety of legislative proposals to boost savings, including the possibility of making changes in financial markets that would favor savers. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> said in an interview that the administration had a task force reviewing the savings issue and that one option being considered was revamping <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accounts, which were scaled back in the 1986 tax law. Also being studied, <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> said, are ways to eliminate the tax code inequity that makes it cheaper for corporations to borrow to finance expansions than to issue stock. If a corporation raises capital by borrowing, it can deduct its interest payments. But if it sells stock and distributes dividends on its profits, both it and the shareholders are taxed on those profits. <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would frame the issue in a series of speeches this fall as part of an overall need in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to focus more on long-term goals. He said the administration's push for a reduction in the capital gains rate would be included as one of the changes needed to lower the cost of capital to businesses. `` These are issues on which the secretary feels very strongly,'' <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> said. `` He is going to map out an agenda in some detail and with some coherence.'' In a preview of the initiative two weeks ago, White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> called in a speech for both public and private belt-tightening to cut budget deficits, increase productivity, improve the education system and make other necessary sacrifices to `` adequately address the future.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge who was reprimanded for ruling on two <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> cases while owning <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> stock said he will institute safeguards to prevent it from happening again. A judicial panel determined that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> violated the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Judicial Code of Ethics by ruling in the cases, according to documents obtained Tuesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The code requires judges to disqualify themselves from any case in which they have a personal or financial interest. In a letter, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, admonished <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> to `` increase your diligence in searching out any future possible conflicts'' but said no other action would be taken. `` Because the violation, unintended as it appears, gives an appearance of impropriety to the actions, we express our concern that they occurred,'' said <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, who oversees the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> district where <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> presides. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> could have faced suspension or a recommendation that he be impeached, but <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said those penalties would have been too harsh. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s rulings in the cases where he had holdings were reported by the AP on May 30. That report triggered the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> review. The <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is made up of the 11 active appeals judges in the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> and four district judges from the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, which covers <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Upon being notified of the conflict, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> publicly dismissed himself from the cases, an action that allows interested parties to reopen the cases. In a letter responding to the reprimand, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said he `` joined in the council's concern'' about the conflicts and `` instituted additional procedures and safeguards designed to prevent reoccurrence.'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> wrote he reviewed documents in both cases and `` I simply never connected up the defendant in each case with my investment. The responsibility and blame must rest solely on my shoulders.'' The AP discovered the conflicts by reviewing <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s annual financial disclosure statements and cross-referencing his stock holdings with his case files. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> review showed <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> has reported each year since 1985 that he has held between $ 15,000 and $ 50,000 in <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> stock. He presided over unrelated cases involving <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and 1989. In both cases, he ruled in favor of GE. In the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, lawyers are required to file a certificate identifying all interests in the case. Judges must then review that certificate and compare it against their financial records to make sure they do not have an interest.

 For <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, veteran speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, it was his tryout to be speaker _ with a small `` s.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> two months ago under an ethics cloud, found himself sharing billing Tuesday night with a comic juggler, a magician, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s daughter and a professional cat trainer. Such are the perils for the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat who, after a few weeks of rest from the trauma of his resignation, is setting out on the lecture trail. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s first stop was the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of program organizers and talent bookers who arrange speakers and entertainment for colleges, corporations and trade groups. IPA officials describe their forum as similar to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> draft, where the best talent is shown off and shopped around. To an outside observer, it more resembles a meat market. Speakers at the convention in a downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel all have the same idea, says <ORGANIZATION> IPA </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` They have something to say, and they want to be paid a buck for saying it.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s message was a simple one: the honor of politics as a profession, and of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where he served for 34 years, in particular. The 25-minute talk was punctuated with anecdotes about life on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s account of his well-meaning attempt to help a would-be <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bride get a 48-hour leave for her serviceman fiance so the two could be married. He received a telegram of effusive thanks from the woman, and one from the groom that said: `` Why do n't you mind your own damn business?'' The IPA, after sitting through days of speeches and acts, is a tough audience. Several of the professional critics said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> needed to punch up his routine a bit, perhaps adopting a more controversial topic. Others said he was better than expected _ for a politician. `` I think he'd be popular,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Antil </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's got insight into something we are all curious about. He had good emotion, use of quotations, range.'' But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellott </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lorain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said he'd be reluctant to book <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> because of the ethics controversy that forced him from office. `` He's going to be like <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. He'll be big in the corporate world and the redneck world where they wave the American flag a lot,'' <PERSON> Mellot </PERSON> said. Another veteran conventioneer said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will be `` good for a few months because he's still sort of a hot item, but it wo n't take long for the star to fade.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said his asking price will be $ 10,000 a speech, near the bottom of the range for top speakers these days, but five times the maximum he was allowed to accept for a speech while a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is getting upwards of $ 50,000 per appearance, and <PERSON> North </PERSON>, convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal, is paid a reported $ 25,000 per speech. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said his goal in starting a new career as a public speaker is `` to help people understand <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a little bit better and to awaken an interest in young people in public service.'' `` I'd like to overcome, to the degree possible, the cynicism that exists.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee charged him with 69 ethics violations, including allegedly using bulk sales of his book to evade limits on outside income, and improperly taking gifts from a developer friend who had a direct interest in legislation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> contended he was innocent of the charges.

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on the government's nuclear weapons program describes a pattern of shoddy waste management and hazardous conditions with contamination of ground water or soil at many plants. The findings were included in a detailed assessment Tuesday on what it will take to clean up the nuclear weapons plants after decades of environmental neglect by plant operators. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the first phase of the cleanup effort will cost $ 19.5 billion over the next five years with the overall cleanup likely to take at least 30 years. Overall cost estimates range from $ 90 billion to as much as $ 150 billion. The department's report listed numerous cases where shoddy handling of hazardous waste has contaminated ground water, posing various degrees of risk to surrounding communities. For example, according to the report: _ At the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, `` surface and ground water contamination'' was blamed on abandoned waste storage tanks Some public surface water was found to be contaminated and further `` potential health risks exist.'' _ Soil and ground water was found contaminated at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> uranium processing plant near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where wastes are buried in unlined pits and lagoons Some of the contaminated wastewater has been discharged into streams. _ Uranium dust has contaminated water at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> where spent nuclear fuel is recycled The report also warned of an `` immediate risk to employees through exposure to contaminated drinking water'' and said radiation exposure `` is a potential health risk'' to nearby property. _ Ground water also was cited at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, where particular concern was noted because of the facility's proximity to the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> _ Among other priorities was reducing ground water contamination at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and digging up barrels of liquid chemical waste at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site north of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> The report said ground water contaminants must be reduced at other federal nuclear facilities including the <LOCATION> Welden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> nuclear site in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> uranium processing plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, `` untreated liquid ... were sometimes discharged -LRB- into -RRB- canyons'' and radioactive wastes stored in various pits, trenches and shafts. As yet, the health risk of those actions `` can not be quantified,'' the report said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> outlined the department's proposed cleanup effort in a speech Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. He acknowledged `` the cost will be high'' and said even an optimistic timetable `` passes much of the burden to the next generation.'' The plan, which must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, calls for spending $ 2.4 billion next fiscal year. After that the annual bill is expected to steadily increase, peaking at more than $ 4 billion in both fiscal 1994 and 1995. The money would be used to clean up pollution where federal and state safety laws are violated, repair faulty equipment and develop new procedures and technology for future waste disposal, the department said. Most of the $ 19.5 billion will be used at 17 nuclear weapons plants in a dozen states as well as other nuclear facilities, most of which are inactive but continue to have hazardous waste problems. Among the sites considered most contaminated and getting the largest share of the cleanup money are: the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear complex in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, $ 4 billion; the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facility near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, $ 3.4 billion; the Oak Ridge Reservation complex in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, more than $ 2.7 billion; and the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, nearly $ 2.2 billion. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> criticized the plan, saying it `` provides for tradeoffs among compliance-related activities'' rather than a commitment to doing everything necessary to clean up the plants.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said he will press the states' chief executives to reach a `` consensus for change'' on education and the environment <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> outlined his goals at the end of a four-day meeting of the nation's governors Tuesday that produced few disagreements and a date to meet again late next month with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a domestic summit on education. Reflecting the quiet harmony of the conference, the governors unanimously approved a resolution urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president to impose a two-year moratorium on expansions in the Medicaid program that states would be required to finance. It also asks <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to consider restructuring the entire health care system, `` including federalization of Medicaid.'' States and the federal government currently share Medicaid costs, with the program administered by the individual states. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, a Republican who was named to a one-year term as chairman to replace Democrat <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said he would make the environment and education the focus of coming meetings of governors. `` We can not accept a future of declines in education and degradation of the environment,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` Governors can be the facilitators to bring about a consensus for change.'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a Republican, and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, a Democrat, will head the governors' preparations for the education meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. No site has been selected. Several governors voiced support for expanding health care coverage to more poor Americans, but said federal requirements that states pay for it were consuming their budgets. `` We do n't think it's fair for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take credit for doing things and then submit the bill to the states and say, ` You raise taxes to do it,''' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` We think the people that are going to be requiring things to happen also ought to show how it's going to be paid for That's responsible.'' Central to the governors' complaint is their argument that actions by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> requiring expanded Medicaid coverage for more people and for wider types of health care have forced states to pay most or all of the costs. The governors said that if current growth in Medicaid continues, spending by all states on the program will grow from $ 41 billion in 1986 to $ 104 billion by 1994. Medicaid, under these projections, will have grown from 6 percent of total state budgets to nearly 16 percent by that date. `` All these are worthwhile programs, but if we let this trend continue we're not going to have a budget to deal with,'' said Democratic Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The governors approved a series of other policy statements, few generating debate. Among them was a cautiously worded one urging the federal government to reduce the deficit without raising taxes `` if possible,'' while protecting key domestic spending and imposing a selective spending freeze _ in line with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policy. Meeting in private, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> elected <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> as its new president, when <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>'s term ends in January. The full governors conference elected Democrat <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as vice chairman, putting him in line to follow <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> as chairman next year.

<HEAD>USDA Report Shows Profits Rose Despite Drought But Fewer Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Average farm profits showed a modest increase last year despite the drought but fewer farms posted profits, according to a new study by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. `` Farmers depending on crop sales as a major source of farm income who incurred expenses for production and later were left with complete crop failure or severely reduced yields had lower profits or greater losses,'' the report said. `` Livestock producers within drought-plagued areas also were hurt, mostly by higher feed costs,'' according to the report issued this week. `` At the opposite extreme, producers managing to harvest crops or having large inventories benefited from higher market prices.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> study, the average net farm income increased by about $ 350, to $ 21,300, last year, marking a 1.5 percent increase over 1987. `` Average net farm income -LRB- profits -RRB- rose in 1988, despite the drought,'' the report said. `` However, the share of farms with negative income increased slightly from that of 1987.'' The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> credited higher earnings from crop and livestock sales for raising gross farm income `` despite lower direct government payments, more loan redemptions from the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and fewer net additions to crop and livestock inventories.'' Average expenses also rose, but not enough to override the expansion in gross farm income. Fewer farms were profitable in 1988 than 1987, the report said, noting that three out of four farms represented in the Farm Costs and Returns Survey were profitable last year. `` More than half of all farms -LRB- 53 percent -RRB- had positive net cash farm income in 1988, which was identical to that of 1986 but down 4 percentage points from that of 1987,'' the report said. Cash income in 1988 averaged $ 17,400, up $ 500 from 1987. Net farm income measures the longer term earnings of a farm business and is the difference between gross farm income and total expenses. Over time, this income measure shows the farm's ability to survive as a viable business. Net cash farm income measures the short-term cash earnings of a business and does not account for capital consumed in the production process. It shows whether the farm is covering all cash costs, such as interest, income taxes and principal payments. The report said fewer farms had relatively high levels of debt compared with assets, with 48 percent showing no outstanding liabilities at the end of 1988. That figure was 39.5 percent in 1984. `` Higher asset values, thanks to increases in land values and coupled with continuing efforts by farmers to avoid debt financing and reduce current debt lives, have resulted in a stronger solvency position for farmers,'' the report said.

 A Cuban-born conservative easily won the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat of the late <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> and looked forward to building up her campaign war chest while two Democrats face a tough runoff. `` I think the bloody fight is going to be between the Democrats. We're sailing on,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, who won 85 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary vote Tuesday against three opponents in a bid to become the first Cuban-American in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, prominent attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> claimed momentum heading into the Aug. 15 Democratic runoff as he edged <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, also Cuban-born. <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, niece of the liberal champion of the poor and elderly who had represented the diverse district since 1962, finished third. The <PERSON> Richman-Kennedy </PERSON> runoff promised to add ethnic rivalry to the heated competition for the district, which includes the heavily Cuban-American Little <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> area. `` My whole theme has been to unite the community,'' <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said. `` This should be an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> seat, with people voting for the most qualified candidate.'' `` I am a Cuban-American,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a former city commissioner. `` I'm also a woman. And I have represented all of the people of the city of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' In unofficial returns from all 146 precincts, Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, 36, had 16,952 votes, or 83 percent; fellow Cuban-American <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 57, had 2,261 votes, or 11 percent; insurance broker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON>, 54, had 698 votes, 3 percent, and evangelist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stembridge </PERSON>, 51, had 571 votes, or 3 percent. In the Democratic race, <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, 48, had 5,853 votes, or 28 percent, while Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 44, had 5,707 votes, or 27 percent. Ms. <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, 39, had 5,097 votes, or 24 percent. Four other candidates ran well behind. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who is Jewish, hoped to pick up the support of Ms. <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, who carried predominantly black precincts. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> dominated in predominantly Jewish <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> won strong support in Hispanic precincts. The elections office said the district's 100,198 registered Democrats comprised 16,028 Hispanics, 32,183 blacks and 51,987 non-Latin whites. The 71,620 registered Republicans comprised 46,738 Hispanics, 23,656 non-Latin whites, and 1,226 blacks. The figures for Hispanics count only those born in Hispanic nations. Unofficial estimates that include second-generation Hispanics run to about half of the registered voters. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> was angered by Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s mailings that attacked him for representing arms dealer <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON> <PERSON> Soghanalian </PERSON>, indicted on charges of illegally conspiring to smuggle combat helicopters to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> called <PERSON> Soghanalian </PERSON> a patriot who has helped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> causes. `` There has been some nasty negative campaigning that had me extremely upset,'' he said, but he added that his campaign, which started low in the polls, `` clearly has gained the momentum.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said she was n't worried about <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>'s late rush, saying the former <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president outspent her at the end on television and radio. Republicans were delighted at the nomination of Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, an educator who is married to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. `` I'm particularly grateful that the primary campaign was one that did not open wounds among Republicans,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> will get help from a fund-raising visit today by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Democratic chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agriculture subcommittee describes the government's cancellation of some farm export projects as an overreaction, saying the program has been handled like a covert operation. `` It's almost operated like a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operation,'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., said about the Export Enhancement Program `` I do n't want a stealth EEP.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, citing congressional leaks of sensitive information, said Tuesday that all projects approved but not announced under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> have been canceled. `` A list of proposals that had been approved but not announced was made public by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> yesterday -LRB- Monday -RRB- in a hearing. This information is market sensitive and was not authorized for release,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, undersecretary for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. The export subsidy program has operated since 1985 to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities competitive in targeted markets where foreign competitors _ especially the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> _ intrude with subsidized sales of their own. About 65 countries, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, have been designated for subsidized sales. Under the program, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agriculture subcommittee Monday that the program has succeeded in boosting farm exports. In response to questions by subcommittee members, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> gave the panel a list of export subsidy proposals, some of which had not been announced. The list, which was classified, could enable foreign competitors to seek out the intended buyers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods overseas and offer better deals, an official said. `` If information is released prior to the announcement of a decision, then the effectiveness of the program dissipates and the ultimate cost is borne by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers by making it more difficult to compete in markets abroad,'' <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee, said in an interview that `` the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily handed over the document to us. It became a public document.'' `` He is overreacting,'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>. `` He's also inexperienced. But he is an honest, decent guy.'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, who said he planned to meet Friday with <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, sent a letter acknowledging that the incident was `` unfortunate'' and `` should n't have happended.'' Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, said the incident began when he asked <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was interested in buying soybean oil from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> said he did n't know and asked the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which led to the distribution of the sheets that included rejected projects. `` Obviously he -LRB- <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> -RRB- does n't want this list out,'' <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON> said. `` They do n't want to admit they have n't been taking advantage of sales opportunities and have been rejecting programs.'' <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON> said the papers showed rejections to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> for 200,000 tons of wheat, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> for 700,000 tons of wheat, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for 500,000 tons of wheat and to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for 16,000 tons of rice. But Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, R-Mo., an agriculture committee member who was not at Monday's hearing, blamed <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON> and said the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no choice but to cancel the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> projects `` It is hard to quarrel with what they have done because it could have adverse effects on the market,'' he said. `` It is incumbent on the members to be a little more sensitive to tossing this information around.''

 Foreign ministers hoping to clear a path to peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> went home after a ringing round of speeches, leaving deputies to hack through almost impenetrable underbrush. Even if four disparate <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> factions reach an accord, allowing internationally supervised steps toward reconstruction, good intention must stand the test of political reality. `` A lot of delegates express optimism, but I do n't think very many of them are optimistic,'' a Japanese official said before a month of committee work began Tuesday. The crucial obstacle is what to do about the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, no mere negotiating point to any Cambodian who left his family on the killing fields. Front-page cartoons in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> keep fresh the memory of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s regime of the 1970s, in which at least 300,000 people were executed or starved in class purges. Tuesday's drawing showed one Cambodian telling others: `` I propose we forget our little differences.'' They sat at a table engulfed by a vast sea of skulls. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> sat impassively in the hall, taking his turn at the rostrum to denounce subsequent Vietnamese crimes in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as equal to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s. Speaker after speaker rejected any <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> role in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s long-term future, but aides acknowledged privately it was not likely the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would go away. Even <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> endorsed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> participation in a transitory coalition, regarding that as a necessary evil to remove <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from the scene. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s role was another imponderable. Vietnamese authorities pledged to evacuate their last troops by Sept. 27, whatever the 19-nation <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference decided in month-long deliberations. `` Will the Vietnamese really get out, even if they remove their troops?'' reflected <PERSON> Lek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> historian who helps edit the London-based Index on Censorship. `` I do n't believe it. We have jungles, sanctuaries.'' Other expert observers disagreed with <ORGANIZATION> Lek </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s lingering presence would be noted, endangering its basic purpose of improving its international image and attracting more aid. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> assured goodwill, mugging for reporters in a surreal counterpoint to the grim business at hand. He said his Chinese colleague was cordial, modifying <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s harsh tone toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> `` We shook hands,'' he said. `` Did we look at each other and go like this?'' He closed his eyes and stuck out his tongue. `` No, no.'' Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> occupied a pivotal role at the conference, as he has since his neutralist government crumbled two decades ago after the Vietnam War spilled across his borders. Flitting between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, he has rallied support for his embattled nation, held together by a rich ancient culture that has absorbed and then shrugged off foreign intrusion throughout history. Still, his popularity is not boundless. Many Cambodians remember his reign as tainted by profligate relatives of the colorful prince who, they say, played the saxophone while <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> burned. Some Cambodian experts see a likely compromise, if any is forged, will be a symbolic role for <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> under a government sympathetic to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> making war at the edges. As the conference shifted into grinding low gear, Western and Cambodian analysts agreed that one of the few concrete results was a backhand byproduct: In the past few months, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> prime minister who was widely spurned as a puppet of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, has been tacitly legitimatized as leader of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He is in a position to hold power while waiting for support to wane for <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and for <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION>, a pro-Western resistance leader in tenuous control of his forces. Despite the obstacles, most of the world is anxious to press for some sort of settlement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> see it as a costly, dangerous flashpoint in a world with enough problems. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wants to rebuild <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> but can not without a stable internal framework. And the six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> have been trying for a decade to get <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to go home and allow the Cambodians to find some level of co-existence. Outside nations hope a thaw in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> will melt away settlements of 300,000 refugees along the Thai border, not only a human tragedy but also a political tinderbox. Beyond the internal issues at the heart of the Cambodian problem, nations differ over the international structure to supervise the peace. Some insist that Cambodians should resolve their own problems at their own pace. Canadian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, among others, argued that the international effort has to be part of a comprehensive settlement, including agreement among the Cambodians. `` There has to be a peace to keep,'' he said. He added what many Cambodian experts considered to be a understatement: This will be the most complex peacekeeping operation since the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> says it is risking social unrest, rising unemployment and a possible backlash from the conservative right in its push toward a free-market economy. The government, in a memo Tuesday to a 24-nation conference on aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said it is determined to change its state-controlled economy `` even if it initially causes social conflicts.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> warned, however, of widespread opposition if its campaign resulted in a sharp and sustained fall in the standard of living of the country's 11 million people. It urged more than 130 officials attending the meeting at the headquarters of the European Community for financial aid. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is about $ 18 billion, the highest per capita in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> The memo said the government was seeking as much as $ 3 billion in new Western assistance from 1990 to 1992. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other key world leaders called for the meeting to draw up a Western aid package that would encourage democratic change and economic reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. They also urged emergency food shipments for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. At the one-day talks, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledged an additional $ 50 million in food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, beginning Oct. 1, to help ease the shortages caused by that government's moves toward a free-market economy. `` We're trying to help carry them through this period,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON>, deputy assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State for European Affairs, told reporters. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> also promised food aid. The European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc, earlier agreed to send $ 120 million worth of meat, grains and other products to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Shortly after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip last month to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> announced it would send $ 9 million in food from surplus stocks. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Tuesday ended price controls and meat rationing as part of the current economic reforms. There was concern the abrupt lifting of price controls might send the country into turmoil. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, has been in the forefront of economic reforms in the Communist bloc since the 1960s. The push has recently accelerated. The government's memo said the key goal was for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to become `` an equal member of the community of the developed democratic nations.'' To do so, it wants to create a market economy `` based on the equality of the different forms of ownership'' and integrated in the world economy with a currency that can be traded internationally. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s currency, like those of other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations, does not circulate in world currency markets. `` Parallel with our efforts aimed at creation of the market economy, economic policy must also be radically changed,'' the memo said. The reforms, it said, require tight monetary and budget policies that can lead to poor economic growth and higher inflation. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> said its balance of payments _ a summing up of international trade payments _ was expected to `` deteriorate'' in 1989. Moreover, it forecast a higher jobless rate due partly to shutdowns of money-losing companies. `` Although unemployment is not yet considerable, its rate is gradually growing,'' it said, cautioning it could lead `` to serious problems in certain regions.'' It invited the nations attending the aid conference to meet in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> next month to take a closer look at <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s situation. Nations at the meeting were the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> members of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. Others present were the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Health Official Says Congress Responsible for Providing AIDS Funding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must share the responsibility in the battle against AIDS by appropriating money for all the programs it says must be implemented, a federal health official says. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, assistant secretary for health at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> often fails to provide additional money to pay for programs it authorizes. `` We have been getting very clear guidance except when we get an authorization without an appropriation,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee grilling him Tuesday about spending on AIDS treatment. `` It would be helpful if you folks would provide leadership,'' shot back Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee. Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the department wo n't get a larger share of limited federal funds `` unless the department is going to squeak a lot louder. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON> represent the two cities _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> _ with the largest AIDS populations. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> before being selected by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> job, said he shares responsibility for the entire <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> budget, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` What is enough -LRB- for AIDS -RRB-?'' he asked rhetorically. `` We ca n't drop infant mortality or cancer We could drop any other of these and do more on AIDS but I do n't think that is what the nation wants us to do.'' Moreover, he said, there are problems even within the AIDS appropriations provided by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. For example, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized $ 15 million last fall to help pay for AZT administered to patients who could n't afford it during the current fiscal year AZT, which costs several thousand dollars a year per patient, is the only approved drug treatment for AIDS. However, the authorization did n't carry with it a new appropriation to replace the appropriation that had been used up, leaving <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> officials with the choice of ignoring <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' directive to continue paying for the drug or dipping into other AIDS budget accounts to come up with the $ 15 million <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said he was facing the same problem that his predecessor did because the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> budget approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> contains about $ 1.6 billion for AIDS, but nothing to specifically cover the $ 30 million authorized for AZT payments during the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. `` The only place I can find that is to take it out of prevention or biomedical research,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` Someone has to make a priority decision.'' The human resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Government Operations, which held Tuesday's hearing, does n't have jurisdiction of legislation either authorizing HHS programs or appropriating money for them.

<HEAD>Aquino Signs Bill Giving Greater Autonomy to Moslem Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has signed a bill granting regional autonomy for <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island, a law the government claims fulfills its pledge for self-rule in largely Moslem areas of the country. `` We have kept the faith with the constitution,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` To be meaningful, autonomy must translate into the more effective delivery of government services.'' Under the measure, the autonomous region will have its own governor and legislature and will have control over regional affairs except for national defense, foreign relations, judiciary, postal and customs. Rep. <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cainglet </PERSON>, one of the bill's sponsors, said voters in each of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>'s province will be asked in a plebiscite within 90 to 120 days whether they want to join the autonomous region. Provinces will be included in the area only if a majority of the voters agree, he said. The new Philippine Constitution provides for autonomy for `` Moslem <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>,'' although most of the island's population is Christian. Moslem rebels have rejected the government's proposal because it allegedly does not go far enough in the self-rule formula. Moslems make up about 5 percent of the country's 58 million people.

<HEAD>Bennett's Drug Strategy Short on Specifics, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s national drug strategy calls for increased law enforcement but is short on specifics, according to administration officials who have seen it. While the program focuses on cocaine, particularly crack, it has `` virtually nothing'' on heroin, dangerous prescription drugs that are diverted to illegal use or hallucinogens, said one source. `` There's only one sentence on all of that,'' the source said Tuesday. The strategy report to the Cabinet, required by the 1988 anti-drug law that created the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION>, strongly reflects public comments made by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> since he took office five months ago. The final report is due Sept. 5. `` It reads like one of his speeches,'' said one source. Another source said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> wrote the strategy himself after gathering information from government agencies and drug experts. All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The strategy calls for an all-out effort to eradicate domestic marijuana crops and to wipe out money-laundering operations, but it says nothing about domestic methamphetamine labs, one source said. However, the source said there were few specific goals _ such as the number of drug-treatment beds the nation should have by 1991 _ in the draft submitted Monday. The only goals included were that drug-related admissions to emergency rooms and the drug use found by the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse should be reduced by 10 percent in two years and by 50 percent in 10 years, according to one of the sources. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> warned last week that the strategy would contain `` some carrots and some sticks. `` We will expect states to do certain things if they want federal funds,'' he said then. `` We will expect educational institutions to finally do certain things if they want education funds.'' In the most recent draft, those threats take the form of a possible loss of highway funds for states that fail to revoke driver's licenses from those convicted of drug offenses, and a possible loss of federal education funds from schools that fail to have Education Department approved drug-prevention programs and policies, a source said. Threats in an earlier draft to revoke criminal justice funds were eliminated, the source said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who spent eight years pushing for creation of the job, said during <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing that he expected the strategy to include detailed goals One source said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> planned to meet with senators in the next few days, possibly to reduce expectations. The strategy seen by the sources did not include matters such as international operations and interdiction efforts, which are included in a separate, classified document being reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The non-classified strategy, under review by the <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, reflects <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s oft-stated contention that the drug war must be aggressively fought on all fronts _ enforcement, prevention and treatment. `` No single strategy, pursued alone or to the detriment of other possible and valuable initiatives, can work to contain or reduce drug use,'' the strategy says. But what that means in terms of money was not immediately clear. The draft strategy circulated Monday included no budget figures. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in June that he expected to seek more money for drug treatment and probably more for prevention. He said last week that the escalating cost of the drug war may eventually lead to the need for a tax increase. The strategy stresses a need to rid inner cities of illegal drugs. `` A paramount target of law-enforcement activity, especially at the local level, must be the disruption of those street markets for drugs in which retail demand and supply finally meet in a combustible mix.'' It includes proposed anti-drug legislation for states that closely resembles outlines <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> provided two weeks ago to a gathering of state legislators, according to one source. The policies <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> urged on the state legislators ranged from hiring more police, judges and prosecutors and building more prisons, to imposing civil fines of up to $ 10,000 for those convicted of possessing small amounts of drugs.

 The dollar ended lower against the Japanese yen Wednesday, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ended with a marginal gain after erasing most of its early upward momentum.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is being warned not to bet the farm on high-definition television. Despite what its proponents say about the dazzling new technology, HDTV wo n't play a significant role in a growing electronics market in the next 20 years, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report Tuesday. The report, which may take some of the wind out of the <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> sails in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said: _ HDTV advocates have made `` very optimistic'' forecasts about the market size and easy availability of the next generation of video _ Even under the rosiest of scenarios, HDTV sales will be small relative to other electronic equipment markets _ It is questionable how quickly _ or if _ finicky consumers will accept <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION>, even though it promises 35mm motion picture quality images, particularly if there are intermediate and cheaper types of advanced TV receivers available _ The total world market for electronic equipment grew by $ 54 billion in 1988 to reach $ 461 billion, and the world market for <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> receivers and VCRs is forecast to be less than $ 30 billion by 2010 _ HDTV will spur only marginal production of sophisticated memory chips, which are widely used in other applications even now `` It seems counterintuitive to suggest that such a small market that may exist in the future is a more important driver of economies of scale, technology and competitive success than is the growth in the present market.'' the report said. `` It would be a case of the tail wagging the dog.'' But the report, written by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webre </PERSON>, said government support of HDTV might be justified because of increased employment, national prestige or scientific advancement. The report was introduced at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is considering a possible government role in fostering the growth of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high-definition TV industry. Proponents say a quick government decision is vital in overcoming the Japanese and European lead in the HDTV arena. Committee Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to pre-empt foreign competition so HDTV wo n't become another U.S.-invented product that is sold back to Americans from overseas. Despite the report, the HDTV juggernaut rolled along Tuesday on several congressional fronts. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave voice vote approval to a $ 305 million authorization bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> new </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1990 that includes $ 37.5 million for federal <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> research and seed money for private HDTV consortia. The bill was amended to allow foreign companies to participate in the <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> research consortia and a provision for $ 50 million in loan guarantees was dropped. Also, a House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee approved an amendment to the technology authorization bill to provide $ 100 million annually for three years for creating public-private consortia for HDTV development. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, applauded the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> report, saying it would help shift the discussion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness away from just <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> to `` the need to find solutions for major economy-wide problems of primary importance to national competitiveness.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the report was narrowly focused on <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION>'s potential use in home TV receivers. HDTV, he said, would be a far more important technology driver in engineering work stations and high-end personal computers and for development of better manufacturing techniques. The association has proposed a package of federal support for <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> that would include $ 1 billion in loans and loan guarantees for manufacturing facilities and $ 300 million over three years to expand the $ 30 million already allocated to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for HDTV research. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy assistant secretary for science and electronics, reiterated the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's proposal to spur HDTV through lower capital gains taxes, a permanent <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; D tax credit and possible antitrust exemption for joint industry ventures

<HEAD>House Passes TV Antitrust Exemption to Encourage Self-Regulation
on Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The television industry may be getting a chance to adopt voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing violent programming. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 399-18 Tuesday to give television networks, local stations, producers and the cable TV industry a three-year antitrust exemption to work up guidelines for depicting non-news violence on television. The vote sent the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which passed a similar bill May 31. At present, such discussions would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, which caused the demise of previous industry self-regulation under the Television Code of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill was approved with an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, that also would allow the TV industry to discuss ways to curb scenes that glorify drug use and portray sexually explicit material. A <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee will have to work out differences in the two bills, which probably wo n't take place until after the August congressional recess expected to begin Friday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bill's chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proponent, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not indicated he opposed the measure and was expected to sign it when it reaches his desk `` This is indirect censorship, pure and simple,'' Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., said during debate on the bill Monday night But one of the authors of the measure, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., said the legislation was necessary in a TV age in which, `` conservatively, children are exposed to 12,000 violent acts a year'' on television `` I believe the television industry wants to accept a degree of help'' to allow them to deal with the problem, <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said, adding that `` constitutional experts who testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said this bill did not conflict with the First Amendment.'' Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., a cosponsor of the bill, said he had changed his mind `` Now I have concluded that it is a mistake,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. `` The notion that the ` wildings' of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the crime rate of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> ... are a direct or even a partial result of violent television is a dubious notion at best.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> twice before has passed similar legislation sponsored by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has said `` overwhelming'' evidence exists that TV violence contributes to aggressive and destructive behavior in viewers. Both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills died when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed to pass them. House legislation had been bottled up in the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> under then-Committee Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, D-N. But the TV violence bill passed out of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee this year under a new chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Broadcasters, aware that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could impose mandatory restraints, have supported the legislation, but are concerned that they would be vulnerable to lawsuits from anyone they did not include in the talks on curbing violence. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has called the legislation a `` Trojan horse'' that could open the door for eventual government censorship of TV.

<HEAD>Bush's Clean-Air Bill Best Hope for Breaking Stalemate: Industry
Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean-air bill could cost businesses and consumers money but it remains the best hope for breaking a decade-long stalemate, a coalition of the nation's major industries says. `` There is no gift here _ for consumers, workers or businesses,'' coalition administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said Tuesday in answer to environmental groups that contend the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal is a sellout to industry. Representatives of the petroleum, chemical and auto industries, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> group, offered a mixed review of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan at a news conference. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said the legislation would dramatically control acid rain, tighten auto and truck emission standards, force some cities to adopt an alternative motor fuels program and cut ozone emissions and airborne toxic chemicals. But some of the measures, <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said, would go too far in slashing industry profits, hurting competitiveness and costing consumers money when pollution control costs are passed on. The industry representatives criticized two cornerstones of the legislation: use of alternative fuels for some motor vehicles sold in severely polluted cities, and a cap on sulfur-dioxide emissions that would prevent utilities from expanding when demand for electricity is rising. Sulfur dioxide is the main component of acid rain, which has destroyed trees and lakes in the northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Despite the criticism, <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan should be `` the basic legislative text from which a final bill will be drawn.'' It `` addresses serious issues such as ozone ... and toxic air pollution,'' he said. `` And the president has made a serious effort to consider costs and build flexibility into the bill.'' The bill, <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said, is a much better alternative than competing bills backed by environmental groups. Those bills would give industry far fewer choices in devising ways to improve air quality. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> and other industry representatives say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s original annual cost estimate of $ 14 billion to $ 19 billion would be far too low and would cause layoffs because of expense to industry. He would n't predict how many jobs would be lost or give industry's estimate of the cost. The provisions that upset the industry group the most have been cited again and again by administration officials as cornerstones of the legislation. The alternative fuels plan would require that in areas with severe ozone pollution, at least nine cities, vehicles with clean-burning fuel must be sold according to the following schedule: 500,000 in the 1995 model year; 750,000 in the 1996 model year; and 1 million in each of the model years from 1997 through 2004. `` We're suggesting the mandate should not be there'' because automakers are n't certain the technology is perfected or that consumers would accept the cars, <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a lobbyist with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said his oil industry trade group believes the proposal to be `` a big mistake,'' saying `` there should be a level playing field in which all fuels should be able to compete.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has most-often mentioned methanol as the likely alternative fuel, a product made from natural gas that likely would come from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He contended the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be biased against giving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum companies the chance to produce a cleaner-burning gasoline. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan also would reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of 2000, based on 1980 levels. But the measure also would `` cap'' emissions at the reduced level, thus restricting growth of utilities unless they could further reduce their emissions from existing plants. The cap on such emissions, <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said, `` is unnecessarily restrictive, limits economic growth, and makes it difficult to build new factories and power plants.''

<HEAD>Political Scientist Michael Harrington Dies at 61</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, remembered as the `` conscience of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' who inspired such leaders as the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> with books about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poor, has died of cancer at 61. The political theorist and longtime activist died Monday night at his home in suburban <LOCATION> Larchmont </LOCATION>. The death was announced Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, where he was a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. He wrote 16 books on the problems of massive poverty in the midst of affluence and on the cultural stress associated with technological advance. In a 1987 interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> recalled how key individuals, including King and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, seized upon his book, `` The Other America: Poverty in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' to rally for the federal war on poverty. `` The luck was that the book came out at a time when there was a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who read books, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and he read it,'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said. `` It led him to decide to make poverty an issue in the 1964 campaign. `` He was killed before he could do it but that set in motion the process that led <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to declare war on poverty.'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> also was active in the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement and the movements against apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He grew up in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in a middle-class family that fared well financially even during the Great Depression. He became attracted to socialism while at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which he attended for a year. But <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> did not come face-to-face with poverty until he went to work as a social worker for the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, a job he got through political pull. `` It was a rainy day where I walked into a building and all the doors and windows were closed. And the building stank so much that I almost got nauseous, because all of the smells of the backed up toilets and the dead rats and the cooking smells of a hundred years were all there,'' he recalled in the interview. `` At that moment I said to myself, this is something I better spend the rest of my life trying to abolish.'' City University Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>'s intellectual energy, dynamism, and social commitment enriched an entire generation. `` He was the conscience of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a champion of the downtrodden and afflicted.'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> was a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, serving as national chairman and co-chairman from 1982 until his death. He was secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, a chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from 1968 to 1972 and of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from 1973 to 1982. He was also a member of the Senior Seminar of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. His latest book, `` Socialism, Past and Future,'' was published by <ORGANIZATION> Arcade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last month. Referring to `` The Other <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON>, editor of The Nation, to which <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> contributed for more than 20 years, said: `` It was one of the very few times that a book led to a federal program, the war on poverty ... `` Ever since then there's been a new consciousness that we should do something about poor people. `` He managed to use the ` S' word and call himself a socialist and still have access to the mainstream media and political parties.'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> taught at the universities of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as well as at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> received his bachelor's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, fighting to remain on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bench, says he had nothing to do with a plot to get a $ 150,000 bribe in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> racketeering case. `` No, sir,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said Tuesday under questioning by his attorney about the plot to get the $ 150,000 bribe. The first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a year ago on charges of plotting to elicit a bribe, lying to the 1983 jury that acquitted him of that charge and improper disclosure of information from a federal wiretap. A 12-member panel is gathering evidence for the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before it votes on whether to impeach him and deprive him of his $ 89,500 annual salary. Also Tuesday, the panel voted unanimously to move disbarred <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> a step closer to being held in contempt and perhaps jailed for refusing to testify. Borders, convicted and imprisoned for 33 months in the case, refused twice last week to testify, asserting his right against self-incrimination. The committee contends that he ca n't refuse to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds because he already has been granted immunity. The next step would put the issue before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and then a court. Taking the stand in his defense, the 52-year-old <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> offered an explanation for one of the key points being used against him. He said he appeared for dinner at 8 p.m. Sept. 16, 1981, in the dining room of the <LOCATION> Fontainebleau </LOCATION> hotel in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Earlier, Borders had promised to produce <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in the dining room at that time on that date. The idea was to prove Borders could influence the judge and thus encourage a payoff from a man he believed to be a defendant trying to buy his way out of a three-year racketeering sentence. Unknown to Borders, he was talking to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent wearing a hidden tape recorder. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said he went to the hotel that night with a date because Borders had suggested that he would meet him there. However, Borders was in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hasting </PERSON> said he was n't surprised that Borders did n't show up. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has always maintained that Borders, a longtime friend and law school classmate, was a `` rainmaker'' who boasted of influence he did n't actually have as a means of drumming up clients. The judge also offered an explanation for behavior prosecutors say suggests an effort to elude the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 9, 1981, the day Borders was arrested as he drove out of a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> motel with a garment bag stuffed with cash and undercover agent <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> by his side. That day, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was staying at the L'Enfant Plaza hotel in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, preparing for a testimonial dinner in honor of Borders, then a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Told of the Borders' arrest, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> quickly left for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and went miles out of his way to <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to catch a plane when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was only minutes away. `` I went there to get a flight that I thought would get me to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> testified. `` I really expected to see the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> at the National Airport, the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> airport or <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>.'' Agents found him later that night in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> at a friend's home.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to avoid endangering <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as this country uses diplomacy _ and hints at military retaliation as an option _ to try to secure their release. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, now strengthening its ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, readily agreed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for help. Arab governments and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> also were enlisted Tuesday in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic campaign to get through to pro-Iranian factions that hold the Americans captive. The hostages' status appeared to be newly imperiled after <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists claimed Monday to have hanged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to free a cleric it accuses of involvement in terrorist actions, including <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' kidnapping last year. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s offer to swap Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and two other captives for all foreign hostages, including three Israelis, was spurned by the militant organization known as <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent a strongly worded message to nations in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ on behalf of the hostages. `` We expect those who have influence over the hostage takers to exert that influence,'' said one official, who spoke on condition he not be identified. While no pressure was brought to bear on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ and no demands made for the release of the cleric _ the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is urging <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders not to take any action that might threaten the other eight American hostages, diplomatic sources said late Tuesday. In a series of fast-paced meetings with leaders of the Israeli government in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, American Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> asked that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> be kept informed of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s actions in the future, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and diplomatic sources who demanded anonymity. Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> took with him on a previously scheduled trip to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeal that he urge <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to arrange the release of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviets denounced as `` inhuman'' the reported execution of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had aggravated the situation by abducting the sheik and registered concern over `` an escalation of acts of violence and terror.'' Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials hoped <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> might be influential with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the hostages. The Soviets were approached while Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> attended a conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> last weekend in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. And in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he asked Soviet diplomat <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozyrev </PERSON> at a meeting Tuesday on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` use its good offices to influence the Iranian government to bring about their -LRB- the hostages' -RRB- safe and immediate release.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military retaliation, as an option, was raised at the White House. An administration source said Tuesday it was `` in the realm of the possible.'' Apart from other considerations, though, the fact that the hostages' captors shuttle them frequently from house to house in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and live among women and children in slums and camps makes targeting the captors difficult. The immediate concern, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other diplomatic sources said, was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, a 58-year-old comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> whose execution was threatened for Tuesday, then put off. Intrigued by the reprieve, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials left open the possibility it was prompted by Iranian intervention. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to release <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. She cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy against dealing with or making concessions to terrorists. `` No, we have not because you know our longstanding policy on hostages, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> understands the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on the matter of hostages,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 After raising expectations of dramatic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action to prevent the killing of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is shifting gears, trying to dispel notions of an administration gripped by crisis or scrambling to launch a military strike. To underscore an appearance of near-normalcy, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pointedly refused to cancel plans Tuesday night for a barbecue dinner on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, complete with country music. While acknowledging `` these are not easy days,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> smiled and clapped his hands to the tunes of the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> and thanked them for bringing a `` touch of joy, touch of brightness'' to the White House. The president told his guests that `` even though there are complicated times, I think an evening like this of just plain relaxation with friends is very, very significant and very important.'' It was a different message on Monday when a grim-faced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cut short a cross-country trip and hurried back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, denouncing the `` brutal murder'' of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> by kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Taking a page out of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s playbook, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summoned his top military, national security and foreign policy advisers to a White House meeting. That was followed by an evening briefing by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, that kind of scenario suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was about to do something dramatic, such as a bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> or air strikes against Libyan oil platforms. However, in this instance, military action was put on the back burner while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration pursued a diplomatic solution. An administration source said a rescue operation for the hostages or a military strike were `` not attractive options.'' With the lives of American hostages at stake, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was concerned military action would risk the lives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in captivity, aides said. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the author of a 1986 task force report on terrorism, knew well the danger posed by military action to innocent civilians. `` Our principles of justice will not permit random retaliation against groups or countries,'' the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> report said. The report also acknowledged that counter-terrorism operations are high-risk missions that `` can have a severe negative impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prestige if they fail.'' The administration got a breather in the hostage drama Tuesday when the kidnappers of American hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> announced a 48-hour extension in his threatened execution. Administration officials said it was not certain whether the original deadline provided to the news media was real or not, or whether the reported extension means anything. In any event, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> clearly did not want <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be portrayed as a helpless captive of terrorists, dominated by their every move and forced to respond to their actions. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has been conducting other work'' beyond the hostage matter. `` It has not preoccupied the government on a fulltime basis ... `` We do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere,'' he said. `` But we do want to portray one of concern and one in which the government shares the concern of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for the citizens held hostage.'' For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, as well as <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the hostage situation is one they have grappled with since midway in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` If you've been through this before,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` you know you've got to plan for the long term. You can never be sure of your information.'' He said officials experienced in such matters `` emphasize the importance that everyone acknowledges in taking the time to fully ascertain the facts, to give a thorough assessment of the situation, to coordinate and diplomatically contact our allies ...'' It is basically the same process the administration _ first <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ has been pursuing for years.

<HEAD>Senate and House Have Different Approaches to Random Drug Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have bills to impose random drug testing on transportation workers, but the measures still have most of the differences that kept them from being combined into a single law a year ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill Tuesday that would require random and other testing of workers with safety-related jobs on planes, trains, trucks and buses, while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday passed a measure affecting only railroads. Similar bills passed both chambers last session, but lawmakers failed to come up with a single law. Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., a sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, said the committee's bill was the `` best way to prevent the lethal consequences of transportation substance abuse. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction over all modes of transportation, while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that produced the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill only covers railroads. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approach, <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would give workers the incentive to seek rehabilitation before they are caught while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure would encourage workers to wait until they are caught. Both bills authorize employers to conduct drug tests before hiring, on reasonable suspicion and after certain accidents, as well as at random. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation would require airline crews, railroad crews and truck and bus drivers to submit to a variety of drug and alcohol tests. Rehabilitation programs would be set up by employers for workers who voluntarily seek help, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill offers no guarantee of rehabilitation or continued employment for a worker caught by the tests or involved in a drug-related accident. The House bill would require testing only for railroad workers, and would mandate employers to set up rehabilitation programs for workers caught under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> already has ordered a wide range of drug tests, including random tests for railroad crews, but they have been challenged in the courts. The tests do n't cover alcohol abuse. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure is passed, a conference committee would have to work out the differences in the two bills before a law could be sent to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops, Stocks Up Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell against the Japanese yen for the third consecutive day today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index rose marginally. The dollar closed at 136.20 yen, down 0.45 yen from Tuesday's 136.65-yen finish It opened at 135.58 yen and moved between 135.50 yen and 136.30 yen. The dollar now has declined 3.25 yen in three days. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> dealer <PERSON> Yoshitsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanada </PERSON> said market players in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were mainly making position adjustments today in the absence of market-affecting news. `` The market's basic sentiment has been toward a weaker dollar because of the falling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, but Japanese investors were trying to buy whenever the dollar fell,'' he said. `` When investors found out that the dollar would n't fall further today, some of them started to buy it back, which helped the currency end higher than its opening rate,'' <PERSON> Hanada </PERSON> added. But because of a slowdown in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, the dollar seemed unlikely to rise again, he said, adding: `` Friday's -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- jobless rate report will be another indicator.'' On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained in early trading but ended up only 0.88 points, or 0.003 percent, higher, closing at 34,899.334. It surpassed the 35,000 mark for the first time at the end of morning trading. But <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said investors started selling to take profits as soon as the afternoon session began, and the index fell back. `` Market players avoided buying to prevent prices from rising too fast,'' he added. Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 800 million shares, up from Tuesday's 700 million. Among gainers were steel, electric power company and chemical issues.

<HEAD>Bloch Said ``Pierre'' Was Just Stamp-Collecting Friend, Sources Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Suspected spy <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> says he knew his presumed <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> contact only as a stamp collector, according to informed sources who also say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat has n't confessed to taking money from the Soviets. The sources, commenting Tuesday only on condition of anonymity, said suspicions about <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> first arose when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intercepted a May 14 telephone call to <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> from a man named <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, believed to be a Soviet agent in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The suspected Soviet agent was among several individuals under surveillance, including one who works for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization, <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>, according to the sources. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> set up a meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities arranged for surveillance by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> intelligence service, said the sources. The French filmed <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> and the suspected <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent exchanging briefcases a few days later at a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> restaurant, the sources said. Another telephone call from <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> came June 22, after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official had returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> voiced veiled concerns that the two of them might be under counterintelligence surveillance, the sources said. Three sources essentially confirmed details of events first reported Tuesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. No charges have been filed against <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. The telephone call tipping <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> that he might be in danger was said to have come on the same day the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called him in, stripped him of his building pass and diplomatic passport, and placed him on administrative leave. Soon afterward, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> held its only interview with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. In it, he portrayed <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> as a stamp collector and used that relationship to explain the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting, the sources said. During that interview, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> made no admission that he was working for the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> or that he had accepted money from the Soviets, according to the sources. Other reports have suggested he has told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> he accepted money. Meanwhile, the apparent standoff in <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s espionage case continued Tuesday, with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> inside his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apartment, which coincidentally is just one block from the Soviet consulate. The apartment was under constant watch by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the news media. Intelligence sources said the job of making an espionage case against him remains difficult because of the lack of a confession. They said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials may at some point be forced to abandon any plans to prosecute and instead may make a deal with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> to do a damage assessment _ an inventory of information that has been lost or compromised _ if they remain convinced he actually was helping the Soviets.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> never does anything halfway. If you need proof, the evidence is on display at <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> Theater where he has opened in a dazzling one-man show called `` <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> in Concert: Dress Casual. There's nothing casual about <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> except maybe his clothes _ red T-shirt, gray sneakers and baggy, black pants. The intense performer, best known to theater audiences as <PERSON> Che </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> in `` Evita'' and <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON> in `` Sunday in the Park with <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' is one of those unique artists who can make an audience cheer. At the <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, he scorches the stage with a virtuosic performance that is as exhausting as it is exhilarating. What makes his show so special? <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> does n't just stand there and sing. He takes over each song as if it were a story, and he were telling it directly to you. There's a simplicity in his communication that is disarming, particularly when he is sweetly singing an old standard like `` Pennies from Heaven'' or <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>.'' But he's not afraid of a little histrionics either, like his almost over-the-edge, down-on-one-knee version of <PERSON> Jolson </PERSON>'s `` My Mammy'' or `` On the <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>'' performed at full throttle. Although there is a heavy dose of theater songs, <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON>'s wide-ranging repertoire is astonishing His precise diction and exact phrasing make him a natural singer of <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> songs. And he does n't disappoint, coming up with two numbers from `` Into the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' as well as a heartfelt rendition of the title song from `` Anyone Can Whistle'' and a hilarious version of `` Buddy's Blues'' from `` Follies. His grouping of songs is equally effective. Not many performers would open with `` <PERSON> Doodle </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo </PERSON>,'' move right into `` When the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bob-Bob-Bobbin </ORGANIZATION>' Along'' and then finish with `` Tchaikowsky,'' a tongue-twisting recitation of Russian composers from `` Lady in the Dark'' that <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> made famous. Somehow it works. The show also includes a medley of seven songs from `` Pal <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>'' that seems like a mini-version of the <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> musical, as well as an impassioned `` Soliloquy'' from `` Carousel.'' Both shows sound like ideal vehicles for the singer if he decides to return to the musical theater. In the `` Carousel'' number, <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> bounds around the stage and even does a few chin ups on a backstage bar while he sings. There are several comic highlights including a wacky version of the <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> standard `` A-Tisket A-Tasket'' that sounds like it came out of the television police show `` Dragnet'' and a rare <PERSON> Kander </PERSON> and Ebb song, `` Coffee in a Cardboard Cup,'' done with all the sound effects of a typical greasy spoon restaurant. There should be a special mention for piano wizard <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON>'s partner during the evening. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is not just an accompanist. He anticipates the singer's needs and provides the support that <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> needs as he does his dangerous high-wire balancing act. One final note. No microphones are used during the show. It's a relevation and a relief to hear <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON>'s unique voice without the tinny interference of modern technology. `` <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> in Concert'' truly is `` live'' theater at its best. In other reviews: <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON>'s show the `` most exciting ... in ages.'' `` The range of what he does and the imagination and power with which he does it are enough for you to imagine he could singlehandedly revive the American musical theater,'' <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Patinkin </PERSON> the greatest entertainer on Broadway today and described the concert as `` dazzling fun.'' While he can bring tears to your eyes, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said, `` most of the time you are just happy to be in the same room with him.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> described the show as `` audacious, often brilliant, but also a touch wacky.'' `` Instead of a bland, all-American confidence, he radiates a fierce, neurotic intelligence,'' <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said.

 Well-dressed passersby did n't hesitate to walk off with computers, desks and other items as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals emptied the office of a downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> computer company whose owner recently was shot to death. `` This is downtown, the Wall Street of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and people are grabbing and acting like it's a farmer's market and they do n't have to pay,'' said <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, a lobbyist who stopped to watch the eviction on Tuesday Some people were on their way to work and others were heading to a sale at a nearby office supply store when they spotted the merchandise at curbside. Dressed in dark suits, ties, dresses and high heels, the treasure hunters tossed about words like `` megabytes'' and `` modems'' as they rummaged. Marshals removed all the furniture and supplies from an office that had been leased by <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, who was fatally shot on June 28 by a man who walked into another business he owned. No arrests have been made in connection with the slaying. The company was evicted because it owed over $ 150,000 in rent, said <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Esherick </PERSON>, comptroller for Hunter Leasing. District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police said the scavengers are liable for prosecution on a misdemeanor or felony theft charge, depending on whether what they took was worth $ 250 or more. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal's office said the property belongs to the owners and is not considered abandoned until it has been on the curb for 72 hours.

 <LOCATION> WARSAW </LOCATION>: increasingly independent. Prior to <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s election, the Communists lost a key parliament vote for the first time in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as Solidarity pushed through a resolution to investigate the outgoing government for economic misconduct. The free trade union movement believes the government of <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> _ now <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief _ should be held accountable for the unraveling of the economy during its nine months in office. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, convulsed by consumer shortages and triple-digit inflation, suffered further Tuesday when price controls were lifted on meat, sugar and other basic commodities. After a Sejm speech by Communist floor leader <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON>, in which he charged such an investigation would not be fair, the deputies voted 206-169 with 31 abstentions to create the commission anyway. The commission would decide if there were legal grounds to refer government misconduct to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, which handles prosecutions of the government. It was the first substantive vote the Communists have lost, although they have been on the losing side of some procedural matters.

 After bracing for the worst, relatives of hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said they hoped his two-day reprieve would lead to his release after three years in captivity. `` For the next two days, we want to see what kind of movements take place,'' said his brother, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. `` This is an opportunity for everyone to pull together, right now. We really need this.'' Shiite Moslem extremists who have been holding <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> threatened to kill him at 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a religious leader. More than two hours after the deadline, they announced a 48-hour extension. `` I am mentally and physically worn out and now we must endure this for another two days. We are being held hostage, just like my father,'' said one of <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s sons, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 27, an electronics technician from nearby <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 58, was acting comptroller at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was kidnapped from the campus Sept. 12, 1986. The threat to kill <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> came shortly after another group said Monday it had hanged hostage Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in retaliation for <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 66, came out from his suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> house several times Tuesday to answer questions from reporters. He called the extension `` good news for all of us.'' <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, the sister of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest-held Western hostage, agreed that the extension could improve the situation. `` I think the longer they talk, the longer they delay, the greater the chances that we may turn this around and get them all home,'' said Ms. Say in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, was the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> when he was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985 Former hostage <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> action that apparently led to the reported hanging of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> may have spoiled plans for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s release. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, speaking from his <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> home, said sources in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> told him that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was to be freed last Saturday by the new Iranian government as a gesture of good will. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> said she fears commenting on recent developments while her husband, <PERSON> Alann </PERSON>, remains a hostage. He was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Jan. 24, 1987. `` It's not my place to say anything right now,'' she said Monday afternoon outside her parents' <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> home. `` We worry about all of the hostages constantly, 24 hours a day.'' <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> are three of the eight Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Before hearing of <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s extension, his brother stuck to his belief that diplomacy was the only way to free his brother. `` I do n't want to see any military action to try to rescue the hostages. That would seal their fate,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said. But two of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s sons said force should n't be ruled out. `` It's time we took some kind of action. Who knows what kind of threats are going to be made in the next 48 hours? I have President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in my prayers and I pray that he makes the right choice,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said. Asked about the prospects of military action, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said, `` I think it's probably going to come to that. Negotiations are best, but that's a last resort. If it comes to that, at least we can say we tried,'' he said. After his 20-year marriage broke up, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> worked in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before accepting the post in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1984. He remained close to his family in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the Cicippios believed he was protected from kidnapping because he converted to Islam and married a Lebanese woman.

<HEAD>U.S. Air Force Removes Cruise Missiles from Greenham Common</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENHAM COMMON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first cruise missiles have been removed from <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Common </LOCATION> but the women who made the base a synonym for protest say they are n't going anywhere. `` Just because the Americans are moving out a measly 16 missiles everyone expects us to go away,'' <PERSON> Catrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Howse </PERSON>, who had been involved in the protests for seven years, said Tuesday. `` We are here to stay. This is nothing more than a military manipulation exercise. We've nothing to celebrate until the entire base is shut and restored as common land.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transport plane flew out the first group of the 96 missiles at <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Common </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, said 16 missiles were removed Tuesday but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> refused to disclose a number. The missiles are to be destroyed at <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. All the missiles are to be removed by 1991 under the U.S.-Soviet intermediate weapons arms control treaty signed in 1987. Anti-nuclear campaigners established a peace camp outside the base in 1981, but the protests gained prominence after the deployment of the cruise missiles on Nov. 14, 1983. At the height of the protests, 35,000 women encircled the base. On Tuesday, about a hundred women appeared around the base, and a few climbed over the barbed-wire atop the base's fences before being rounded up by military police. `` <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> will remain a focus of non-violence. We are not impressed with this publicity gimmick. As long as military weapons are in this country we will be here,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Junor </PERSON>. `` It is a victory for the women at the camp who have stayed here year in and year out and kept the issue in the public light,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who brought a bottle of champagne. `` It is n't the end but it's a great day.'' One woman, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, had come to the base hoping to say goodbye to more than the missiles. `` I'll be glad to see the back of them and those bloody women,'' she said. `` I support what they are doing but they have made such a mess of the area they will not be missed.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main opposition group claimed today that President-elect <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> secretly sent his brother to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to `` closely supervise'' the killing of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has been quoted by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> as denying in a meeting with visiting Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had any `` relation to the tragedy.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, or People's Holy Warriors, said in a statement that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> exerts direct control of the radical Shiite Moslem groups believed to be holding Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The group said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> sent his brother, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, `` secretly to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> a few days ago in order to closely supervise the terrorist acts of the regime's proxies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including the execution of the American hostage, Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.'' The opposition's statement said <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> heads the Iranian foreign ministry's `` <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'' set up to coordinate the kidnappers' activities. The statement was sent by telex to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where the group has its headquarters. A Shiite Moslem group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> claimed it hanged the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> on Monday in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction Friday of a Shiite Moslem cleric in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The group released a videotape that purported to show <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> hanging from a makeshift gallows. There was no indication when it was filmed. Prior reports indicated that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who led a 75-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce monitoring force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, may have been killed by his captors last year. Moslem fundamentalist groups loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are believed to be holding most of the 16 western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are thought to be linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group seeking to dominate the 1.2-million strong Shiite community in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the country's largest sect The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> statement alleged that several <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> officials sent from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were told to `` extend their stay in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for another two weeks on the orders of President-elect <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> in order to carry out the execution of <LOCATION> Col </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> denies it has anything to do with hostage-taking, while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has sought to distance itself from the reported hanging and threats to execute other western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who was voted president by a landslide majority in Friday's election, is believed anxious to erase <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s image as a sponsor of international terrorism. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said Monday before <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' death was announced the threat against him `` has nothing to do with us However, we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat.'' But on Sunday, Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> warned that Islamic groups around the world would retaliate for the aduction of the cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> statement said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used its embassy in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, as a headquarters for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> activities in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is a close ally of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The statement said Iranian Revolutionary Guards based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were responsible for `` military training of terrorists, operational planning, interrogations and other intelligence operations by the regime's proxy terrorist groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' About 4,000 Revolutionary Guards are currently believed based in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 1979 fundamentalist revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> helped spawn several Shiite terrorist groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Revolutionary Guards, sent into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during the 1982 Israeli invasion, helped organize <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Researchers Use Liquid To Help Premature Baby Breathe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new respiration technique that uses a liquid to deliver oxygen to a patient's lungs could save premature babies and affect the abortion debate, researchers said. In May, a baby born after 28 weeks of gestation and within an hour or two of death from lung damage was kept alive 19 hours when doctors filled the infant's lungs with perfluorocarbon, an oxygen-carrying liquid, said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> physiologist and pediatrician who led the team. He and his colleagues are on call to attempt the procedure again when a candidate becomes available, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. The baby girl, born two months premature and weighing just under 2 pounds, was the first human to undergo the procedure, according to Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a pediatric surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisico </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was not involved in the research in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. If the procedure could be shown to shorten the time a fetus is dependent on its mother, the technology could affect the abortion debate in the country, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. In its controversial decision July 3, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled states may require doctors to determine through various tests whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving outside the womb. Many states prohibit aborting a viable fetus, but the court's 1973 decision making abortion legal drew the viability line at 24 weeks. Generally, premature babies delivered 23 to 24 weeks from conception stand a chance of surviving without major disabilities, researchers said. If the liquid ventilation technique is successful, it could push that time period back to 20 weeks, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. However, it is still unclear whether organs other than the lungs would be developed enough to sustain life at 20 weeks, he said. Aside from premature babies, the procedure holds promise for any kind of situation where a patient's lungs can not be ventilated with gas, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a chemist at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> who first discovered the technique, said perfluorocarbon acts as a liquid Teflon to gently separate parts of the lung that stick together after a collapse in a premature baby. In adults, the body produces surfactant, which prevents the inside of a lung from sticking to itself. But in premature babies who have not yet developed surfactant or in babies who lack the material, normal ventilation runs the risk of bursting a lung or damaging it, he said. The infant, whose lungs had been damaged by two weeks of conventional ventilation and had partially collapsed, was close to death May 10 when the experiment was performed, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. About a half ounce of perfluorocarbon, a liquid that carries oxygen, was poured into the baby's lungs through her trachea, he said. About another quarter ounce of the liquid was allowed to flow in and out of her lungs, bringing fresh oxygen, for 15 minutes, <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Nissan to Ban Chloroflourocarbons from Its Vehicles by 1993</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today that it plans to make its car air conditioners and manufacturing processes free of chlorofluorocarbons, the gases blamed for destroying the Earth's protective ozone layer, by 1993 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> became the first of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s major automakers _ which are heavy users of chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB- _ to announce a total ban on the gases. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Shingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said the company, helped by air-conditioning makers such as <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Calsonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is developing new car air conditioners that use a new substance to replace CFC-12. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> has used some 1,150 tons of CFC-12 a year as coolants, he said, and a total of 1,500 tons of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s a year for all purposes, accounting for 1.2 percent of total <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the spokesman said, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> already has stopped using CFC-11 in the making of automobile bumpers and will do so in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by the end of next year. By the end of 1993, he said, the company plans to replace CFC-113 with water for cleansing automobile parts. He said this will require the company to develop additional processes to dry parts after washing. CFC-113 dries instantly. `` But it depends on the feasibility of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> alternatives,'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said. `` If we can get stable supplies of new substitutes, our goal is certainly attainable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said, `` Although we've been considering environmental issues, we have n't reached the stage to announce anything concrete.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s move would `` prompt <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> to consider the issue more seriously and swiftly.'' An official of the freon countermeasure division in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> called such moves by the private sector `` very welcome.'' Companies that have to use additional machines and substances in the process of cutting <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use can obtain tax reductions, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 38 countries agreed in 1987 to reduce production and use of the gases. Under the Montreal Protocol, participating countries must freeze their CFC consumption this year at the 1986 level and reduce consumption to 5 percent of the 1986 level by the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Legislation Proposed to Shield Public Figures From Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lawmaker is proposing a bill that would allow drivers to prevent anyone from finding their home addresses through state motor vehicle records, the way a man apparently tracked slain actress <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>. `` We intend to prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening again,'' Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Pro-tem </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>, 19, has been charged with shooting Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> to death on July 18 outside her apartment complex. He allegedly hired an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> detective agency to locate <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>. She was traced through Department of Motor Vehicles records. Currently, the motor vehicle department will provide the address of any license holder to anyone who fills out a request form and pays a small fee. The form does ask the reason for the request. Under a proposal <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> plans to introduce later this month, a person applying for a driver's license or to register a vehicle would be allowed to request their home address be kept confidential, he said. Applicants would have to provide a post office box or alternative address, or the address of an attorney or agent that could be given to anyone who files an address request, he said. The bill `` will provide a balance between the public's right to know and the right to privacy,'' <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said at a news conference outside a DMV office in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. About 16 million requests were filed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last year, <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said. Anyone can obtain the home address `` of their favorite anchor person, favorite movie star, favorite Los Angeles Dodger or favorite politician, if they have one,'' he said. City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said numerous crime victims and trial witnesses have been harassed by people who located them through motor vehicle records. `` Right now we're all sitting ducks,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. `` Home is the last refuge of your privacy, and if someone is intent on doing malicious harm they're going to see it through.'' The proposal follows last week's signing by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of a law inspired by alleged threats against actress <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorquodale </PERSON> said the law he sponsored was designed to keep violent, mentally ill prisoners in mental hospitals after they complete their sentences. To do so, a district attorney must prove an inmate will be a danger to someone following release. Miss <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON> was stabbed several years ago by drifter <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> allegedly wrote letters from prison threatening to harm the actress when he was paroled. A parole board postponed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s scheduled June 15 parole for nine months, saying he had fought with the prison staff and broken a window.

<HEAD>New Front-Runner in Japan's Prime Ministerial Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former education minister who served a reform-minded government in the 1970s today emerged as front-runner in the race to become <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next prime minister, governing party members said. <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> became the leading choice to replace <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who has been in power only two months, after 78-year-old <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Komoto </PERSON> said he would not run for president of the deeply troubled <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. That cleared the way for <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Komoto </PERSON>'s protege, whose candidacy drew support from other factions in the conservative governing party. `` I'm overwhelmed by the honor and will do my best,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said at a news conference after <PERSON> Komoto </PERSON>'s faction, with 30 members one of the smallest in the party, united behind him. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, who earlier had said he supported <PERSON> Komoto </PERSON> for party leader, was the only declared candidate for the post. The Liberal Democrats' president is certain to be elected prime minister because of the long-governing party's commanding majority in the lower house of parliament. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said it was too early to speak in detail about his policies, `` but political reform is the biggest issue that has been raised by the people.'' He said he had received about $ 110,000 in political funds over five years from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate at the center of the influence-buying scandal that originally rocked the political establishment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said all the donations had been reported, and that he had stopped receiving money from the company after the scandal emerged last year. The Liberal Democrats are to choose a new leader on Tuesday. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> is resigning to take responsibility for the setback in the July 23 election in which the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost their majority in parliament's upper house for the first time in the party's 34 years, with opposition Socialists gaining strongly. <PERSON> Komoto </PERSON>, whose faction ranks a lowly fifth in size among the party's power blocs, told reporters he had decided not to be a candidate after canvassing opinion in the party, where many members say they want a younger president to help repair the party's image. `` I've decided that having <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> run is the most appropriate and the best,'' the party elder said. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, a 10-term member of the lower house, was a follower of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miki </PERSON>, who led the government from 1974 to 1976 following <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>'s scandal-plagued administration. <PERSON> Miki </PERSON> was known as the `` Mr. Clean'' of Japanese politics for efforts he made to throttle back corruption, and <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> served as deputy chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary under <PERSON> Miki </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> served twice as education minister, totaling about two years. He is a member of the party reform committee that was set up in the wake of the Recruit scandal. The Liberal Democrats, in power for more than three decades, have lost popularity amid a series of scandals that accentuated the party's image as arrogant and complacent. The party also railroaded through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a new 3 percent sales tax that is extremely unpopular. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> stepped down June 2 because of the party's low popularity and was succeeded by Uno, whose scandal-free image quickly crumbled amid allegations he had kept paid mistresses.

<HEAD>Military Personnel Overseas Will be Counted in 1990 Census</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 3rd and 4th grafs to CORRECT that states fear loss of representation
and to clarify use of census figures in distributing House seats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> blocked an effort Tuesday to require aliens to be excluded from the census numbers used in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reapportionment every decade. But the question still may be raised in committee and in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The national head count will be taken April 1, 1990. Census figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments. The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats. Most of these states are in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, where growth has lagged behind that of the South and West. Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West and industrial states like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted. While aliens have been counted in the past, military personnel stationed overseas have not. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> settled that problem by announcing it will work with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on ways to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers who live overseas. The problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents. That has yet to be decided, but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months. The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both in committee and on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $ 5.8 million to run the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Commerce departments next year, including $ 800 million to take the census The bill was approved 258-165 and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Opponents noted the Constitution requires <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats to be apportioned based on all the `` persons'' residing in a state. `` Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,'' observed Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in the census, responded Ridge The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4 billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens, he said. Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., charged the debate is really over population shifts that will lead to more House seats for southern and western states `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, I do n't care what they do, unless they go down to the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and bring the people back, they're going to lose a seat,'' said <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, said, however, that counting illegal aliens `` is not fair. It may be constitutional, but it's just not right.'' Census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete illegal aliens, contending they can not determine who is in the country legally. Asking people about their status likely would result in people lying or refusing to participate in the count, officials say, resulting in a potential undercount of residents in many areas.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> today defended <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kidnapping of a Lebanese Shiite clergyman, saying the Cabinet considered the dangers to foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before approving the abduction. Speaking to parliament, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also disclosed that the Cabinet had approved Friday's capture of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> two months ago. He said final approval was delayed until `` every grain of possibility for dialogue'' had been exhausted on winning the release of three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not inform any other country of its intentions to abduct <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. `` We did n't include any other country before the action and did not even offer information about it,'' he said. The 12-member inner Cabinet of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also met today to discuss the hostage crisis, but there was no word on the outcome of that meeting. In his address to parliament, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has rejected an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appeal to visit <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, who was abducted along with two associates from the south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Jibchit </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would agree only if the Red Cross was able to visit Israeli captives. During his 22-minute address, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> read anew <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s offer to swap Lebanese Shiite prisoners held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and for 16 Western hostages and the three Israelis. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is believed to be holding up to 60 Shiites in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and allied militias in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed to hold an additional 300. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> defended the <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> kidnap against criticism that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not consider the dangers to foreign hostages. `` We took into consideration all the possible reactions,'' he said. `` We saw them all, including the actions that already took place, and ones even worse.'' A Shiite group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> claimed it killed Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on Monday after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. A second group said another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, would be killed on Thursday unless the cleric is freed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was killed several months ago. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the Cabinet approved the abduction of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> movement that is believed an umbrella group for hostage-takers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, after extensive efforts to gain freedom for its captured soldiers. He did not detail those efforts. `` So the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> decided to allow the army to apprehend the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> so we would have in our hands valuable property for a prisoner swap,'' he said. He described the abduction of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, whom he accused of involvement in <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> kidnap and the abduction of two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, as `` very successful.'' `` On this stage, I want to send my blessings to the chief of staff and the commanders of the army and the unit that carried it out on the way this mission was carried out,'' he said. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> spoke in response to three motions of no confidence introduced by three small Arab-oriented parties. The motions in the 120-seat body were defeated by a 31-5 vote with one abstention and most of members absent. Mainstream opposition groups refused to join in the attack on the government, saying lives were at stake and criticism should be postponed. The defense minister was interrupted at one point by an Arab member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Miari </PERSON>, who chided <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> for announcing his hostage swap offer 30 minutes after the deadline set for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' purported hanging. Communist and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> legislators accused the government of kidnapping <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> to divert attention from efforts to resolve the Palestinian problem and end the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> IDAHO </LOCATION>: Hundreds of lightning-caused fires have burned 80,000 acres, much of that on national forest land. Flames were near three small mountain towns, and more than 5,000 firefighters were on the fire lines. MONTANA: A fire burning in grassland and scattered timber in the <ORGANIZATION> Custer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> became the state's biggest blaze of the summer Tuesday when it surpassed 1,200 acres. About 140 firefighters were dispatched to fight the blaze in the southeast corner of the state. Several smaller blazes burned elsewhere. <LOCATION> OREGON </LOCATION>: Fires east of the <LOCATION> Cascades </LOCATION> have burned 80,000 acres and were being fought Tuesday by 5,000 people. The worst of the blazes were around <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, where ranchers forced from their remote homes over the weekend were allowed back by Tuesday. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION>: Crews contained an 850-acre forest fire in the Pasayten Wilderness near the Canadian border Tuesday, freeing 80 firefighters to join battles in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

 Helicopters are rescuing people from rooftops in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where the worst flooding in more than 35 years has killed 15 people, destroyed thousands of houses and washed out crops, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The official news agency said sections of the main railroad in the region, the Vladivostok-Khabarovsky Railway, were destroyed Tuesday night. Bridges and tracks were ruined as the <LOCATION> Ussuri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malinovka </LOCATION> rivers overflowed near the city of <LOCATION> Dalnerechensk </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said 1,000 passengers were stranded at the <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> Railroad Station and that three passenger trains were turned into mobile homes for people waiting until the tracks are restored. In a report Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said rivers in the <LOCATION> Dalnerechensk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lesozavodsk </LOCATION> districts had risen more than 20 feet and caused a `` critical situation.'' Crops _ including potatoes, tomatoes and cucumbers _ were destroyed on more than 100 farms, and more than 70,000 head of cattle were cut off from pastures or stalls, the news agency said Tuesday. Thousands of houses were destroyed and hundreds of miles of roads and telephone and power lines were ruined. The <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that preliminary estimates put the number of dead in the floods at 15. The area is near the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 4,500 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and 250 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Rain inundated the area for five days, but it has now stopped and the water level of rivers is declining slowly, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Military helicopters were taking people perched on rooftops and trees to safety and bringing food, medicine and clothing to inundated villages. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the flooding was the worst in the area since 1953, when virtually the entire north of the maritime territory of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was under water.

<HEAD>New Polish Prime Minister Oversaw Talks with Solidarity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The country's new prime minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, played a leading role in suppressing Solidarity in 1981, but he also helped initiate this year's campaign that made the union legal again. Once a shadowy figure best known for his crackdowns on dissidents, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> emerged earlier this year as a valuable negotiating partner for the opposition in the two months of talks that resulted in Solidarity's legalization and in partially free elections. Despite <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s new outlook, Solidarity opposed him for prime minister. Members of the Communist-allied <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also talked of defecting, but he gained victory by a slim margin today in parliament. The 63-year-old army general, who has been interior minister since 1981 and thus supervised the nation's police forces, donned a civilian suit for this year's talks with Solidarity. He often drove his red <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> to a palace in downtown <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> where negotiations were held. With a mixture of charm and toughness, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> quickly impressed union negotiators. He disarmed underground writers by praising their essays. It was <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> who made the proposal for talks with the opposition on political and economic reform a year ago during a wave of nationwide strikes, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest since the early days of Solidarity seven years ago. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused to commit Solidarity to talks without a pledge that the union would be legalized. In a dramatic reversal, President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, then the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, pushed through an offer to restore the union's legal status at a party plenum in January. Three weeks later, as chief negotiator for the government side, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> opened the negotiations. Agreements reached April 5 led to legalization of Solidarity and partially free elections in which Solidarity scored dazzling victories July 4 and July 18. But <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> was one of 33 out of 35 top government and party officials who ran unopposed on a national slate and failed to get the required 50 percent of votes cast. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s relations with the opposition were not always so cordial. Along with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Florian </PERSON> <PERSON> Siwicki </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> helped impose the December 1981 martial-law crackdown in which thousands of Solidarity activists were rounded up and imprisoned. Three years later, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> security police on his payroll murdered the Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, a pro-Solidarity priest who kept the ethos of the union alive in monthly Masses for the homeland at his <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> parish. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> saw that the four officers were convicted of murder, but the trial stopped short of revealing any higher-level involvement, which some opposition members still suspect. As head of the ministry responsible for containing the opposition which flourished underground after martial law, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> developed a deep knowledge of Solidarity. One leading Solidarity activist who has spent years in jail recently joked that one of the best collections of underground literature can be found in the ministry's basement. Born in 1925, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s war experiences contributed to the evolution of a tough, young officer. Shipped by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to work as a forced laborer in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> escaped and made his way to communist resistance forces in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 and helped in the campaign against Polish partisans opposed to the imposition of Communist rule. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> later attended the <ORGANIZATION> Voroshilov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> of the Soviet armed forces in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and was promoted to general in 1973. He served as head of military intelligence between 1972 and 1979 and head of the military police in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> between 1979 and 1981. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> named <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> head of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in August 1981, several months before the crackdown on Solidarity.

<TEXT>
 Here is a text of the acceptance speech by Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> after his election as prime minister. The speech was monitored on Polish television and translated by The Associated Press: I would like to thank you for entrusting me with the honorable mission of forming the government of the Polish People's Republic. The confidence which I enjoyed in the support for my candidacy I treat as ... an obligation. I will do whatever is in my might not to fail this confidence. With attention, I approach those deputies who voted against my candidacy. Their opinion inclines me toward an active search for ways and means of gaining a broader parliamentary and social understanding and approval for the activities of the government which I intend to form. I face, and naturally the high chamber -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- faces, the question of the shape of the new Cabinet, its program and philosophy of functioning. I state with regret that so far, the concept of creating a `` grand coalition'' government has not been accepted. I think that a government of such a construction would be most appropriate today for overseeing the course of issues of the country. That is why in forming the Cabinet on as broad a basis as possible, I will not give up efforts to attract to it representatives of opposition circles with a hope that in the future a grand coalition government will be possible. I opt for a government of the `` roundtable.'' I do not refer here only to the symbol of agreement and national reconciliation, but most of all to its substantial content and ways of shaping the process of dialogue. A vision of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s development has been outlined in the roundtable accords -LRB- reached between Solidarity and Communist authorities in April -RRB-, corresponding with social aspirations and expectations The new government should work with all its effort toward realizing this vision, especially as far as the shape of the new economic order and political reforms are concerned. As co-chairman of the roundtable, I feel morally and politically obliged to guarantee the concluded agreement of Poles. I will thus do everything so that the directions of the government's work might correspond with the supreme reasons of state and the nation. The seriousness of the internal situation, especially in the economic sphere, imposes the necessity of quick action. I would thus like to ask the high chamber if I could present the program of action and makeup of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> within the next two weeks. Thank you.

<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts of a speech by <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, leader of the Solidarity opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, explaining why its members opposed the election of <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> as prime minister. The text was monitored on Polish television and translated by The Associated Press: The -LRB- Solidarity -RRB- Citizens' Parliamentary Club will vote against <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s candidacy for the post of chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>. We stand against this candidacy not because he is the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, of which this part of the chamber so often used to be the clientele. We also know in recent months that Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> can be a negotiator and can carry on dialogue with people on the other side of ideological and political barriers. We also appreciate the words uttered in his statement, referring to the continuation of the philosophy of the `` round table'' and the anticipation of changes. We stand against this candidacy because no personnel reshuffle within the present political arrangements, dictated by the monopoly of a single party, can solve the country's problems. We are of the opinion that one can not change things by continuing the present situation of the country, that a break is necessary, a break that will clearly say that we -LRB- Solidarity lawmakers -RRB- have arrived in this building on <LOCATION> Wiejska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. And I would like to be able to say that all of us have come in order to change things. ... I think that as we sit here, a will for change can be found on all sides of this chamber. However, in our opinion, changes in the way of exercising power must be made so that this change could correspond with the Polish situation. A political monopoly of exercising power by one party must be discarded and destroyed. It does not serve the country. And this is why we think that, with the necessary amount of confidence, the Polish opposition is capable of building a program of change and of carrying out this program. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement said clearly that the Polish opposition, all its circles, expects deep, structural changes and that the Polish opposition is ready to form a government appropriate to the tasks the country faces. It is ready to take responsibility not only for leading the country out of crisis but also for changing the way of exercising power. Because without this change the situation of the country can not improve. In a responsible way and with a feeling of realism we are able to form a government of national salvation. ... Such a government of change could be a chance for the country.

 In a major policy reversal, Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> said today he has told his Vietnamese-backed government to welcome a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace mission to be sent under terms of an international accord. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 18 other nations meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> agreed earlier this week to send the investigation team to help prepare for a permanent peace settlement in war-ravaged <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` I have already given instructions to give all the assistance necessary to this technical mission,'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said in a meeting with reporters at his hotel near the Champs-Elysees. At the start of the monthlong international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> had opposed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> playing any role in monitoring a peace plan. The world body recognizes a coalition of three Cambodian guerrilla factions as the nation's legitimate representative _ not <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government. The Vietnamese invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978, ousting communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rulers and installing the current regime. Renewed civil war quickly broke out, and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are now the strongest guerrilla force. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said he changed his mind about the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission after receiving assurances from the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that the visit of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission would not imply future <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> involvement in peace efforts. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team will present its report to a conference committee charged with creating a mechanism for monitoring the pullout of Vietnamese troops. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> has said the Vietnamese forces in his country have already been reduced to 26,000. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will pull out the last of those troops, once estimated at more than 50,000, by Sept. 27. It was still unclear, however, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team would leave for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and whether the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would make the unprecedented gesture of allowing the mission to visit the refugee camps it controls. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed an estimated 1 million people with its harsh programs after it drove out a U.S.-backed government and took power in 1975. The group's role in a future government has been a sticking point at the conference. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> says the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> should be destroyed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> should take part in a transitional government.

 Even Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hometown seems to be turning against him as the state grapples with budget troubles. <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> _ steadfast backers of the Democrat from his days as a state representative in 1962 through his failed presidential campaign _ sued the governor today over a plan to cut state aid to cities and towns. The city is accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of using one formula to hand out state aid and another formula to cut it. The change means <ORGANIZATION> Brookline </ORGANIZATION> faces a cut of $ 1.9 million in state aid for schools, police and fire protection instead of the expected $ 1.1 million reduction. `` To get to the point of where we're actually suing the state or the governor over his actions is a very painful, emotional step for me to come to,'' said Selectman Chairman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer. `` But I think he was wrong and I do n't think his actions in changing the local aid formula are legally defensible.'' The state's budget troubles _ which many blame on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ led to a $ 210 million reduction in aid to cities and towns last month. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, an aide to the governor, defended the use of a different formula to favor poorer communities when cutting grants. But he added that the governor has yet to decide on whether the formula will even be used. Local aid is distributed by a complicated `` needs basis'' formula; the second formula would make cuts on a per capita basis instead.

 Parliament today elected the interior minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, as prime minister in a victory for the long-ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose power has been eroding. In his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> pledged to try to bring members of the Solidarity-led opposition into his new Cabinet. He asked Solidarity to reverse its position that it will not accept joint responsibility for governing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Although it has rejected joining a coalition government, Solidarity has not ruled out allowing members to serve in the Cabinet. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, the nation's top law enforcement officer, was elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s lower house, the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, by a vote of 237 to 173 with 10 abstentions. The required majority was 211 votes. As interior minister, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> implemented the 1981 martial law crackdown that suppressed the free trade union movement, but he also helped initiate this year's campaign that made Solidarity legal again. The vote for prime minister had been postponed Tuesday when some deputies in the communist-allied <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sought a government dominated by lawmakers of the Solidarity independent trade union. But after urgent arm-twisting Tuesday night by their party leadership and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> officials, most <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members ended up voting for <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, the handpicked candidate of Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. `` Looks like they were frightened,'' said Solidarity member <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON> following the vote. Solidarity's floor leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, said in a speech before the vote that his group opposed <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s candidacy `` because no personnel reshuffle within the present political arrangements, dictated by the monopoly of a single party, can solve the country's problems. In reaching out to the opposition in his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said that `` in forming the Cabinet on as broad a basis as possible, I will not give up efforts to attract to it representatives of opposition circles with a hope that in the future a grand coalition government will be possible.'' `` I opt for a government of the roundtable,'' he said in a reference to the government-opposition talks that led to Solidarity's legalization this year. In his speech carried on Polish television, the new prime minister also promised `` quick action'' to deal with the country's economic problems After his election, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> asked for two weeks to assemble a Cabinet, which also must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>. He said he wanted Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON>, who handled economic policy under the outgoing government, to perform the same function in his Cabinet. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bielecki </PERSON>, a Solidarity deputy from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s government could be one that `` promotes a free market but retains a strong police. The election completes a two-week reshuffle of the top Polish leadership. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, for eight years the communist first secretary, assumed <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new strong presidency with control of the military and foreign relations July 19. Outgoing Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> succeeded him at the helm of the party Saturday. And now <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> loyalist with his own base in the army and defense ministries, has become head of government. Before <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> was elected, the Communists lost a key parliamentary vote for the first time in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as Solidarity pushed through a resolution to investigate the outgoing government for economic misconduct. Solidarity believes the outgoing government of <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> should be held accountable for the unraveling of the economy during its nine months. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, convulsed by consumer shortages and triple-digit inflation, suffered further Tuesday when price controls were lifted on meat, sugar and other basic commodities. Prices rose 43 percent for most goods. The Communist coalition holds a 299-161 majority in the Sejm, but the Communists have just 173 seats and they had not been sure they could count on deputies of the allied Peasant and Democratic parties, which used to obediently follow the Communists. According to several deputies, the Peasant caucus leader, <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentkowski </PERSON>, had proposed that they and Solidarity jointly form a government with a Solidarity prime minister. `` We have a general as president. Now they want a general as premier. And we know they want a Communist to be deputy premier,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member on condition of anonymity. `` What kind of new government is that supposed to be?'' Opposition lawmakers entered <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after June elections, the country's freest in four decades, ended the Communists' monopoly of legislative power The Solidarity victory was so overwhelming _ the movement won all but one of the seats it was allowed to contest _ that it asked to be allowed to form the new government, but <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> rejected the prospect as unacceptable to East bloc allies. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has promised to allow an eventual transition to complete democracy. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> represented the government in talks with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> that led to Solidarity's legalization in April after a seven-year ban. Like many leading Communists, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> failed to be elected a deputy in the June elections though he ran without opposition. He needed 50 percent of the vote to win a seat.

 A strong earthquake crumbled homes and triggered landslides in the remote province of <ORGANIZATION> Irian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaya </ORGANIZATION>, killing at least 90 people and injuring more than 125, officials said today. Rescue efforts were hampered by the landslides and by cracks in the airstrip nearest the stricken area. The quake struck Tuesday and measured 6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. In the villages of <LOCATION> Holuon </LOCATION>, Soba and <LOCATION> Pasema </LOCATION>, 90 bodies were found under demolished homes and tons of mud, a spokesman from the governor's office in <ORGANIZATION> Irian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaya </ORGANIZATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. About 3,000 people live in the villages. The spokesman, <PERSON> Supardi </PERSON>, said more than 25 people had been treated for serious injuries and 100 for slight injuries, and about 300 had been evacuated to safer areas. He said more helicopters were needed to help evacuate victims. The quake destroyed a number of villages along the side of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kurima </LOCATION> in the district of <LOCATION> Kurima </LOCATION>, 2,190 miles east of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. The villages were near the epicenter of the quake, which struck at 9:17 a.m. Tuesday. <PERSON> Supardi </PERSON> said mud and earth piled 650 feet high were blocking the <LOCATION> Baliem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which flows around <LOCATION> Kurima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, making it difficult to reach victims and raising fears the river would burst through and flood nearby villages. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Breuker </PERSON>, a senior official from the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION>, said the missionary organization had two helicopters and a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> helping rescue efforts but that he could not get any details from the rescue teams because of bad communications. <ORGANIZATION> Irian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaya </ORGANIZATION> is one of the most primitive areas in the world. Natives of some of the 240 tribal groups still hunt with bows and arrows. The quake Tuesday was the worst in the province since 1981, when a quake killed more than 300 people. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 6 can cause severe damage.

 A businessman was the informant who led <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in 1964 to the graves of three slain civil rights workers in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, according to files of the state's old segregation agency The files naming <PERSON> Olen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON> were obtained by The Clarion-Ledger. Its account Tuesday represented the first time the tipster who purportedly led agents to the bodies in an earthen dam has been publicly identified. <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON> on Monday denied any connection with the killings of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and denied being an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant. `` I did n't have nothing to do with it,'' <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON> told the Clarion-Ledger. `` I'm not going to have anything to do with it now. The state never charged anyone with the murders, which have become the focus of renewed attention since being dramatized in the movie `` Mississippi Burning.'' Several men were convicted of civil rights violations in the case. The 1964 report to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Burrage </PERSON>, on whose land the bodies were found, was paid $ 30,000 by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to reveal the location of the graves. The report was prepared by commission investigator A.L. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who has since died, and quotes an anonymous informant. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in charge of the investigation, refused to identify the informant who <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files said led agents to the bodies. He added in an interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home, `` I did n't pay any money to anybody.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said a free-lance writer working on the case during the 44 days federal and state officials looked for the three civil rights workers had offered a reward of $ 25,000 for information leading to the bodies. The commission, created in 1956 to preserve segregation, became inactive in 1973 and was disbanded in 1977. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> ordered its files sealed for 50 years. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Thursday ordered the files opened to the public, but <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> stayed his own order pending an appeal. The newspaper said it obtained the report from the personal papers of the late Gov. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Documents that have leaked from the files over the years show the agency routinely kept files on civil rights activists and individuals friendly with them.

 The remnants of Hurricane Chantal carried heavy rains and tornadoes into central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today, while divers renewed the search for 10 crewmen missing since their oil rig capsized in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. At least three deaths were blamed on the storm. A man died after falling from a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> oil platform off of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and two <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> teen-agers drowned when they were sucked into a flood-swollen drainage ditch. Also today, Tropical Storm Dean developed into the second hurricane of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season, bearing 78 mph winds it surged westward toward the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The hurricane was 500 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, moving at 20 mph. <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> roared ashore Tuesday morning at <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on the eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, bringing driving rain and wind up to 80 mph. The first hurricane of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season caused flooding and scattered power outages but little serious damage. It lost strength within a few hours and was downgraded to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression by Tuesday night. Winds dropped to about 30 mph. By early today, the storm's remains were spread over about 90 miles from College Station to <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, triggering rain and tornadoes. No damage was immediately reported in central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Forecasters said the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area could get as much as 5 inches of rain in gusty thunderstorms today. Divers today resumed their searched for the oil workers 20 miles off <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Their self-propelled rig, which can be floated when its 100-foot legs are retracted, capsized Monday while trying to outrun <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON>. Rough seas hampered the divers, who were equipped with high-powered lights to search the darkened rig. There were conflicting reports about where the men were last seen _ in the water or in the watertight crew quarters now submerged in about 30 feet of water, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMont </PERSON>. `` They're not sure where they're likely to be, exactly. It's going to take awhile The divers are going to move real slow and real cautiously,'' he said. In <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, about 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, police said two teen-agers drowned while they and two friends were riding rubber rafts on a rain-swollen stream. The boys were swept into a drainage pipe under a highway bypass. Skies were sunny today in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area, where on Tuesday hundreds of stalled cars and trucks lined flooded roads and some motorists sat atop their vehicles as they waited for the water to recede. <PERSON> Nena </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, whose family lost nearly all of their possessions in a 1979 flood in <LOCATION> Dickinson </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, tied ribbons around the bases of trees to watch the progress of the rising water in her yard. `` We just got through celebrating 10 years since that flood. We had water up to here in that one,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said, using her hand to mark a spot more than 3 feet high. `` We made it through that and the Lord gave us so much more. And we have flood insurance this time _ that's the main thing.'' The coastal city of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> escaped much of <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON>'s wrath, but the 6.56 inches of rain in a 24-hour period there broke a 110-year-old record. Most of the homes in the area directly hit by <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> were built on stilts, limiting much of the damage to roof tiles, exterior walls and electric lines. `` It was n't too bad, but it sure shook that trailer,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Estis </PERSON>, who lives in a 27-foot travel trailer in <LOCATION> Gilchrist </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>. `` I was going to move it out this morning, but it came in too early so I just decided to wait it out.'' <PERSON> Estis </PERSON> then did what few others along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast would have considered in winds topping 50 mph on the leading edge of a hurricane. He went fishing. `` Oh, I just figured I'd come down here and give it a try. I caught one while the eye was passing over, but I have n't had a bite since then,'' he said.

 Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> has agreed to extradite a man wanted in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on murder charges after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities agreed not to try the man for any offense carrying the death penalty. A Home Office statement Tuesday said <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Soering </PERSON>, 22, a German national whose father is the West German consul in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, would face charges of non-capital murder. No date for the extradition was announced. Soering is accused of killing the wealthy parents of his girlfriend, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON>. Soering and Miss <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON> were indicted on murder charges after they had fled to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON>, now 24, did not resist extradition from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and was sentenced in October 1987 to 90 years in prison after admitting being an accessory to the murders. Soering resisted extradition and took his case to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, a branch of the 23-nation Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> belongs. The court found last month that extradition would contravene the Human Rights Convention if there was a risk Soering might be sentenced to death. The court said the convention would not be breached if the possibility of a death sentence was removed. The Home Office said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities agreed to drop the possibility of a death sentence to facilitate extradition. The prosecution claims Soering killed his girlfriend's parents, <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON>, 72, and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, 55, at their home in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in March 1985.

<TEXT>
 Syrian and Christian forces skirmished on the Moslem New Year today with mortars and automatic rifles, wounding six people, police said. `` There is no celebration mood. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been largely demolished and hundreds of innocent people have been killed. Do you expect anyone to celebrate anything?'' said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem clergyman at the Dar al-Fatwa center. Four of the casualties were in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and two were in the city's western Moslem sector, most of them from sniper fire, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. By police count, the 5-month-old confrontation between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> soldiers and Syrian forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has claimed 511 lives and wounded 2,168 people. Syrian troops moved into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to contain the civil war which broke out in April 1975. The Syrians eventually were drawn into the strife, supporting the Moslem side against the Christians. Ferocious artillery duels betwen <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners and the Syrian army inflicted severe damage on most of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> forcing 1.3 million of its original 1.5 million population to desert the city and seek refuge in safer areas. <PERSON> Dar </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Fatwa </PERSON>, the highest Sunni Moslem religious authority, called off its traditional New Year reception today because of the current round of violence. Government offices, banks, and other businesses closed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors to mark the Moslem New Year, 1410. The current confrontation broke out March 8, two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for depriving the ailing state treasury of about $ 100 million annually in lost customs dues. The Syrians and their Moslem militia allied forces retaliated by shelling and besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A three-member Arab League foreign ministers' mediation committee said Tuesday it has reached an `` impasse'' for which it blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was investigating allegations that famed Austrian conductor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> had been involved in Nazi persecutions, but the probe was dropped when he died last month, a government lawyer said today.

<TEXT>
 The crew of the nuclear submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, thwarted last week by anti-nuclear protestors, launched a Trident 2 missile today in the first successful underwater test of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest, deadliest weapon. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was cruising about 50 miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> when the 44-foot Trident 2 burst to the surface, ignited and propelled a dummy warhead package far down the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> tracking range. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced several minutes after the 11 a.m. firing that the test flight was a success. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> statement provided no details. The results were in sharp contrast to the Trident 2's first submarine launch on March 21 when the missile pinwheeled out of control and exploded four seconds after it was launched from the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Investigators traced the problem to a mechanical linkage responsible for moving the rocket nozzles back and forth. The system was redesigned. The test had been scheduled last Friday but was halted when two large <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> ships sailed into the launch danger zone in international waters. Two small motorized rafts dispatched from one of the ships buzzed the submarine and crew members attached three `` nuclear free seas'' banners to it. The Greenpeace vessels did not return today. Protest officials said last week they had made their point by stopping the launch and calling attention to their cause. The launch today was one of about eight underwater tests planned over the next few months. If all goes as planned, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will dispatch the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on patrol in March with 24 of the nuclear-tipped missiles. Each of the $ 23.7 million missiles is designed to hurl up to 10 nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to have the Trident 2 operational late this year, but that was delayed by the March explosion.

 `` The Killing Fields,'' the movie that showed the brutality of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule in the 1970s in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, will be shown in a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> theater Friday for the first time, the director said. Among those attending the screening will be <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Schanberg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist depicted in the 1984 Academy Award-winning film, who will make his first visit to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since he left there 14 years ago. Director <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> said today it is time to show the film there because diplomatic events have created optimism that peace will return to the country. `` It is important that Cambodians see this film so that they can actually feel that there is a chronicle of their own history,'' the British director told a news conference in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The showing of the film in the National Theater in <LOCATION> Pnomh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> capital, is being organized by Operation <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a U.S.-based relief agency. One of its co-founders, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>, said the premier of the Vietnamese-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, gave the go-ahead in March. The film depicts how <PERSON> Schanberg </PERSON>, then a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, and his <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> assistant, <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> <PERSON> Pran </PERSON>, were separated as the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> entered <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> in April 1975 and began its fanatical revolution. Hundreds of thousands died in torture chambers and slave labor camps, but <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> <PERSON> Pran </PERSON> made it out in a trek to the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border through fields littered with human bones. Vietnamese troops invaded in 1978 and installed a new government, which is fighting a three-party resistance that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schanberg </PERSON>, who now writes for <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, said there was a growing fear the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could return to power as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> carries out a pullout it has promised will be completed by late September. That, he said, `` is a pretty horrible and awesome thought.'' Peace talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> this month are aimed at setting up an interim government. <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> said the film has been available in videocassette in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> but this would be the first screening in a theater and with official sanction. A Cambodian film on the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule, `` Shadow of Darkness,'' also will be shown in the theater on Friday.

 A leading intellectual, suspected of acting as a key link between deposed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and that nation's crushed student movement, has escaped to the West, an activist said today. The intellectual, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yizi </PERSON>, fled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> several weeks ago on an `` underground railroad,'' the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> activist said. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, who is about 50, was director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restucturing </ORGANIZATION> the Economy, an influential think tank when <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was in power. While in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> participated in meetings to form an overseas organization to push for democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. However, he did not meet the press nor was his identity revealed to reporters. Indeed, some Western reports said he had been arrested in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> activist, who demanded anonymity, said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> remained in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but declined to reveal his current whereabouts. There was no way to immediately confirm the report, but the activist has been reliable in the past. So far, the activist said, about 30 people have fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> via the `` underground railroad'' set up to help pro-democracy leaders escape a government crackdown. They include essayist <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> and student leader <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, who were in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> but have since gone to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has said Communist authorities apparently wanted to establish direct ties between <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> to prove the purged party leader secretly backed the student movement. Chinese authorities began their crackdown on the spring protests by sending troops into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4 to sweep away demonstrators. The official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. It is unclear to what extent <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> may have been secretly supporting the pro-democracy movement. So far, the official charges against him have been vague. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, officially purged after the June 4 crackdown, has been accused of supporting the movement and `` counterrevolutionary turmoil.'' However, his specific wrongdoings have not been spelled out. More recently, the state-run media have accused him of responsibility for high prices and widespread corruption. Thousands of students and other supporters of the pro-democracy movement have been arrested in past months.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Aug. 1 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kidnap of Sheik Obeid: An unnecessary gamble by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security forces has apparently backfired into a grisly execution. A violent seizure ended in violent death, if a news report is true, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can not justify a means that provokes a tragic end, regardless of the intent. The casualty of this risky kidnapping was not just a failed negotiation, but a human being, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a man assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' peacekeeping force in the region. Israelis did n't take <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> prisoner in February of 1988, nor did Israelis cruelly string him up and strangle him. Yet <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has to bear some of the responsibility for what happened. The tactic of kidnapping Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, an influential Shiite Moslem cleric, was apparently done in hopes of exchanging three captured <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and other foreign hostages. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is considered by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials as a spiritual leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militia, an umbrella group for factions believed to be holding 17 hostages, nine of them Americans. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is also tied to the <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> kidnapping. ... The risks were tremendous. If the mission had succeeded and the hostages and soldiers were handed over in return for <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be muted, but it still ought to occur. The tactic itself is open for judgment. Much of the world supports <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s struggle for survival. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ought to examine this aspect of its struggle.

The plane crashed landed just short of the runway, flipped and broke apart. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> reminded reporters and others of the 111 people who died in the crash and the importance of determining the cause and trying to avoid such disasters in the future. He modestly said the four crew members just `` did their job.'' He should also remember that in doing so, they saved 185 lives.

 Officials urged people to stay out of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s fire-ravaged backcountry and evacuated vacationers near the scorched town of <LOCATION> Lowman </LOCATION>, while one fire jumped a river and temporarily closed a major highway. Cooler weather helped firefighters in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and crews contained <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s only major blaze. But officials feared lightning could trigger a new round of fires like the ones that have been burning since the middle of last week. Waves of thunderheads caused an estimated 2,000 lightning strikes an hour early Tuesday in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> alone. The thunderstorms let up later and there was no immediate word of any new fires. About 1,200 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, were to begin heading to lines in southeastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> today after getting a one-day crash course in cutting containment lines, fort spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Polich </PERSON> said. In addition, four 20-man crews and three helicopters were to head to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> today after an 850-acre fire in northern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was contained. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said about 20,000 firefighters were on lines in the West, primarily in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Blazes have blackened more than 175,000 acres in those states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Some of the firefighters came from as far away as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said the influx was obvious at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aiport </LOCATION>, where he waited Monday to return from the National Governors' Conference. `` I saw nothing but green pants, yellow shirts and the boots of firefighters headed West,'' he said. More than 5,000 firefighters battled uncontained fires on more than 80,000 acres of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> range and timber. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> predicted the fight could rage for a month. <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> officials evacuated 16 of the 36 residents of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a small mining town 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, as flames from the 1,000-acre Whangdoodle Fire moved to within a mile of town. `` We're telling them we feel like they're in some danger and offering to help them evacuate,'' <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukenhofer </PERSON> said. Crews carved a break line south of the town with bulldozers and used pumps to wet the area ahead of the fire, which was shooting embers two miles ahead of the flames. About 100 miles to the southeast, fires that burned on 26,000 acres and destroyed more than $ 10 million in structures at <LOCATION> Lowman </LOCATION> last weekend turned back toward the town Tuesday evening. More than 1,100 firefighters armed with 60 water engines, tankers and two bulldozers worked to protect the town. <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> officials evacuated about two dozen people from cabins just west of the town to a campground three miles away. They also evacuated two lodges outside the town, although <ORGANIZATION> Sourdough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON> said he would resist the efforts of sheriff's deputies to get him out `` They keep coming to the door to get me, and I keep telling them I lost my keys,'' he said. `` They can ask me to leave, but they ca n't force me.'' About 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, a rejuvenated 5,000-acre fire jumped the South Fork of the <LOCATION> Payette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near Banks, and billowing smoke closed <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Highway 55 temporarily, <PERSON> Bukenhofer </PERSON> said. Helicopters crisscrossed the Hell's Canyon area near the <LOCATION> Idaho-Oregon </LOCATION> line, carrying rangers who brought maps to direct about 40 hikers to the safest routes out of the backcountry. In eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, where 80,000 acres have burned, cooler, moist weather today helped crews cut lines around a 10,300-acre fire near the town of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> and fight blazes around <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Enterprise. Firefighters hoped they could turn back several big timber and range blazes, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Several smaller blazes were contained, and the spread of the bigger fires had stopped, she said. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, more than 1,300 firefighters aided by six air tankers and four helicopters struggled in steep canyons 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to encircle half of a fire that has blackened 8,200 acres of century-old brush in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Sporadic winds hampered the battle, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosalinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON>. `` It was going in a variety of different directions,'' she said. The fire, which has burned a home, a mobile home and a travel trailer and forced the evacuation of 100 campers, was started Saturday by a recreational shooter's ricocheting bullet. Three firefighters were treated for minor injuries. To the north in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> foothills, firefighters contained a blaze that burned 11,700 acres of brush and grassland and destroyed seven homes.

One father rushed to find his baby. He moved several times toward the infant's cries, only to be driven back by the smoke.

They have been waxing apoplectic about $ 30,000 in federal arts funding for an exhibit of photographs by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>. ... Their outrage is understandable. One of the photos was of a man urinating into another man's mouth. A $ 15,000 grant to photograher <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, now notorious for his shot of a crucifix in urine, is also getting panned. All that these politicians needed to say was that some artistic expressions are so revolting to most Americans that tax dollars are not going to subsidize them. ... But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would n't leave it at that. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted last week to place a five-year ban on federal grants ... while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wants to cut overall funding for the arts by $ 45,000.

However, a lot of capital gains are realized on activities that contribute nothing more to the economy's productive capacity: sales of art and antiques; stock and real-estate speculation; and tax shelters. Worst of all, from the standpoint of tax fairness, the primary capital gains earners already tend to be the wealthiest of the taxpayers _ the top 5 percent, by most estimates. Democratic opposition to the tax cut, however, is now flagging. ... A Democratic `` Gang of Six'' on -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- recently defected.

This was an indomitable man at the press conference at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a man you'd guess has n't yet counted his cuts and bruises, and used a wheelchair only to humor his doctor. The mid-air crisis that crippled Captain <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' jumbo jetliner held him and his crew in tortured suspension for nearly an hour. The challenge to stay aloft, to reach an airport, to attempt a safe landing, was beyond the imagining of most of us. He did it with mental toughness, methodically, calmly, with knowing trust in his own ability and intuition. And he made it all work until seconds before touch down, when lack of precise control, or perhaps a runway crosswind, dropped one wing into the ground. The aircraft cartwheeled and the fore and aft section disintegrated among trailing flames. But 185 of Captain <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' passengers survived. Air safety authorities labeled it a heroic and miraculous piloting job. His own matter-of-fact declaration that there was no hero, only people doing their jobs, fit him becomingly. Not many people are capable, but he gives the impression that many more could be.

 July 28 Daily Record, <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on a national environmental policy: If President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> really wants to be the `` environmental president,'' he could start by developing an environmental policy. What we have now is federal regulatory bureaucracy pushing stringent environmental standards in response to public concern, while the economic facts of life make meeting those standards near impossible. Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, speaking before a joint session of the environmental and public works subcommittees on environmental protection, said his city is under court order to spend $ 560 million on clean water projects to meet federal standards. Disarray can also be seen in comparing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s June 12 clean air proposal with the administration bill that followed it. Critics contend the bill falls short of the rhetoric on almost every point. We need a national policy that commits us to a goal of reduced pollution and cleaning up existing pollution. It needs to be realistic, too, recognizing that while cost of not cleaning the environment is our eventual destruction, the cost of cleaning up is no small potatoes.

Aside from whatever value preserving tradition may hold, keeping metal bats away from major league baseball makes common sense. Despite its many changes in recent years, baseball remains pretty much the same game it has always been. For that reason, fans can reasonably argue whether <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> is a better hitter than <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> was and whether <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Feller </PERSON> could make it in today's big leagues But aluminum bats would change the game much more drastically than even the designated hitter has changed it. Because they have a larger sweet spot than wooden bats, aluminum bats can turn mediocre hitters into good ones and good ones into superior ones. Thus, aluminum bats would change baseball in a fundamental way. But they would n't improve it. On the contrary, giving hitters unprecedented new clout would upset the delicate balance between pitcher and batter that gives baseball some of its drama and makes it so much fun. Aluminum bats do n't break, and that makes them suitable for sandlot leagues, which have to worry about money. But they do n't belong in the senior circuit

 Twenty consultants earned more than $ 5.7 million by helping funnel much of the money in a federal housing program to developers in a handful of states that did n't need it, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee was told today. Most of the 20 consultants were former employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> and Urban Development or well-connected Republicans, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The consultants were paid by developers to help them get about one-fifth of the money from a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program to repair housing for the poor. `` It's so lucrative now that you're going to get some people doing some pretty unsavory things to feed at that trough,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Terner </PERSON>, president of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. Elsewhere on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> today, the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing voted 6-0 to subpoena <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a former aide to former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had been scheduled to voluntarily testify last week, but did not appear, saying that he was n't prepared with legal counsel And on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, the two party leaders sparred over the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal, with Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, saying the department was `` used as a political slush fund where political appointees gave favors ... to politically well-connected individuals.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also criticized the leadership of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for not heeding the warnings of the inspector general. Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., then complained that appointments to several of the appointments to those posts have been bottled up awaiting confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` Let's make certain we understand that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has n't been very cooperative,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Now we've got a situation where Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is trying to do the right thing, and he does n't have anybody on board.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 17-0 today to approve one of those appointees, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, as an assistant <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary. The nomination of Ms. <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, who would replace <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, one of the central figures in the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal, now goes to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who conducted the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> study at the request of Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the well is starting to run dry for the outside consultants `` During our survey, five developers informed us that because of all the recent media attention, some billings were not paid in full'' to them, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> wrote in his report. One of those consultants was <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, ambassador-designate to <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, who has had $ 45,000 in payments withheld since April, the report said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is no relation to the president but was the chief fund-raiser for his 1988 campaign, was paid $ 215,000 to help land <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds for developers. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former assistant to then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, made nearly $ 1.7 million _ more than any other consultant found by <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' inquiry. Others included former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, who got $ 300,000; former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary and now <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, who received $ 138,445; and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, a lobbyist and Republican political strategist, who got $ 442,000. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has reported before on the use of consultants in obtaining funds from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, but the new report is the first attempt to determine the extent and expense of the practice. Under the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program, developers were eligible for tax credits and could get <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to subsidize the rent of tenants who otherwise could n't afford it. `` Developers often received windfall profits through tax credit syndication,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> wrote. Excess payments for rent subsidies could cost the government more than $ 413 million by 1999, he said. In all, 51 projects with a total of 7,268 apartments funded since October 1983 used consultants, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' report found. That accounts for about 20 percent of all <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s work in this area during that time. Of those projects involving consultants, 45 were put in states _ notably, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> _ that would not have qualified for the funds if <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s formulas for determining eligibility had been used, the report said. But the two largest states, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, were shortchanged by about 27 percent each, the report said. Meanwhile, a related study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said developers were willing to pay high fees to the consultants because the structure and oversight of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs made them virtually no-lose propositions. `` In this manner developers were able to realize substantial gains on their limited investments while undertaking very little risk,'' wrote <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ols </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who prepared the report.

 Police today shot and killed a black man during a raid on his house and said the Soviet-made arms they found there indicate that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas are smuggling arms into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Kierie du Rand, chief inspector of the South African-ruled territory, said the suspected guerrilla, <PERSON> Petrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, was shot in the northern border town of <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION> when he brandished a pistol while trying to escape after his arrest. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> said police found Soviet-made explosives, a detonator and a hand grenade in <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s home in the town 180 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> contingent monitoring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence could not be located to accompany the police patrol on its mission, <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> said He said the incident proves <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas are crossing the border from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where their bases are, to establish arms caches in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops are unable to monitor the situation. Under a multinational agreement linked to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas are to remain at bases at least 100 miles inside <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> or return to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as unarmed civilians. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> have accused the South African-led territorial police of harassing and intimidating the movement's supporters. More than 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military and police personnel have been deployed in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to supervise the campaign leading to pre-independence elections in November. <LOCATION> SWAPO </LOCATION>, which began a bush war against <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African rule in 1966, is favored to get the most votes in the election.

<TEXT>
 The nation's hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rulers have allowed the domestic branch of the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> writers' club to reopen, and its board will include banned and officially-sanctioned authors, participants said today. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klima </PERSON>, a dissident writer, said he and about 20 colleagues gathered Tuesday in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and elected a new club governing committee. He said both he and banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> are included in the panel. <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> himself was banned after the 1968 reforms known as the `` Prague Spring'' were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion. The Czech branch of the international writers' club became dormant around 1971 in the wake of broad purges of party members, including many writers. Police detained <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> for about three hours Tuesday but released him in time to allow him to appear at the end of the meeting, <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> and another participant said. Two members of the human rights group Charter 77, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanturkova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simecka </PERSON>, were summoned to police for questioning to coincide with Tuesday's meeting, thus preventing their attendance, <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said. However, the official news agency, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, signaled authorities' approval of the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> club project by briefly reporting that it was being formed again <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said 10 writers were elected to the club's governing committee, or board of directors: six dissident or non-conformist writers and four older, officially-backed writers. The <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> report did not discuss the board's makeup. One of the official writers, <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mucha </PERSON>, was elected chairman in what <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> described as a compromise between the official and banned writers. The efforts to restart the PEN club are the first such joint initiative in Czech literature in almost 20 years. <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said he saw it as `` a very good sign'' that the club was permitted to resume activity. He said he hopes it can negotiate with authorities on publishing previously banned books and lifting curbs on banned writers. Over the past year, authorities have made small shifts toward liberalizing the arts. Books by <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> have appeared for only the second time in 20 years, and a number of previously banned films, plays and rock bands were allowed to be seen. Writers such as <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, however, have remained banned because of their refusal to renounce political activities, according to officials. In May, the 60-chapter international PEN association voted unanimously to admit a Russian chapter, ending a long quarrel with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet participation in the 10,000-member group has been an issue ever since PEN _ an acronym for Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists _ turned down an application by the Soviet state in 1924. PEN, which champions freedom of speech for writers, had kept out the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of its persecution of writers and other intellectuals. <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said the Czech club will hold its first annual meeting next year.

<HEAD>Student Expelled for Leading University Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A student who defied martial law regulations by helping stage a demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> last month has been expelled and refused his diploma, university officials said. A public announcement, posted on bulletin boards once festooned with the posters of the student-led pro-democracy movement, said <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayong </PERSON>, 22, had broken regulations banning unauthorized gatherings. With no diploma and an expulsion on his record, <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON> probably will have difficulty finding work. The notice, dated July 25, said <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON>, a fourth-year student of Chinese and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, `` incited other students to cause trouble by breaking martial law restrictions.'' It also accused <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON> of being a `` known criminal,'' stealing three bicycles this summer and causing a drunken brawl last year. On July 23, 300 to 400 students sang and beat pots and pans to mourn classmates killed June 3-4, when troops moved into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to crush the pro-democracy movement. The students said they held the demonstration because they felt oppressed by ideological study classes they were forced to attend following the crackdown and because some of them were refused permission to join the work units they were assigned to. Most college graduates in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are assigned jobs by the government. Most of the 32,000 graduates from 80 universities and colleges in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this year have been accepted by their assigned units, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported today. The report said more than 1,000 graduates, however, had not found appropriate jobs, in part because some companies had dropped plans to accept hundreds of students. The report did not say whether the refusals were due to political considerations arising from the pro-democracy demonstrations, which began in April and were initiated and led by students from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities. Also today, Chinese newspapers said the government announced it would inspect the nation's 14.5 million private businesses in a bid to recover almost $ 5 billion in revenues lost through tax evasion. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> will check the books and tax registrations of private industrial, commercial and service enterprises in August and September for signs of tax evasion or other illegal activities, newspapers reported. Tax bureau director <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON> said illegal businesses would be closed and illegal income confiscated. The government also is cracking down on corrupt tax collectors, who are now prohibited from accepting gifts from tax-free and tax-reduced businesses to help `` ensure an honest and clean government,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The restrictions are part of a national anti-corruption drive triggered by the student democracy movement, which included demands for an end to official corruption.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani to be Sworn in as President Thursday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> will be sworn in as the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s fifth president on Thursday, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported Wednesday. The broadcast said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s credentials will be presented in a ceremony to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, the incumbent president who took over as the country's spiritual leader after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death June 3. Although <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s second four-year term does n't expire until October, he had been expected to step down sooner. The state-run radio report, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, did not say whether Thursday's ceremony meant that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> would start his duties as president immediately. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the 54-year-old speaker of parliament, won a landslide victory in Friday's presidential elections, capturing 94.5 percent of the vote. Constitutional reforms approved in a referendum alongside the election give him considerably enlarged powers by scrapping Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s post. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> to continue his duties as prime minister until a new cabinet is set up by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is considered a pragmatist who would like to ease tight governmental control of the economy, and resume ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The presidential elections, originally due to be held Aug. 18, were moved up about three weeks to hasten the transfer of power after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s decision to step down as president before the end of his term appeared aimed at allowing <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> move quickly to start reforming <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s sluggish economy.

 Shops were empty today, the day after the government introduced a controversial `` marketization'' plan that raised some food prices by 300 percent by cutting subsidies, newspapers reported. `` The first day after ` marketization' was a day of rest for the sales clerks in the majority of stores,'' reported the opposition daily <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> in an article entitled, `` Much More Expensive on the Empty Shelves.'' The government on Tuesday announced the highest official meat price increases in recent memory and the cost of other key food items also skyrocketed. Shoppers had stripped shops in late July in anticipation of the increases and August deliveries have been meager. A report today in Zycie Warszawy, an official daily in the capital, said sales clerks hoped deliveries would improve in the next two to three days. But the report added that farmers were still waiting for higher prices before delivering goods to market. `` Where is the meat?'' cried out an old man in a store on Tuesday. `` There is no meat, just the price list,'' a woman complained. In a speech to parliament today, to present his economic plan before he was elected prime minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said drastic measures would have to be adopted to prevent the danger of economic destabilization. Solidarity lawmakers charge that the policies of the previous government of <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, elected first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend, are responsible for the current economic chaos. Authorities said the increases are needed to prompt farmers to deliver their meat and produce to the market and to stabilize the level of state subsidies to the food industry. Price increases occur regularly in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but the scale of the latest boost drove many customers to despair. In the past, major price increases on food have led to rioting in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The price of pork roast, an expensive and popular cut, rose from $ 1.18 to $ 4.64 a kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB-. Sugar went up from 42 cents to 60 cents a kilogram, but was unavailable in many shops. Butter was up from 27 cents for a quarter kilogram to 48 cents. Flour increased from 7 cents a kilogram to 12 cents. The average monthly income in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is $ 127. Parliament on Monday passed legislation designed to cushion consumers from the impact of price increases, and inflation now rising at an estimated 160 percent rate annually. The law calls for incomes of workers, farmers and pensioners, to be automatically conmpensated by 80 percent of the rise in the cost of living.

In small claims court in <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> last month, <PERSON> Hendler </PERSON> was awarded the ticket price of $ 376 and $ 23 for court costs. <PERSON> Hendler </PERSON> originally sought three times the ticket price. Delta does not fear <PERSON> Hendler </PERSON>'s victory will inspire similar lawsuits, and does not plan to change its policies, <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said.

About 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s seats typically are for smokers, <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said. The carrier occasionally cancels smoking sections, but <PERSON> Hendler </PERSON> was the first to sue, <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hendler </PERSON> said that if the airline reserves seats for smokers, it should honor that commitment. `` The principle is breach of contract. That is the basis of the suit,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, struggling toward passage of a $ 295 billion defense authorization bill, voted today to pay for the war on drugs with an infusion of unspent dollars from government agencies _ including the Pentagon. The 90-9 vote, taken as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> worked into the early morning hours, would authorize the transfer of $ 1.7 billion from all but a short list of exempted federal programs to pay the full cost of keeping the government's promise to fight `` the epidemic of narcotics sweeping this country.'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the action, if approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and enacted into law, puts the problem of paying for the drug war squarely on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` This amendment authorizes the president to fund the drug package,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` It says: ` Mr. President, when it passes into law, it's your baby. You fund the war on drugs. If you do n't like it, find another way.' In other action before adjourning at 2:50 a.m. EDT, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: _ Voted to give air police last-resort permission to shoot down aircraft flying narcotics into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ Adopted a series of `` burden-sharing'' amendments aimed at increasing the contributions to defense by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> _ Bolstered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bid to make the MX missile a moving rather than a stationary target by shelving, 62-38, an amendment slicing $ 502 million from the funds available to place the force of 50 missiles on railway cars _ Turned aside an attempt to bring to an immediate vote an amendment restoring the military pension lost when former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was convicted on three felony counts in the Iran-Contra affair As a compromise, it ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to hold hearings and report on the contentious issue by Nov. 1. When the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resumed consideration of the defense bill this morning, lawmakers voted 53-44 to turn aside an amendment that would earmark $ 100 million for the effective deployment of 100 ground-based interceptors in Grand Forks, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, by 1995. The interceptors, part of the Accidental Launch Protection System, would be used against sudden terrorist missile attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also voted 84-13 to limit the number of amendments on the defense bill to those that are germane to the subject, thus shortening debate. Lawmakers took that step after an amendment regarding tests of anti-satellite systems was deemed not germane to the defense bill because of technical reasons. After a rancorous debate earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> declined to support an amendment to siphon $ 450 million from the authorization for the Star Wars strategic defense initiative for the war on drugs. Instead, it approved the compromise drafted by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as a desperation move to guarantee the drug war will be fully funded <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said his amendment would keep the promises of the drug bill passed last year by shifting unspent balances in federal programs left over at the end of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The measure exempts entitlement programs, including Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, and subsidized housing. But all other government programs and agencies would be compelled to contribute. `` This is not the best way to fund the drug bill and I hope another way will be found,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` But this will do the job. `` This says, before you spend money on other things you've got to fund the drug bill.'' Several senators complained that such popular programs as student aid and education for the handicapped would be `` sharply and severely'' cut by the amendment. But Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del. told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` I'm a realist.

<HEAD>Study Raises New Concern About Estrogen-Breast Cancer Link</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women who try to reduce their risk of fractures and heart disease by taking estrogen supplements for many years after menopause may slightly increase their chances of breast cancer, a study concludes. Some experts said doctors may have to consider the possibility of cancer when weighing the risks and benefits of putting women on estrogen after menopause. However, they caution that the evidence of a cancer link is still weak. `` In my opinion, the data are not conclusive enough to warrant any immediate change in the way we approach hormone replacement,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett-Connor </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The study, based on 23,244 Swedish women, found that users had a 10 percent overall increase in their risk of breast cancer after six years of taking the hormone. However, the risk varied, depending on the kind of estrogen that women used. Those who took estradiol, the most commonly used variety in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, had nearly double the usual risk of breast cancer. But the researchers found no increased risk among the relatively small numbers who used conjugated estrogens, which are most frequently prescribed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Doctors often prescribe estrogen in combination with the hormone progestin in the belief that this will minimize any increase in the risk of uterine cancer, which also is associated with estrogen use. However, the Swedish study raised the possibility that this combination may actually heighten the risk of breast cancer. Women in the study who had used the combination for more than six years had four times the usual risk of breast cancer, but the number of women studied was too small to be statistically meaningful. `` This article raises concern about the new regimens,'' noted Dr. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sloan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epidemiology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Combination therapy is becoming increasingly popular and recommended.'' The study, like other research, found no danger from brief use of estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms during menopause. The study was directed by Dr. <PERSON> Leif </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergkvist </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Uppsala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. Evidence of a link between estrogen and breast cancer is conflicting. More than 20 studies have found no sign of an association, but a few others suggest there may be a link. Estrogen is widely prescribed to older women to reduce their risk of heart disease and to stop osteoporosis, which leads to broken bones. Some doctors recommended that women take the hormone for the rest of their lives. `` This is an important public health question,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennekens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The breast cancer finding, if confirmed, would certainly be something that the physician would have to weigh in deciding whether to give estrogen.''

 More than 200 black and Indian patients, supported by throngs of protesters, were treated at segregated white hospitals today as the anti-apartheid movement launched a nationwide defiance campaign. The campaign, in which other major protests are planned before and after next month's segregated elections, is seen as the most ambitious civil disobedience initiative in the country in nearly 30 years. `` The defiance campaign will be taken to every corner and every section of society until apartheid is unworkable,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the largest anti-apartheid labor federation, at a rally in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. At major hospitals in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, patients ranging from babies to grandmothers in wheelchairs were admitted for treatment. Hospital officials, trying to avoid confrontations, said they would not turn away anyone who appeared in genuine need of medical care. Twelve white women supporting the protest were arrested in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, but no violence was reported at any of the eight hospitals targeted by the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups that planned the defiance campaign. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s main anti-apartheid alliance before it was banned last year, told reporters the hospital protest is `` a major victory'' and praised doctors who cooperated. In the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 protesters staged an illegal demonstration near <LOCATION> Addington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> while 140 blacks and Indians, under the direction of senior anti-apartheid leaders, were admitted for out-patient care. `` Apartheid Makes Us Sick,'' said one of the posters carried at the rally. The first protester to enter <PERSON> Addington </PERSON> was <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagga </PERSON>, an elderly Indian woman in a wheelchair. By midday, 48 blacks were admitted to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, according to a spokesman, and 100 supporters staged a rally at an adjoining medical school. Like <PERSON> Addington </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> regularly admits some blacks for emergency care and specialized treatment, but it has a policy of transferring them to less well-equipped black hospitals as soon as feasible. Dr. <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Broekmann </PERSON>, superintendent of <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, said about 11 percent of his 830 current patients were black. <PERSON> Dasoo </PERSON> noted that the blacks were admitted within an hour at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> General, much quicker than the normal processing time at badly overcrowded <ORGANIZATION> Baragwanath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the region's main facility for black patients The campaign that began today is widely viewed as the most ambitious in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since a sporadic but long-running campaign in the 1950s to encourare defiance of apartheid laws. Those protests ended in March 1960, when police gunfire killed 69 blacks participating in a peaceful demonstration against the now-abolished pass laws that restricted blacks' freedom of movement. Anti-apartheid groups have organized several one-day or two-day nationwide general strikes in recent years and a widespread hunger strike early this year by hundreds of detainees resulted in the release of virtually all of them. Hospital segregation, however, has never before been the target of coordinated protests. The protests today were smaller or non-existent at the six targeted hospitals outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Activists said some would-be protesters were stopped at police roadblocks. Nine blacks were admitted to a white hospital in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, 15 in <LOCATION> Vereeniging </LOCATION> and a few others in the conservative mining town of <LOCATION> Krugersdorp </LOCATION>, where medical segregation has been enforced firmly. `` Without intervention such as this, these people would n't even get to see a doctor,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a white activist who was at <LOCATION> Paardekraal </LOCATION>. Protest organizers said their goal is not merely to enable some blacks to get treatment at the white hospitals but to abolish the use of race as a criterion for obtaining health care. <PERSON> Dasoo </PERSON> said he and his colleagues would `` protest most strongly'' if blacks admitted to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> General today were transferred to segregated black hospitals later. Large contingents of police were deployed at the targeted hospitals, and 12 white women of the Black Sash civil rights group were arrested in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> while staging an outdoor demonstration protesting segregated hospitals. They later were released, and police said a decision would be made whether they would be charged with violating laws restricting outdoor protests.

 Tropical Storm Dean developed into a hurricane with winds of 78 mph today as it surged westward toward the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. At noon EDT, the second hurricane of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season was centered near 17.5 degrees north latitude and 59.5 degrees west longitude, or 425 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, rushing westward across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> at 20 mph. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Lesser Antilles from <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. A hurricane watch was in effect for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>. `` It's very warm water. There's not anything in the atmosphere to cause it to break up, so basically it looks good for further development,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` Right now, it's away from any land area, but it could affect the easternmost islands of the Lesser Antilles within the next 6 to 12 hours. Rainfall of 5-10 inches and tides 3 to 5 feet above normal were possible. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> could be in danger in three or four days from <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, which is called a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> storm because it formed off the west coast of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` When we see a hurricane like that we realize that it has the potential to move all the way across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and threaten the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said hurricane center forecaster <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON>, the first hurricane of the season, was downgraded to a tropical depression Tuesday night after hitting <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, midway between <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>. It was blamed for at least two deaths. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> began Monday as the fifth tropical depression of the season. It became a named storm Monday night when its winds reached 39 mph.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, halfway through a record year, opened contract talks today with union leaders who say they want a wage increase to replace all or some of the productivity bonuses of the past six years. Negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents 57,800 workers in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, began by tradition in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. `` All we want is our fair share,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON>, a Machinists business representative in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. Aerospace industry analysts say the union is in a strong position because of a $ 67 billion backlog of commercial airplane orders, $ 346 million in profits in the first half of 1989 and a shortage of skilled workers that forced <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> to borrow 600 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees earlier this year. Analysts said the chance of a strike is small among <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers. `` This is the opportunity of a lifetime to get all the overtime they can,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Deatherage </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Union officials say they want a wage increase, likely to be in the double-digits, to replace all or some of the yearly bonuses that have ranged from 3 percent to 12 percent since 1983. The current three-year contract expires Oct. 3. Except for welders, the people who make <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes earn $ 8.88 to $ 18.42 an hour. The average wage is $ 13.50 to $ 14 an hour. `` All the signals are that it looks good for us. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> can well afford to pay an increase in wages and increase benefits,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union District 751 president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> refused to comment on the negotiations.

 A train loaded with 1,350 tons of relief supplies for famine-wracked southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> will start its long-delayed mission Sunday, the country's relief commissioner said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawki </PERSON> made the announcement a day after southern rebels cleared the way for the departure by guaranteeing the train's safety Bandits and hungry villagers attacked two previous trainloads of food and other relief goods as they rolled through rebel-held territory, seizing much of the supplies. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials organizing Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, a relief operation to prevent 100,000 starving deaths during the current rainy season, had vowed that the third convoy would not move without assurances of safety from the rebels.

The envoy, <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, said he also would work on winning freedom for other hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said it killed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on Monday in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to free <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israeli commandos July 28. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s defense minister, <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, today defended the abduction and said the government considered the dangers to hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before approving it. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also said interrogation of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> revealed he played a central role in <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction. After talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> agreed to intervene to seek the return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' body.

In announcing the extension for <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged a plea from <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s Lebanese wife, <PERSON> Elham </PERSON>, and cited `` friendly appeals and sincere behests.'' `` The Iranians probably are bringing immense pressure on their Lebanese surrogates, seeking to defuse the crisis generated by <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' murder,'' one <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> source in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said, speaking on condition he not be identified. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is the financial and spiritual backer of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the fundamentalist faction believed to be the umbrella for groups holding most of the 16 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Shiite source noted that <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> has used death threats in the past to back political demands but never has killed a hostage. `` Even if it was a postponement for only one minute, it's better than nothing,'' said <PERSON> Elham </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> after he converted to Islam in 1985. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 58, was acting comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. The statement announcing the reprieve was accompanied by a photograph of another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 58, a self-styled wanderer and writer kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986. It was the first picture of him released since March 8. There are four other Americans among the foreigners held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> today repeated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s offer to swap <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and Lebanese Shiite Moslem prisoners held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and the foreigners held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is reported to be a leader, has rejected a swap. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> admitted under interrogation that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' three abductors were at his home in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> the night before the kidnap He quoted <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> as saying the kidnappers' car was hidden in his garage for a month. Earlier reports said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was held for two days in <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s house <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the kidnap of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was approved two months ago, after `` every grain of possibility for dialogue'' had been exhausted on winning the release of three Israeli POWs captured in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We took into consideration all the possible reactions,'' he said. `` We saw them all, including the actions that already took place, and ones even worse.'' Energy Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> later told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, however, that the decision to approve the kidnap did not rest on outside implications. `` Consideration was only given to getting our soldiers back,'' he said. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president-elect, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, discussed the <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> abduction and <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' purported death with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> voiced `` deep regret over what has happened and confirmed that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does not have -LRB- any -RRB- relation to the tragedy ...'' It said both men favored `` urgent measures'' to prevent the situation from worsening. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, claimed today <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> directly controls the groups holding hostages and that he dispatched his brother to help oversee their activities, including the `` execution'' of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet carrying 100 people made an emergency landing with its left wing and engine scraping the runway today after its landing gear jammed, officials said. No injuries were reported. A flash of flame and smoke erupted from the left wing as the jet, a new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 en route to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, touched down at <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> about 10:55 a.m. with its left landing gear up. Passengers slid down emergency chutes, and ground crews sprayed foam on the engine. `` I was thinking that this might be it,'' said a passenger, <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She said she sat next to a former flight attendant who kept her informed of what the crew was doing. `` Once I was out of the plane and on the runway and far from the plane, I started to feel OK.'' Flight 1489, carrying 94 passengers and a crew of six, was to have landed at <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> at 9:30 a.m., the airline said The plane was diverted to <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, the site of <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>'s maintenance hangar, after the instrument panel indicated the landing gear had not locked, officials said The landing was carried live by a statewide TV network of six stations. The pilot `` circled for better than an hour in an attempt to get all the gear down,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. The pilot got the nose wheel and right landing gear down, but not the left gear, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. Emergency vehicles lined the runway, awaiting the landing, and the airport closed to other traffic. Airline spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said the pilot burned off most of his fuel to reduce the risk of fire. He said there was not enough time to foam the runway beforehand. Before landing, the pilot touched the plane down briefly to test its landing gear, and that indicated the nose wheel and right landing gear were locked in proper position, said <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will investigate to determine the cause of the malfunction, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. Passenger <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> McDorman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the crew notified passengers of the problem around 9:45 a.m. and began maneuvering to free the stuck landing gear. `` They would drop and circle a couple of times to try and shake it free, or shake from side to side,'' Ms. <PERSON> McDorman </PERSON> said. `` It's a really weird feeling.'' She said passengers were calm. `` I kind of kidded around in the beginning and then I got really scared. When they started doing the maneuvers I said, ` This is getting serious,''' she said. But she said she believed the landing would come off without difficulty. `` I know that any pilot that's worth his salt can land an aircraft without wheels,'' she said. <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said that the plane was manufactured in November 1988. Airline records show no maintenance problems with the plane or the 737-400 series of which it is a part, he said.

<TEXT>
 Austrian conductor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> was under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over allegations of involvement in Nazi persecution, but the case against him was dropped when he died last month, a government lawyer said Wednesday. Had he lived, `` there might have been a question of the watchlist'' _ putting the famed musician on a list of people banned from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for their <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> pasts _ said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>. Among the allegations were that von <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> might have worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> security police and had a role in ridding German orchestras of Jews and other `` non-Aryans,'' said <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>. The investigation was begun several months ago, before von <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on July 16 at the age of 81, <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. `` We were looking at what his role in Nazi persecution might have been,'' said <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>. `` I do n't know where the investigation would have led, but there might have been a question of the watchlist.'' Thousands of people have been placed on the list, including Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. The office investigated him in 1986 and reached a finding that played a role in Nazi persecution during World War II while he served as an intelligence officer. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> joined the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1933 in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and then rejoined in 1934 when he moved to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. Under the sponsorship of <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Goering </PERSON>, the field marshal who founded the Gestapo, <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s career flourished. `` He was the cultural showpiece of the most horrendous regime ever. At the time they were throwing people in the ovens he was holding concerts,'' <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. To say von <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> was just an artist `` is a revisionist view of history,'' <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. For two years after the war ended in 1945 von <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> was banned from performing by the Allied powers who occupied <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, because of his collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. His first tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1954, at the head of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic which he conducted for 34 years, was greeted by widespread protests. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> was a frequent visitor to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the last time in February, <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. `` There were many questions about him that deserved answers,'' but with his death the case has been closed, he said.

<HEAD>Protest Campaign Starts; 200 Blacks Treated at `White' Hospitals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 200 blacks and Asians were treated at whites-only hospitals Wednesday as the anti-apartheid movement launched its most ambitious civil disobedience campaign in nearly 30 years. Patients ranging from babies to grandmothers in wheelchairs were admitted for treatment, most of them at hospitals in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Hospital officials, trying to avoid confrontations, did not turn away anyone who appeared in genuine need of medical care. `` We see the campaign today as a major victory,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a loosely organzied coalition of anti-apartheid groups that arranged the protests. `` We proved that we did not intend to cause violence or disrupt medical services, but to help the government remove the albatross of apartheid,'' he said at a news conference. <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> said the campaign will include other major protests before next month's segregated parliamentary elections, but refused to say what form they would take or when they would begin. The government claims the campaign is part of an effort to violently disrupt the Sept. 6 elections for the tricameral parliament which has separate chambers for whites, Asians and people of mixed race, but excludes the 28 million black majority. The Mass Democratic Movement has accused authorities of a `` hysterical response'' and has pledged that its actions will be non-violent. The last sustained defiance campaigns were conducted in the 1950s and ended in March 1960 when police shot and killed 69 blacks participating in a peaceful protest against the now-abolished pass laws that restricted blacks' freedom of movement. Anti-apartheid groups have organized several one - and two-day nationwide general strikes in recent years, and a widespread hunger strike earlier this year by hundreds of detainees resulted in the release of virtually all of them Organizers said the new campaign would last indefinitely. `` The defiance campaign will be taken to every corner and every section of society until apartheid is unworkable,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the nation's largest labor federation. Twelve white women supporting Wednesday's protest were arrested briefly in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, but no violence was reported at any of the eight targeted hospitals. In <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 protesters staged an illegal demonstration near <LOCATION> Addington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, while about 140 blacks and Indians, under the direction of senior anti-apartheid leaders, were admitted for out-patient treatment. `` Apartheid Makes Us Sick,'' said one poster carried at the rally. The first protester to enter <PERSON> Addington </PERSON> was <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagga </PERSON>, an elderly Indian woman in a wheelchair. At <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, about 50 blacks were admitted for treatment, and hundreds of supporters staged a rally at an adjoining medical school. Like <PERSON> Addington </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> regularly admits some blacks for emergency care and specialized treatment, but has a policy of transferring them to less well-equipped black hospitals as soon as feasible. Dr. <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Broekmann </PERSON>, superintendent of <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, said about 11 percent of his 830 patients were black. <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s occupancy is about 50 percent, while the only full-service hospital in the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> is so overcrowded that hundreds of patients sleep on the floors. `` As of today, the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> considers all health facilities in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> open -LRB- to all races -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Aslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dasoo </PERSON>, a doctor who helped organize the protest. The protests were smaller at the six targeted hospitals outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Activists said some would-be protesters were stopped at police roadblocks. In related developments: _ Seventeen activists in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> announced that on Sunday they will begin defying restrictions imposed on them following their recent release from detention. Like many ex-detainees, they are required to remain in their homes at night and to report daily to police. _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineworkers </ORGANIZATION> said its members are attempting to use facilities reserved for whites, including bathrooms, cafeterias and buses. Under apartheid, the 5 million whites control the country's political system and the economy and maintain segregated neighborhoods and schools

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> urged a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday to ratify an international anti-drug trafficking treaty. The pact will `` provide us with enhanced law enforcement tools and can lead to substantial advances in our international cooperative efforts'' to counter the illegal drug market, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The attorney general signed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illicit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances on behalf of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last December in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The treaty includes a provision under which `` all the nations signing the convention have agreed to exchange evidence of criminal conduct and to extradite accused traffickers so that safe havens are no longer so readily available,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> noted in response to questions from Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, that the treaty does not obligate countries to extradite their own nationals wanted on drug-related charges in other countries. `` The convention in and of itself is not going to provide a remedy to the extradition problem of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' where the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> several years ago declared unconstitutional its extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that allowed drug traffickers to remain there when they were wanted on charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. In addition, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, Jr., D-Del., that the treaty would allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to withhold investigative information from governments it perceives to be corrupt, even if they have signed the document `` I think we would have no hesitation about doing that ...,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` Our obligation to our own citizens would transcend'' the treaty requirement to share information. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the president would decide whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should seek extradition of someone overseas wanted on drug charges here when the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't want that to occur. `` I have not had such a case arise,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>. `` The obvious instinct of a prosecutor ... is to prosecute. However, all of us recognize the prosecutions may have to be foregone for national security reasons.'' <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitsky </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, attended the hearing but did not comment. Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by two federal grand juries on drug-trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last year, before <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> became attorney general. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reportedly offered to drop the criminal charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he would step down from power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The treaty calls for extradition of accused drug traffickers and the exchange of law enforcement information. It also seeks to lift `` the veil of bank secrecy'' to help uncover money-laundering operations, requires supervision of the manufacturing and sale of chemicals used in the production of illegal drugs, mandates that commercial carriers ensure their cargos are free of drugs, and reaffirms the need for aggressive efforts in crop eradication and demand reduction, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The agreement requires each signatory to pass laws outlawing drug trafficking and money laudering while enabling the countries to seize drug profits, but the laws of each country would take precedence. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> noted that all legislation by each country is `` subject to their constitutional principles and basic concepts of their legal systems.'' The treaty, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, `` will assist in the eradication of drugs and drug-producing laboratories, and in preventing the transportation of precursor chemicals from this nation and others to the drug-producing countries for use in drug production. `` The convention will also help to hinder the importation of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and prevent the transfer of the profits of the illegal drug trade back to the drug cartels,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> got a cool reception from a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman Wednesday when he sought support for proposals emphasizing parental involvement that he said are needed to revitalize school systems. Although initiatives outlined by <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> have been embraced in principle by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> education panel and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., made clear he was not impressed <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, chairman of the Education and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> he sees `` some dangerous trends in the proposals being advocated.'' For example, he characterized what he called a `` so-called parental choice'' approach to school selection for their children as `` a very dangerous idea that has not been fully scrutinized.'' On the administration proposal to encourage a new category of magnet schools targeted at school systems with major dropout and drug abuse problems, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said that `` takes us far afield from trying to improve schools for all children rather than a few.'' `` The selling of choice reminds me of the medicine man selling snake oil,'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. The veteran committee chairman has been a major force in most of the federal education legislation passed in recent years. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said: `` We have been aware of -LRB- problems -RRB- for a long time, but nothing has happened. We have got to start changing the system itself. What I'm trying to do is open up to this nation the whole idea of restructuring our education system and I think choice is a major part of that.'' In his prepared testimony, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> had said, `` The fact that we now outspend most countries in education does not, in any way, make up for the fact that when it comes to solid results, our students and our schools overall simply are n't cutting it.'' While not disputing committee figures that the federal share of education spending has dropped from 8 percent to 6 percent over the past decade, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said inflation-adjusted spending by all levels of government is up 26 percent since 1982 _ to $ 199 billion last year on elementary and secondary education alone. Outlining the federal role as mainly one of stimulating education approaches with the best chance of working, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said: `` We have not made progress by putting in more money. We need to totally change the system. We just can not go on doing it the way we are doing it now.'' Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, D-Mich., said he was concerned about many administration proposals because `` I think what we're talking about is reversing our commitment to desegregation. While not attacking <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' proposals specifically, <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON> cited the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection Tuesday of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for the top civil rights job at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` reading signs'' in the executive and judicial branch of a general relaxation of devotion to civil rights. `` This a great worry to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>. The main program in the proposed legislation that drew <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' criticism would authorize $ 100 million a year to promote what <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> called `` open enrollment through parental choice'' as a new category of magnet schools that would not necessarily be intended to promote desegregation or attract only top scholars `` Magnet schools work,'' said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, and `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I want to find ways to expand magnet schools and other examples of choice all across this country.'' The legislation also would enable the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to study other `` choice'' programs and recommend those that work best. The secretary complimented <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' home state and said, `` Several models of choice are being implemented in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, including schools-within-a-school and special schools with a subject matter focus. Interdistrict choice is allowed if both school districts involved agree.''

 A former Tamil rebel leader traveled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Wednesday to help negotiate an accord on withdrawing Indian peacekeeping troops from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> met with Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> for two hours. The spokesman said the former Tamil rebel, <PERSON> Vartharaja </PERSON> <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON>, and five other ethnic Tamils from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> would be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Thursday for consultations but would not take part in the talks. Perumal is chief minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. On this island off <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern coast, more ethnic violence was reported. In central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, Sinhalese extremists have killed seven people since Tuesday, military sources said. Sinhalese radicals have carried out an anti-India campaign to protest the presence of about 45,000 Indian peacekeepers in the Tamil-dominated north and east. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, fire destroyed 25 shops owned by Tamils of Indian descent, police said. No casualties were reported from the Tuesday night fire, the cause of which was under investigation. <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> and a six-member delegation came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Saturday to discuss a timetable for the pullout of the troops. They were deployed under a failed 1987 peace accord sponsored by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says more power must be transferred to the Tamil-dominated provincial council to fulfill the terms of the 1987 accord before its troops leave. Sinhalese extremists say the Indian troops have compromised this country's independence. They also say the government in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> has granted too many concessions to the Tamils. The government has blamed the extremists for killing at least 4,000 people, mostly officials of the government and its supporters. About 11,000 other people have died in the Tamil insurrection that began in 1983. In an effort to quell the violence, President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s government asked <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to withdraw its soldiers by July 29. On Saturday, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> pulled out a small number of troops, and the two countries agreed to negotiate a withdrawal for the remaining soldiers. The Tamil guerrillas are fighting for an independent homeland in the north and east. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved because its own 60 million Tamils are sympathetic to the demands of Sri Lankan Tamils, who account for 18 percent of this country's 16 million people. Tamils contend they are discriminated against in jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military.

But the six-member <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury disagreed. The jury awarded $ 50 million each to <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> after five hours of deliberations. The jury said $ 20 million should by paid by <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> and $ 40 million apiece by its chairman and its president. <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>, which offers items for sale to TV viewers, had sued in 1987, claiming it lost millions of telephone calls and about $ 500 million in potential sales because its <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> equipment was insufficient for the volume of calls. <ORGANIZATION> GETE </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, countered with a slander and libel suit blaming <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles on its own mismanagement. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> had failed to mention its plans to buy 11 UHF stations in 1986, which, combined with its entry into the cable TV market, caused subscribers to soar from 9 million to 46.5 million in one year. Competition from similar retailers also hurt <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said.

 Parliament on Wednesday approved $ 1 billion in emergency funds to battle algae that is fouling beaches on the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> coast and driving tourists away. Part of the money will be used to build water purifiers and sewage treatment plants along the coast and to reduce the amount of agricultural pollutants coming from the <LOCATION> Po </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The decree, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, passed the Chamber of Deputies by a 320-19 vote, with 17 legislators abstaining. The algae has dealt a serious blow to the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> tourism industry, creating a dirty sea and deserted beaches.

 Rock star <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> says he no longer cares for his early 1970s cult hit `` Captain <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'' or his popular song `` My Life,'' which he describes as childishly redundant. `` My Life'' is `` a song that turned out sour for me ... just like some of your kids turn into bums,'' he told a master class at the <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> campus on Monday. `` Captain <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>,'' a song about adolescent drug abuse, `` kind of burned me out quick,'' he added. The master class was open to the public and included <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> made it clear his professional career, not his private life, was the topic of the day. `` Usually, somebody wants to know, ` What does <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> look like in the morning?''' he said, referring to his wife, model <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>. `` She looks good, so let's get that out of the way.'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> said he writes his music first, composing the melody to what he called `` bail-out lyrics'' that establish a song's phrasing. As he was working on the first verse of `` Just the Way You Are,'' he said, the lyrics went: `` Do n't be crazy, do n't be lazy Do n't bring me chicken soup alone. I'm not hungry, I'm not thirsty ...'' Later, when he wrote the real words, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> said, he thought the phrase `` What will it take'til you believe in me _ The way that I believe in you'' was essential to its success. `` That edge of anxiety made it a more meaningful song,'' he said. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, who signed a contract as a young musician that gave away his rights to his early songs, said his advice to newcomers to the field was `` to get a lawyer.'' `` Then I'd tell them to hire another lawyer to watch the first lawyer. `` There's a great deal of dishonesty and greed, and musicians tend to be naive about this business,'' he said.

<HEAD>GE To Hold Back Freon to Offset Releases From Refrigerator Repairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to hold back up to 300,000 pounds of ozone-depleting freon to offset the release of the gas from a refrigerator repair program, it was announced Wednesday. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., who negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> officials, said the arrangement was `` breaking new ground,'' because it would mean `` real reductions in the volume of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s -LRB- chlorofluorocarbons -RRB- now being released into our air. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s appliance division in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said he expected the offset would take place next year after completion of the program to replace compressors in nearly a million large-size refrigerators sold in 1987-88. GE is replacing the compressors, which drive the coolant system, in customers' homes. But during that process, about five ounces of freon are released. The freon joins other <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s in floating towards the stratosphere, where the chemicals can destroy the paper-thin ozone layer. While ozone is the chief ingredient of smog when close to the ground, it protects against ultraviolet radiation at higher levels. If a hole in the ozone layer develops and increased radiation comes through, it could cause more cases of skin cancer and eye cataracts, depressed human immune systems and reduced crop yields, according to scientists and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s also have been implicated in global warming, in which the earth's heat is trapped, causing temperature increases, droughts, heat waves and a rise in sea levels. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has introduced legislation to reduce and eventually ban ozone-depleting chemicals, which already are headed for a 50 percent worldwide reduction by the end of the century under an international agreement. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the company has n't decided exactly how to offset the releases caused by repairs, but added that the firm has pledged to `` take off the marketplace the amount we use in the -LRB- replacement -RRB- program.'' He said the company initiated the replacement program voluntarily in January after testing showed that certain compressors would not last the required 10 years. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and an official of an environmental research group told a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> could have done more by using special equipment to recapture the freon during repairs instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. `` We are deeply disappointed by the company's refusal to stop routine releases of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to GE. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also was involved in the negotiations. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said portable machines that could recapture the freon on the spot are not widely available and are unable to recycle the gas during the repair process. The negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> began after <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ellicott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, complained when the freon was released in her kitchen. `` I was totally outraged,'' she said. <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> said she contacted the public interest group after calls to <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> brought no satisfactory response. The public interest organization then contacted <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Wildfires Threaten Idaho Hamlets, Burn 215,000 Acres in West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Flames pushed within 300 yards of the rustic <ORGANIZATION> Sourdough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> and theatened two <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> hamlets Wednesday, but cooler weather was turning the tide against some of the wildfires buring in five western states. `` It all depends on the wind,'' said Sourdough owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON>, who refused to leave his inn outside <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON>. `` If we do n't get any wind, we could walk away from this thing heads high. If the wind changes, my friend, this is going to be one big black hole.'' Wildfires have consumed more than 215,000 acres _ or 335 square miles _ of timber, brush and grassland in the West since the middle of last week, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the government's wildfire command post. Most were ignited by lightning. Big fires continued to burn Wednesday in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, while smaller blazes were fought in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, moist, cool air slowed the flames' advance. `` Those conditions really help suppression,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` But then its supposed to get hotter again by the weekend so we've got to get something done before then.'' More than 15,000 firefighters were on the lines throughout the West, and reinforcements continued to arrive from outside the region and from the military. Fifteen buses carrying 500 soldiers left the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> on Wesdnesday to join the battle in eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The soldiers, who got a crash course in fire safety, were to be joined by 500 more troops Thursday, said Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, spokesman for the fort south of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where 94,000 acres of timber and range have burned, crews had to concentrate on protecting structures scattered throughout the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> national forests rather than on containing the flames. `` They save the structures first and fight the fires second,'' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Air tankers were dumping flame-retardant chemicals at a rate of one-quarter of a million gallons of retardant a day on the most stubborn of the blazes. <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON>, population 15, was largely leveled by flames over the weekend, and shifting winds Wednesday renewed the threat to cabins scattered near the town 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Sourdough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> was one of the few to ignore the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> advice to leave. Fire crews poured so much soap-like foam on the building that it took on a mid-winter snowy look. Even the tops of the surrounding firs were white. The fire was so hot it melted asphalt on the highway, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> 21, east and west of <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON>. Fire also neared the small mining town of <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, where 16 of the 36 residents fled and the rest prepared to move to an open area if the threat increased. Hundreds of firefighters ringed the town with 1,000 feet of hose, putting sprinklers on each building as wind sent the fire racing to within a mile of the buildings. The situation Wednesday elsewhere in the West: _ In eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, where 85,000 acres have been blackened, cool weather gave firefighters hope they could turn back several big timber and range blazes, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Several smaller blazes were contained, and the spread of the bigger fires around the towns of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Enterprise had stopped, she said. _ In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a brush fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> that has blackened 8,200 acres destroyed a house and a mobile home was 50 percent contained Wednesday. More than 1,300 firefighters supperted by air tankers and helicopters struggled in sporadic wind and tough terrain to contain the blaze 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> foothills in central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 3,000-acre fire burned out of control in grass and brush, but did n't pose a theat to structures. _ In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, firefighters were close to containing an 800-acre grass and timber fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Custer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. About 300 firefighters were working to cut lines around the blaze in the southeastern corner of the state. _ In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, firefighters were mopping up the 850-acre Lodgepole fire in the North Cascades near the Canadian border.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill Upping AIDS Spending, Blocking Sex Survey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation on Wednesday that would boost federal AIDS spending to $ 1.6 billion but block a survey of Americans' sexual habits that supporters said would help determine how such diseases spread. The measure, passed 365-58 and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, increases AIDS spending in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, by about 25 percent over this year's level. The money would be spread among research, prevention, and treatment programs. But the report accompanying the bill prohibited the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from spending $ 11 million it had planned to use for an extensive study of sexual behavior. There was no debate on the prohibition of the survey, which was included by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations labor, health and human services and education subcommittee. But the report said the survey `` does not appear to be an appropriate use of federal funds,'' and said such work, if needed, should be accomplished with private money. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is directed not to proceed with this study,'' the report said. The provisions were part of a bill providing $ 155.2 billion for labor, health and education programs. Public health officials said the sexual behavior study would allow them to learn more about how AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are spread. The Kinsey Report, conducted in 1948, was the last thorough study of American sexual practices. A pilot questionnaire composed by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sought to learn when participants had most recently had sex, what practices they engaged in and whether their partner was male or female. Some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials and conservative lawmakers have opposed the survey, arguing that it would be an invasion of privacy and that it is already clear that AIDS is spread through sexual contact. Last month, the number of Americans diagnosed as having AIDS surpassed the 100,000 mark. More than 58,000 of them have died. The legislation contains a large increase for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, which would get a $ 534 million increase over 1989 levels to $ 7.7 billion. This includes $ 1.7 billion for cancer research and $ 1.1 billion for work on heart and lung ailments. It provides $ 4.7 billion for jobs programs; $ 1.9 billion for alcohol, drug abuse and mental health programs; and $ 5.6 billion for education programs for disadvantaged students. It also grants $ 3.7 billion to the Guaranteed Student Loan program for college students. Of that amount, $ 1.9 billion is for the costs of loans on which students have defaulted.

 The smog over western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> valleys Wednesday was so unusual that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> put out a special advisory explaining to puzzled Montanans what the crud was. Visibility in <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> was only six miles Wednesday morning, virtually opaque by <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> standards. Tuesday afternoon, the visibility was 40 miles. The weather service explained that the dirty air was `` a weather phenomenon usually seen in the industrial eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` Generally speaking, high humdity, high pressure at the surface and a high concentration of industrial pollutants combine in the populated eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to produce a milky dirty sky during the day along with reduced visibilities,'' the weather service said in an advisory that goes to subscribers such as radio stations or newspapers. Smoke from <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> forest fires drifted northeast and combined with unusually humid and stagnant air over the mountains to bring a touch of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the mountains. The weather service said morning smog was expected to continue `` as long as the forest fires continue in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and as long as the westerly upper level winds continue to bring the smoke into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 In the minutes before a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed on takeoff last August, the crew joked that a plane wreck would one day expose their gleeful cockpit conversation to the public. The tape made by the cockpit voice recorder on Flight 1141 was released under a judge's order Tuesday, revealing crew member's views on news coverage of other crashes, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s politics and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s looks The conversation involved the cabin crew and a flight attendant who was forbidden by law to be in the cabin while the plane was in motion. Fourteen people were killed in the crash at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. More than 90 passengers survived. At a hearing in November, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators rigorously questioned the crew about the apparent idle nature of the conversation when they should have been going over preflight checklists. District Judge <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Canales </PERSON> released the tape over objections of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who argued the recording should be made available only to parties in liability suits stemming from the crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> already has admitted that the flight crew failed to properly set wing flaps for added lift before takeoff. The nearly 10 minutes of conversation, deemed `` casual and non-duty related'' and kept secret by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, was released at the request of <ORGANIZATION> WFAA-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The only female voice on the recording was identified by a special court master as that of flight attendant <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, who survived the crash. Some of the talk apparently took place while the plane was taxiing. Since 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has had a `` sterile cockpit'' rule that prohibits any flight crew conversation not related to the operation of the aircraft when the plane is taxiing, and when it is flying below 10,000 feet in an approach or departure. Flight attendants also are prohibited from entering the cockpit during those periods. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, today backed off a threat to have pilots turn off voice recorders until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> bars release of the recordings. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said at a news conference that he received assurances the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> will seek such legislation. Prior to the news conference, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said, `` If immediate and direct action'' is not taken, `` I will be instructing our members to deactivate their recording devices until this shameful abuse is corrected.'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said turning off the recorders would violate <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has an agreement with pilots that no enforcement action will be taken as a result of what is said on the tapes. `` They are only an investigative tool,'' <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. While the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight crew waited for takeoff, an unidentified crew member said, `` We forgot to discuss about the dating habits of our flight attendants so we could get it on the recorder in case we crashed.'' `` Then the media would have some kind of a juicy tidbit,'' the crew member said. That was a reference to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> crew members who were said to have discussed a flight attendant's dating habits before their jet crashed on takeoff in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> in 1987, killing 28 people. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> last week accepted responsibility for the crash. It also announced it had fired the flight's pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that Ms. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, who is on medical leave due to crash injuries, has not been disciplined. He refused to say if she would be subject to penalties when she returns to a full schedule. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and was bound for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after a stop at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. Crew members talked at length about the 1988 election and, in reference to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, one said, `` You know, it's scary that someone like him could get as far as he did.'' The conversation included exchanges about egrets that live at the airport and about the news coverage of plane crashes and elections. The talk also turned to vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. One criticized her looks, while another praised her oratory skills. Of reporters, Ms. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said: `` They are such vultures, they really are. They're too powerful, they really are.'' The tape ends with a scream and the sound of the plane breaking apart.

<HEAD>Report Says Price of Increased Activity Includes Likelihood of Loss
of Life</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A space shuttle will be lost and astronauts may well die within the next decade if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> carries out its vision of exploring the universe, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was warned in a report released Wednesday. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wishes to send people into space on a routine basis, the nation will have to accept the risks these activities entail,'' said the study by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. `` If such risks are perceived to be too high, the nation may decide to reduce its emphasis on placing humans in space.'' The price of increased space activity includes `` the likelihood that loss of life will occur,'' the report said. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> space science subcommittee, told a news conference that the country must not forget going into space is a risky business `` Were there to be another major disaster it would certainly shake the confidence of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who has flown in space himself. `` That was one of the ill-served byproducts of the extraordinary success of the space shuttle for 24 flights in which it became so routine in the mind of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people _ that it was almost like getting into your car and taking a Sunday afternoon drive _ when in fact it's anythin but that,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was a passenger on <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> as it made the last shuttle flight before a fireball engulfed Challenger in 1986 with a loss of seven lives. `` Let's do n't be overdramatic about this,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` It does n't have to be this horible explosion-type thing that occurred. It could be the complete elimination of an orbiter in a mistake made in preparation, a crane drops something on the fuselage and it is suddenly out of commission for two or three years.'' <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> could reduce some of the risks by building a fifth orbiter, at a cost of $ 2.5 billion, including spare parts. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said he would favor adding to the fleet, which will be brought to four ships when Endeavour _ the Challenger replacement _ is finished in 1992. The OTA report, called `` Round Trip to Orbit: Human Space Flight Alternatives,'' examines some of the policy choices <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> faces in decisions for this century and the next. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to reduce risks to the shuttle fleet during assembly of the space station, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said, it could direct <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to buy Titan 4 launch vehicles or develop a so-called Shuttle-C launch vehicle, which would use shuttle booster rockets and fuel tank to orbit a huge cargo container. The report also laid out options to advance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crew-carrying capabilities beyond the shuttle era into the next century. They include an Advanced Manned Launch System leading to an advanced shuttle-like vehicle and a Personnel Launch system, which could dispatch a crew-carrying vehicle from unpiloted launch rockets. An aerospace plane, able to take off from a runway and fly to orbit, would be a major step forward, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said, but would be much more expensive and a larger technical challenge. Space shuttle reliability to date, with one catastrophic failure in 29 launches _ the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986 _ is 96.5 percent. A contractor estimated last year that a representative chance of mission success is 98 percent. `` If reliability is and remains 98 percent, there would be a 50 percent chance of losing an orbiter on the next 34 flights, a 72 percent chance of losing an orbiter before the first space station assembly flight and an 88 percent chance of losing an orbiter before space station assembly is completed 42 flights later,'' said OTA. It said those percentages differ from the risk faced by the crew because the crew might escape in some situations where the orbiter was lost. Current plans call for all hardware for the planned space station to be carried into orbit in shuttle cargo holds, along with astronauts who will do the assembly. Engineers have been talking, though, of reducing the number of shuttle missions by carrying parts into orbit on heavy-duty rockets. `` Continued dependence on only four orbiters could be risky,'' said the report. `` Launching each orbiter three or four times every year creates a growing cumulative risk of accidents or ` wear out;' supporting the space station in addition to other crew-related missions would be difficult if not impossible with fewer than four orbiters.''

 A man arrested in a cocaine bust has become the first person charged under an <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> law requiring dealers to buy a tax stamp for their illegal drugs. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 23, is charged with cocaine possession and failure to pay the special state tax on the drugs, which were found July 3. He was freed on $ 500 bail. The law, which took effect July 1, requires purchase of tax stamps on dealer quantities of cocaine, marijuana and other drugs. Violations carry up to five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, said the arrest is the first under the law, although the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has initiated civil penalties against one person. The stamps are about 2 inches square and are green for marijuana, blue for controlled substances sold by quantity and red for those sold by dosage. The stamps cost $ 3.50 per gram for marijuana and $ 200 per gram for cocaine. The <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which issues the stamps, is prohibited from trying to establish the identity of the buyer. `` We will mail them to whatever address or post office box,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, commission chief of operations in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. `` There is absolutely no follow-up by this agency to obtain the identity of the person.'' Forty-two grams or more of marijuana and seven grams or more of cocaine require tax stamps. The commission sold 93 stamps for marijuana in July. But <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said no stamps have been purchased for any other drugs.

<TEXT>
 The director of a Chinese-American arts organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said Wednesday that none of the eight Chinese opera performers who vanished last week plans to apply for political asylum. The entertainers are `` scared to death'' by the publicity their disappearance has caused, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chow </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The fate of the entertainers, including seven opera stars and a popular actor, has been unknown since the group fled the 28-member <LOCATION> Kun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> company last week. Immigration officials in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said Wednesday they had no connect with the performers. <PERSON> Chow </PERSON>, who would say only that he has `` some connection'' with the performers, reported that four remained in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, two are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and two are in <LOCATION> Washingon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> All are staying with relatives or friends, said <PERSON> Chow </PERSON>, adding that he was uncertain whether the performers had planned to flee the opera group or acted spontaneously. Observers have speculated that the eight might be seeking democratic and economic freedoms in the wake of the student-led pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this spring. But <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> insisted that the artists will not seek asylum. It has been common for performers from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a working visa and then apply for a student visa to enable them to study in this country, he said. `` Those things always happen,'' said <PERSON> Chow </PERSON>. `` It's not too hard to change their visa to a student visa in a regular case. Now it's very bad. The performers did not know the risk they faced in seeking such a change following the government crackdown on the student movement, <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> said. `` Now they found out and they're scared to death.'' <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> met the entertainers when they performed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last month. Now, he is worried for their safety. `` It's a very bad position if you just disappear. This timing is not right. You hurt not only yourself, you hurt <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he is `` leaving no stone unturned'' in trying to free American hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> but lacks hard information as he tries to deal with the crisis `` in a prudent way.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had contacted many world leaders including British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, and `` We have had assurance after assurance ... they want to help.'' `` You can just rest assured that we're going about our business in, I'd say, a prudent way,'' he said, declining to discuss any specifics of what he had in mind. Asked at a photo session if he had information that hostages' lives might be in danger in the wake of the reported execution of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> by Shiite Moslem captors, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` We are considering that that might well be the case, given statements we have seen. `` Please assume we are thinking prudently about this matter in every way possible,'' and using diplomatic channels, the president said. `` We're leaving no stone unturned.'' However, he added, `` We're dealing with less than a full deck when it comes to information. It is very hard when you're dealing with this kind of cowardice and this kind of dastardly act to get all the information that you need to make a decision ... We are not dealing with all the facts.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if it would make matters easier if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released the leading Moslem cleric whose kidnapping inflamed the hostage situation and prompted threats against the eight Americans held captive. Without directly criticizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the president repeated his earlier call for a release of all hostages held by all parties in the region. `` I think the release of everyone held against their will would be a good thing,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the comments during a picture-taking session with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khalifa </PERSON>, the foreign minister of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. The minister condemned the reported killing of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> as an act against all humanity. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the administration is pleased with a statement Tuesday by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s President-elect <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> condemning <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' apparent execution and all acts of a terrorist nature She called on <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to act `` in accordance with the spirit'' of his statement. `` We remain convinced that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is in a position to bring significant influence to bear on those who hold the hostages and call on it to do so,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> also welcomed a statement by a top aide to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> criticizing the execution of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Asked about potential military action in light of the movement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` We're prudently planning. However, his comments seemed to indicate he has made no decisions on a plan of action. He said he was weighing the situation with `` a heavy heart'' and that `` it transcends religion, it transcends alliances, it gets in ... to a matter that concerns that entire civilized world. So we will keep on trying.'' The president is getting help from the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and seeking aid from other world leaders to try to solve the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> hostage crisis, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cautioned against hopes for a quick solution. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received his daily intelligence briefing this morning in advance of a meeting with his top national security aides to assess information coming from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announced today that <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has agreed to intervene to seek the return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of the body of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, whose reported hanging Monday by his kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> precipitated the crisis. In a 12-minute telephone call Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked the pope to intercede in getting the return of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' body if, in fact, the officer had been executed. `` His holiness expressed the willingness of the Holy See to find a solution to this problem,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said today the USS Belknap, the flagship of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 6th Fleet, and the fleet's commander canceled a scheduled visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Sevastapol </LOCATION> to be `` at the beck and call'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in case he needs them. The aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> also has cut short a visit and left the port of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, officials said. But officials played down the possibility of a military strike against hostage-holders. `` These are not necessarily bellicose moves _ but we want to be ready in case we are needed. ... These are prudent measures,'' said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The risks appear to greatly outweigh the potential payoff'' of any military strike, an official said Tuesday. And the White House went out of its way to avoid drama that would make it appear a crisis was engulfing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency. On Tuesday night the president went ahead with plans for a jovial barbecue for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members on the White House lawn. Appearing in shirtsleeves and leather-pocketed casual pants, the president dined on ribs, chatted cheerfully with his picnic-table companions and clapped to the lively tunes of the Oak Ridge Boys. `` These are not easy days, either in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or in the White House,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in brief remarks. `` There are overwhelming events that concern everybody here. But even though there are complicated times, I think an evening like this with just plain relaxation with friends is very, very significant and very important.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated a dramatic response was not imminent. Rather, he said reporters should view the situation as `` a process for dealing with the situation over the long term and not look for any quick decision points.'' `` We do n't want to create a crisis atmosphere,'' he said. Administration officials said they still had no firm confirmation that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was dead, as his <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> terrorist captors claimed Monday. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, said through a spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> she could not tell whether her husband was the man shown hanging in a grisly videotape the kidnappers released. Besides telephoning the pope, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, while other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials contacted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> seeking assistance in winning freedom for the remaining hostages. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also is going through intermediaries to seek help from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is believed to have influence with kidnappers who hold the hostages. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have formal diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would use its growing influence in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on behalf of the hostages.

 Government forces pushed back guerrilla fighters and took new territory near a stategic eastern city during fighting that killed 68 people, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. After nearly daily rocket barrages for a month, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was quiet for the second day as government forces rounded up suspected guerrilla sympathizers and seized weapons in the capital area, said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>. On Tuesday, the government said 100 rockets were confiscated in the area and 50 people were arrested. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said Wednesday that three Egyptian Sakr-30 surface-to-surface rockets also were found about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Earlier Wednesday, about 200 Moslem religious leaders and their followers demonstrated in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to protest the rocket attacks. They blamed them on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which supply weapons to the guerrillas. In <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province, government forces drove back guerrillas fighters and seized new territory, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. The provincial capital is <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, an eastern city that the guerrillas have twice failed to capture in offensives since Soviet soldiers withdrew in February. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said fighting in <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province in the last 24 hours had left 62 guerrillas dead and 93 wounded. He said six government soldiers were killed and 12 wounded. In operations east of <LOCATION> Samar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khel </LOCATION>, about 12 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, government forces conducted search operations. Large quantities of arms and ammunition were seized near <LOCATION> Chapar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Har </LOCATION> district, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. He gave no numbers. `` The general condition of the war in <LOCATION> Chapar </LOCATION> Har and <PERSON> Samar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khel </PERSON> is that the enemy is retreating,'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. `` But they are backed by the heavy artillery of the 11th Division of the Pakistani armed forces.'' Neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which allows the guerrillas to be based on its territory, denies it is fighting with them in the decade-old civil war. There was no independent confirmation of any of <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>'s reports. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also reported heavy clashes between supporters of rival guerrilla groups in <LOCATION> Tutum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dara </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Parwan </LOCATION> province north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He said there were `` a lot of casualties,'' but he gave no numbers. Among the groups involved was Hezb-e-islami and Jamiat-e-islami, he said. The two fundamentalist groups have reportedly been engaged in a power struggle recently. Guerrilla sources have said Hezb supporters ambushed Jamiat forces on July 9 in the north and killed 30 of their fighters. The reported battles between the groups has raised new questions about the ability of the guerrillas to overthrow the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Moslem leaders and their supporters demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Good Offices Mission. `` American imperialists, die!'' they shouted while a small group of protesters shook and banged the metal gates at the entrance to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office was established to help oversee the Soviet withdrawal. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials are also supposed to help the governments of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> cut off arms supplies to both sides of the war. Since June 25, more than 280 people have been killed and 745 injured in the rocket attacks and a car bombing in the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> area.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s top <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> introduced legislation Wednesday to restore the $ 23,000-a-year pension former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> lost because of his felony convictions in the Iran-Contra affair. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., said <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a 20-year Marine veteran, has `` demonstrated his willingness to give his life for his country'' and should not be asked `` to give up the security of his own family on charges that may not have been his doing. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>'s legislation would exempt North from a law that denies retirement pay to any government officer convicted of destroying government documents, one of three felony crimes for which <PERSON> North </PERSON> was convicted. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> on Monday rejected a recommendation from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s pension be restored, saying there is `` serious doubt'' about whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> was entitled to retirement pay. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> suspended <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s pension when he was sentenced July 5 for his convictions on charges of aiding and abetting an obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, accepting an illegal gratuity and altering or destroying classified documents. He was fined $ 150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recommended that <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> restore <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s pension after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s judge advocate general concluded that <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a retiree should not be considered an officeholder under the terms of the law. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel had reached the opposite conclusion. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinchman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recommendation for <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, said it was `` impossible to avoid the conclusion that there is serious doubt that a retired regular officer'' convicted of destroying documents can continue to receive retirement pay. <PERSON> Hinchman </PERSON> said the denial of retirement pay to <PERSON> North </PERSON> gives him the right to file suit and seek a definitive ruling on whether the law applies to him. Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, offered an amendment to the fiscal 1990 defense bill Wednesday to restore <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s pension. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted a modified proposal from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to study the issue and report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by November.

 <PERSON> Yamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, a younger brother of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, grinned a toothless smile in the cell he shares with 23 other convicts in notorious Evin prison and said, `` Things could be worse.'' Speaking in broken English to a group of foreign reporters on a conducted tour of the prison in north <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, he said he was serving a 10-year sentence `` for a family reason,'' but refused to be more specific. He said he had seven more years to serve. <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, wearing a white T-shirt and gray pajama trousers, lay sprawled on blankets spread on the cell floor. There were no beds or any other furniture. Prison officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the prisoner had been disowned as a drug addict by <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> before the February 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the monarchy. The shah fled <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a month earlier, with other family members. He underwent medical treatment for cancer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, then went to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and on to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> where he died in July 1980. The officials said <PERSON> Yamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> was arrested as a vagrant and imprisoned three years ago. `` We are well-treated here,'' <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, 58, said, adding that he was kept busy `` gardening and looking after roses.'' Other inmates in his cell included a former general and senior officials of the <PERSON> shah </PERSON>'s regime who refused to give their names. Meeting the <PERSON> shah </PERSON>'s brother was the highlight of Sunday's conducted tour arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> In a bizarre incident, a Danish reporter was attacked by a prison guard while the group was inspecting a block of empty cells. `` I was walking down a corridor when suddenly this man started shouting in <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> and then pushed me into a cell and started beating me up,'' said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyndorff </PERSON>, a correspondent for the Danish newspaper <LOCATION> Jyllands-Posten </LOCATION>. Later, the guard, a bearded, middle-age man who refused to give his name, started shouting that all the reporters on the tour were <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents. The guard later apologized and said he pushed <PERSON> Lyndorff </PERSON> into a cell because the reporter had refused to identify himself as part of the group. The mostly Western journalists were among a limited number allowed into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the July 28 presidential elections. The reporters were shown one of a dozen empty blocks of cells in the sprawling jail that held thousands of political prisoners in the Islamic revolution's early days. Prison officials said the block was vacated after an amnesty declared in February during celebrations of the revolution's 10th anniversary. Hundreds of `` enemies of the revolution'' reportedly were executed in the prison, set on a steep mountain slope in fashionable north <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, across a narrow wooded valley from a leading hotel, the Grand Azadi. The reporters were shown another block containing 12 large cells, about 12 by 9 yards, each with 24 inmates. Each had a television set but no furniture. The prisoners sprawled on blankets, reading newspapers. Officials escorting the journalists refused to say how many prisoners were in the jail. Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> said earlier at a news conference that the only political prisoners left in <LOCATION> Evin </LOCATION> were those serving life sentences for capital crimes. <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> said most prisoners now were drug addicts or narcotics peddlers jailed during an anti-drug crackdown launched by the government in January. The reporters also were shown the prison workshop, where inmates were making military uniforms and shoes. The Guidance Ministry provided interpreters so reporters could converse with the prisoners. A few inmates spoke English. All those interviewed said they were jailed for political offenses. One prisoner who gave his name as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Aragi </PERSON> said he was a member of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s outlawed Tudeh Communist party. He said a revolutionary court sentenced him to death on charges of spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment under another amnesty declared by the late revolutionary patriarch, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aragi </PERSON>, 56, said he also spent time in jail during the shah's time for belonging to <LOCATION> Tudeh </LOCATION> but conditions were better under the Islamic regime `` Things were far worse in the days of the shah. Prison guards used to beat us all the time. Now we're well-treated and there are no beatings,'' he said, speaking in <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> through an interpreter.

<HEAD>Strike Law Calls for Binding Arbitration</HEAD>
<UNK>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the government-controlled unions presented a draft labor law to the legislature Wednesday, saying Soviet workers should be allowed to strike if binding arbitration fails, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalayev </PERSON> presented the law just days before the Supreme Soviet is to adjourn for the summer and a couple of weeks after strikes by hundreds of thousands of miners paralyzed much of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s coal industry. The Supreme Soviet debate over the proposed law so soon after the strikes indicated that the government views labor unrest as a potentially serious problem for President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his reform effort. But a leader of one Siberian coal strike committee said strikers view <PERSON> Shalayev </PERSON> and other national union officials as `` just another echelon of power,'' and that more strikes are likely unless the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s social and economic situation turns around. Soviet law in principle allows workers to strike but never has addressed the issue explicitly. Workers are walking off their jobs to protest low pay and bad working conditions as well as unwillingness of the official union leadership to help. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shalayev </PERSON> told the Supreme Soviet the law calls for establishing conciliation commissions to settle labor disputes and gives either side the right to appeal to an arbitration commission set up by a local court. It appeared from the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report that the law calls for permitting strikes only when management fails to live up to an agreement or arbitration order. The arbitration panel decision `` will be obligatory for fulfillment,'' the official news agency said. `` If the conflicting parties still fail to settle their differences, a labor collective will be given the right to use all other methods envisaged by the law, including a strike,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> added. `` However, this can be done on the decision of the majority of the labor collective.'' The law also prohibits strikes that endanger people's lives, or disrupt the normal life of the people or defense industries, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It provided no details on what would be included in those categories, but if interpreted broadly they could prohibit nearly all strikes. Workers engaged in a legal strike will receive part of their regular pay from management, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Shalayev </PERSON> acknowledged under questioning in the Supreme Soviet that the draft law needs amendments. But the legislature endorsed it in general and set it for publication in the official press. A legislative debate will take place in the fall. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said many Supreme Soviet deputies spoke out for expanding the right to strike and sharply defining those industries in which strikes are not allowed. Emphasizing workers' suspicion of the official unions, one of the coal strike leaders wrote in Wednesday's edition of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News that the strikers regarded the unions as `` one more upper echelon of power, from which we are given orders.'' <PERSON> Teimuraz </PERSON> <PERSON> Avaliani </PERSON>, a member of the parliament and chairman of the strike committee in the <LOCATION> Kemerovo </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, said: `` We need to create unions that are fundamentally new, maybe, alternative unions.'' `` It simply did n't enter our minds to invite <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalayev </PERSON> to our side, and we presented him with demands similar to other representatives of authority,'' <PERSON> Avaliani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Avaliani </PERSON> said the strike was not an effort to take something away from somebody else, but `` the action of people who live worse than anyone else.''

 An advertising agency Wednesday dumped hotel queen <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s $ 5 million-a-year account and depicted itself as the latest victim of her imperious attitude and penny pinching. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> had a penchant for intruding in the ads and sealed her fate with <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Aarons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc. when she imposed an arbitrary 60 percent cut in agency fees for May and June, three company executives said `` I've been reading the papers. This is part of the pattern. She's squeezed other contractors,'' said agency president <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON>. `` Eventually, no one escapes.'' The company had handled the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> account on a verbal agreement for three years. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was informed of the decision in a letter sent to her home. The harsh words were the latest directed at Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who was in federal court Wednesday for her tax evasion trial. Witnesses have detailed her abrasiveness and hair-trigger temper. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called her `` the wicked witch.'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON>, who said her company stands to lose $ 500,000 a year from its decision, pulled no punches herself. `` All of us knew she was queen and we were there to serve her,'' she said. `` It was evident in her body language, her imperiousness and her arrogance.'' She also described a typical business meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>: `` She was drinking martinis, and I was drinking <PERSON> Brioschi </PERSON>. There was a lot of tension. ... She told me, ` Do n't get comfortable. You're not here for a social event.''' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, approached by reporters at the courthouse about the agency's decision, said nothing and zipped shut her lips. <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON> was not the first agency to use Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> in ads for the hotel chain, or to dub her the `` queen'' _ her nickname among agency employees. In fact, she plays a smaller role in the agency's ads, which emphasize the luxury of the accommodations. Still, the tag line remains: the <LOCATION> Helmsley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, the ads say, is the only palace where the queen stands guard. And the ads worked: Occupancy jumped from 24 percent before the ads to 87 percent after. Nevertheless, the ads were recently critiqued in <ORGANIZATION> Adweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> as ranking `` among the worst advertising of our time ... terrible, conceptually unoriginal, poorly written, badly art-directed and photographically ugly.'' Agency officials said Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was deeply involved in their ad campaigns. `` She'd say, ` I do n't like the way that lapel looks. I do n't like the way that button looks. And it was n't a question,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON>, the agency's creative director. `` It was ` Move that button. Lift that bale. Tote that barge.''' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON> cited a recent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state advertising awards competition in which the Helmsley ads were nominated. `` There was such an uproar from certain judges that it was decided not to consider us for the award,'' she said. `` It was the client, not the ads.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON> predicted Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> would have no trouble finding another ad agency. `` And we'll send them all our Maalox, Advil and extra suits of armor.''

<HEAD>Homeless Looking Out for Themselves as Spiked Wine Threat Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Homeless people have formed a `` neighborhood watch'' to protect themselves from the threat posed by wine bottles spiked with glass shards that someone has been leaving around town. Thirty-two spiked bottles have been found in the last month at various places where the homeless are known to go. No one has been hurt, police said Wednesday. `` People in suburban neighborhoods have these neighborhood watches because they're worried about crime. ... Well, homeless people are victims of crimes too,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, who camps near downtown, said. `` Somebody may take a belt of this wine and get hurt real bad. So some of us are walking the streets every night and keeping our eyes open.'' He said the homeless are not the only ones in danger. A group of children recently found six bottles in a park. Some advocates for the homeless contend that the police did not respond quickly enough. `` If this had been a case of adulterated food in grocery stores, you would have had a serious response immediately,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggstrom </PERSON>, coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. Police say they are aggressively investigating and have assigned a detective to the case full-time. Although police did not begin posting flyers warning the homeless until July 20, the department issued a press release July 1, after the first bottle was found. `` We're finding these bottles in a relatively large geographical area, so it's not an easy case,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaus </PERSON> said. `` And it's not like food tampering inside a store where you can track down manufacturing and distribution methods. With the wine bottles, it appears as if the glass has been put inside the bottles after they were purchased.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders rallied Wednesday around their landslide nominee to succeed the late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, while two Democrats began a tense runoff campaign. The winner in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary Tuesday, state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, was born in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, a significant factor in a city where politics, often is influenced by tensions among whites, blacks and mostly Cuban-born Hispanics. Many look to the special vote to fill the 18th District seat as a chance to elect the first Cuban-born member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. On the Democratic side, attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> claimed he had momentum and his opponent, former <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, was suffering backlash from negative campaigning as they headed to an Aug. 15 runoff. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> finished 146 votes ahead of Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in Tuesday's primary, with <ORGANIZATION> Pepper </ORGANIZATION>'s niece, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, third in the seven-candidate field Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s supporters said nominating another Cuban-born woman to oppose Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> would negate ethnic factors. But <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> called the 18th District `` an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> seat'' and said he could unite the multi-ethnic community. Pepper, a liberal champion of the elderly and poor who held the seat for the Democrats since 1962, died May 30 at age 88. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, who won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination with 83 percent of the vote, welcomed <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> help campaigning for the Aug. 29 special election. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> headlined a luncheon Wednesday to benefit her and other state Republican candidates. Republicans are hoping to add to their unprecedented 10-8 majority in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation. `` We're going to go all out,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>. `` We have the better candidate and we're unified. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president's son, was at her victory party Tuesday night, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., telephoned congratulations `` I'm particularly grateful that the primary campaign was one that did not open wounds among Republicans,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the bloody fight is going to be between the Democrats.

She's married to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, 48, and Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 44, were already arguing early Wednesday over whose campaign was ethnically divisive. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> took Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to task for agreeing with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s remark that it was time to elect a Cuban-American to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

I am a Cuban-American. I'm also a woman.

The tickets apparently fell to the ground when he left the car, <PERSON> Goss </PERSON> said. `` I felt real mad, real aggravated because I knew it was all because of a practical joke,'' <PERSON> Goss </PERSON> said. In response to a classified advertisement he placed in the <ORGANIZATION> Morgantown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, an elderly couple returned the tickets on Sunday. They refused to tell their names, but accepted a reward. Given a choice of four tickets or $ 200, they chose the money.

 It's not easy getting into the Guinness Book of World Records, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> fraternity found out. Sigma Alpha Epsilon members hoped the 350-gallon milkshake they whipped up in February would earn them a spot in the record book's next edition Instead, a 1,500-gallon chocolate milkshake made by the <ORGANIZATION> WEZN </ORGANIZATION> radio station of <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> the previous fall at a festival in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> took the record. `` Well, it looks as though we're not going to try and beat that record this fall at <ORGANIZATION> UConn </ORGANIZATION>,'' said fraternity President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannheim </PERSON>. He said the fraternity made a crack at the record when it found out in February that the Guinness editors had not made a decision on the WEZN entry. `` We had decided before we began, whether it was a Guinness Book record or not, we were going to do it,'' <PERSON> Dannheim </PERSON> said. `` We had a lot of fun doing it.'' The radio station's giant milkshake was mixed at a Baskin-Robbins plant for the annual `` Taste of New Haven'' festival. The mixture was then pumped into a dairy truck, station spokeswoman <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVigne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> editor, said some editors at the record book had a problem with the mixing method, which delayed a final decision. `` It will just become a competition of who has the bigger truck,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` One thousand, five hundred gallons is it. It's enough.'' A Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, also was planning to go for the record, and was disappointed to learn of the New Haven entry. `` When we found out, we were back to the same old routine,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Repczynski </PERSON>, the chapter's treasurer. `` We'll be relegated to chugging goldfish again.''

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Wednesday called for an emergency <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> summit to find a solution to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s war after a committee appointed to do so declared itself at an impasse. Eight people were wounded in the latest Syrian-Christian fighting. Police said occasional bursts of machine-gun fire and mortar explosions echoed on both sides of the Green Line, which divides the capital into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors. The skirmishes were much lighter than confrontations have been in the past week and coincided with the Moslem new year, an official holiday throughout <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Government offices, banks and other businesses closed in Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors to mark the day, but there was little revelry. `` There is no celebration mood,'' said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Anouti </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem clergyman. `` <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been largely demolished and hundreds of innocent people have been killed. Do you expect anyone to celebrate anything?'' According to police figures, 511 people have died and 2,170 have been wounded in the latest round of fighting, which broke out March 8 between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian troops and Syrian soldiers and their Moslem allies. Many city streets have been reduced to rubble, and hundreds of thousands of residents have fled. A three-member <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ministerial committee, trying more than two months to solve <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s crisis, said Tuesday it reached an impasse and blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which keeps about 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate. During an Arab League summit in May, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON> were asked to find a settlement by November to the war. At the summit, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> blocked proposals to replace its troops with a pan-Arab force. The leftist daily newspaper As-Safir, which is close to the Syrian government of President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, described the committee's report as `` very serious because it reflected a hostile attitude toward <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Farouq </PERSON> <PERSON> Abillama </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, described the committee's report as an `` indictment of the Syrian presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, has declared a `` war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said they undermined their peacekeeping mandate by fighting on the Moslem side. Iraqi Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tareq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that an urgent session of the Arab summit was necessary to solve the crisis. `` An emergency Arab summit bears the responsibility of dealing with the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and saving this <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country from occupation, terrorism, and blackmail,'' said <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, who is also deputy prime minister. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe and considers <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> within its sphere of influence. It has refused to lift a blockade on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian enclave until it receives assurances <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has stopped sending arms to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> called for a collective Arab stand against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and said the Arabs should identify <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> as `` a major cause behind <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civl war.

 A federal jury today found <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> acted with willful misconduct when one of its planes flew off course six years ago and was shot down by a Soviet war plane, killing all 269 people aboard. The jury of three men and three women ruled that the actions by <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>'s crew were one of the causes of the shootdown of Flight 007 by a Soviet fighter plane. Today's verdict permits the families of the dead passengers to file individual suits seeking damages in excess of a $ 75,000-per-passenger limit on compensation set under international treaty. After the ruling read in court by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the jury began deliberating the question of whether the families are entitled to punitive damages as well and if so, in what amount. In final arguments Tuesday after a two-week trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, lawyers for families of the victims said Flight 007 was off course almost from the minute it left the ground in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and headed to its <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> route for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Two pilots, testifying as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs, theorized that the crew misprogrammed at least one and possibly all three on-board computerized navigation systems while the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said the main evidence in the case was a line drawn by Soviet officials on a map showing an off-course Flight 007 flying for several hours over <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> airspace hundreds of miles to the west of its planned route. `` That Russian line ... was furnished by the people who shot this plane down and killed these people,'' <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said. `` This disaster ... is going to remain a mystery until the Russians come forward and say what evidence they have to support that black line.'' <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said that to suggest the plane was off course for four hours means that the crew radioed in false position reports at three checkpoints in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Lawyers for the families sought to prove that crew members had to have known they were off course, yet decided to continue the flight rather than return to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, where they would have faced disciplinary action. The jury's verdict `` was in accord with all the evidence,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Madole </PERSON>, a lawyer for the families. `` When this plane was flown off course into the danger area ... it was in fact willful misconduct.'' <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said the company will appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` I think as a matter of law willful misconduct was not shown by the evidence,'' said <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>. A defense motion to set aside the case is pending before the judge.

 Leaders of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and local royalty welcomed the 15-year-old future ruler of this tiny oil-rich nation into the adult world Wednesday by sprinkling scented water on his hands. Cannons fired in salute and thousands of Bruneians watched on TV to watch the ritual for Prince <PERSON> Al-Muhtadee </PERSON> <PERSON> Billah </PERSON>, the son of Sultan <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkia </PERSON>. Leaders from <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, as well as 3,000 other VIPs, including members of the royal family, government dignitaries and foreign diplomats, were invited to the two-hour ceremony in the throne hall of the sultan's 1,778-room palace The pomp and pageantry, a combination of Islamic ritual and Malay culture, were actually a commemoration of Prince <PERSON> Billah </PERSON>'s circumcision, a momentous event in the life of Malay Moslems Even though the prince, eldest son of the 43-year-old sultan, was circumcised a few years ago, the ceremonies were dubbed `` berkhatan'' _ Malay for circumcision. `` Coming of age is a more appropriate term,'' an official said, but tradition dictates that such ceremonies be called berkhatan. A weeklong festival for the occasion began Sunday with the beating of gongs and playing of pipes and other ethnic musical instruments at the main gate to the 300-acre palace grounds. The streets of the capital were decorated with multicolored lights and yellow <LOCATION> Bruneian </LOCATION> flags fluttering from the top of virtually every building. Until Wednesday, however, the ceremonies had consisted of solemn prayers, chants of religious hymns and nightly poetry readings at the palace. A few hours before Wednesday's rites, the sultan, cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> as the world's wealthiest man, threw an elaborate dinner at the cavernous royal banquet hall, whose arches are covered with 22-carat gold tiles. His guest list was headed by President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and Prime Ministers <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. In declaring the sultan the world's richest individual, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said that as its absolute ruler, he has <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>'s oil income and foreign exchange reserves of about $ 30 billion `` effectively at his disposal.'' After all guests were seated, about 100 men and boys marched up the middle of the hall, bearing Prince <PERSON> Billah </PERSON>'s regalia. They included spears, swords, shields, rifles, pennants, candles, drums, brass vases and urns. Behind them walked the young prince, in a green costume gleaming with gold embroidery. Light from 12 giant chandeliers _ each with 600 bulbs _ reflected off the gems on his headdress. The normally shy boy appeared nervous. Just before Moslem priests began chanting praise to Allah, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Billah </PERSON> rose from his cushioned throne-like chair, set under a gold-colored canopy. Apparently realizing the miscue, he quickly sat back, his head bowed slightly. As the chanting began, the boy's parents, the leaders and other guests came forward one by one and sprinkled scented water on his hands, resting on a cushion on his lap. Outside, cannons boomed. Prince <PERSON> Billah </PERSON> is the third of the sultan's six children by <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleha </PERSON>, his first wife, but the elder of two boys. The sultan has a son and two daughters by his second wife, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>. On Thursday, the prince will undergo a cleansing ceremony in the privacy of his apartments. Officials say the equivalent of this rite for commoners is a swim in a river. After that, 25,000 children and other residents are expected to line the streets of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Seri </PERSON> <PERSON> Begawan </PERSON> to cheer <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Billah </PERSON> as he rides past on a float. Ceremonies at the palace are to continue through Sunday.

<HEAD>Drugs Promising For Transplanted Organs, Says Researcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An experimental drug that stimulates rather than suppresses the immune system offers new hope in preventing rejection of transplanted human organs, a researcher says. `` The central dogma has been that if you stimulate the immune system, that's bad,'' Dr. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immunology </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. `` We're developing a new dogma that says it's possible to use the immune system as an ally.'' Results of his research, which includes successful testing in rodents, were delivered Wednesday to delegates to the triennial <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Immunology in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> is testing lectins, proteins derived from plant tissue. He said lectins promote the growth of certain white blood cells called T-supressors. While the action of the T-supressors is not clear, they apparently restrain another type of white blood cell, T-killers, that attack foreign tissue, including transplanted organs. In experiments at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, transplanted hearts in rats remained free of rejection for more than two years with no side effects. The rats received 50 days of lectin treatment, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said in the telephone interview, before his <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> speech. Tests on humans are still years away, he said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the lectins and two other experimental drugs will require extensive further testing, but may someday reduce the need for large doses of cyclosporine, a potent drug now used to prevent transplant rejection by depressing the immune system. `` If our initial hopes are proven, we are nearing a fundamental turning point in being able to keep transplant patients healthier and alive longer,'' he said. Since human organ transplants began with kidneys about 35 years ago, doctors have been unable to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs without compromising the immune system. Cyclosporine, derived from a soil fungus, helps prevent rejection by restraining the formation of white blood cells that attack transplanted organs. But the daily oral doses can lead to kidney failure and high blood pressure. Two other transplant experts _ Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> and Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Corry </PERSON>, chairman of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION> _ said the use of lectins is virtually untested elsewhere. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' idea of boosting the immune system to prevent organ rejection is a departure from current thinking on the problem. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said tests at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> found lectins and two other drugs, FK-506 and RPM, were effective in preventing rejection of transplanted hearts in rodents. Like cyclosporine, he said, FK-506 and RPM are derived from fungus and work by depressing the immune system, but they are more powerful. FK-506, developed several years ago by a Japanese company, was nearly 20 times more potent than cyclosporine in rodent testing, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. Heart transplants in rats treated for two weeks with FK-506 survived eight times longer, some longer than a year, than recipients treated with cyclosporine, even though the FK-506 dose was only one-fifth that of cyclosporine, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said his testing of FK-506 indicated that while it may be powerful, it was too early to predict its potential. <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> said the hope is that FK-506 would be less toxic but more effective than cyclosporin.

<HEAD>Truckers Say Refrigerated Food Trucks Also Carry Garbage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Truckers testifying behind a screen to conceal their identities told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday that they carried garbage in the same refrigerated trucks used for food hauls, a legal practice a lawmaker called `` more than disgusting.'' `` Would you serve potato salad from your cat's litter box?'' <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> food science professor <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroger </PERSON> rhetorically asked a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee during an all-day hearing. The investigations subcommittee released correspondence showing that <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Geo </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hormel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and other food manufacturers had taken steps in the last two months to ensure that their products were not placed in the same trailers that hauled waste to landfills. None of the food firms said it knew of such a practice, but all said they wanted to safeguard against it. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said an investigation had found no contaminated food. The vice president and driver for a small, family-owned trucking firm specializing in hauling meat products from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to the East told the subcommittee food-garbage hauling appeared widespread. `` Of the ten largest carriers in my area that haul refrigerated food products to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, six of them I know have loaded it -LRB- garbage -RRB-,'' he said. A woman trucker told the panel her firm hauled two loads of garbage on return trips by food trucks to the Midwest. She said she refused other loads because `` I just did n't want to put it in the trucks.'' Both truckers who testified were hidden by a partition on three sides because they did not want their identities made public, according to the committee, which also would not divulge their home states. Part of the problem is that trucks making trips East can not afford to return to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> empty, the male trucker said. He said garbage is `` a dream commodity'' to return home with because `` you're not responsible for anything. How could you destroy it?'' Still, he said he felt there could be sanitary problems, even though his trucks are steam-cleaned. `` I'm not a bacteriologist,'' he said. He said his meat-hauling trucks used to carry bales of waste to a landfill near <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but stopped in June at the request of customers. The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in an inquiry last month confirmed the practice of food trucks carrying garbage, according to testimony. In one instance, a food truck emptied at an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> landfill `` emanated powerful garbage odors'' despite just being washed, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaillard </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance. Before the garbage haul, the truck had carried avocadoes from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gaillard </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON>, R-Pa., organized the hearing after a <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reporter in his district observed trailers and refrigerator trucks in May either carrying or being loaded with municipal solid waste at a transfer station, and being unloaded at an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> landfill `` The idea of garbage being hauled in food trucks seems more than disgusting,'' <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It seems dangerous.'' He said a new law was needed because existing regulations are ambiguous. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, said in a written statement that, `` It would seem appropriate to <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> to require that trailers be properly cleaned _ by steam or other effective process _ before they leave a landfill site.'' Refrigerator trailers, with their ribbed, stainless-steel floors, normally carry meat, poultry, dairy products, fresh fruits and vegetables to market. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said there were chemical and microbiological arguments against food-garbage hauling. `` Food trucks that back up into filthy dump sites presumably can easily be infected all over and later spread disease-causing bacteria into the truck bodies and into food factories during loading,'' he said.

 Doctors are amazed at the quick recovery of a 73-year-old American nun who was seriously wounded when she was shot in the head during an apparent robbery attempt in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> six weeks ago. Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanislaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, a member of the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, will be moved to a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> convent this week to continue her recuperation, doctors at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` I think the outcome approaches miracle stage when one considers she was shot in the head at close range with a large-caliber handgun,'' <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>, the nun's neurosurgeon, said. ` Sister <PERSON> Stan </PERSON>,' as she is called, was hit by a .38 - caliber bullet June 21 as she and two other nuns rode in a pickup truck in <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> The sisters are unsure of the motive for the attack, but speculate the gunman, one of several men in a pickup truck, wanted to rob the nuns, who had just been to a bank. Sister <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> worked in the town 10 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in an orphanage for children whose parents have been killed in the nine-year civil war between leftist guerrillas and the government. The bullet shattered her cheekbone. After initial treatment in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, she was flown to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where her religious order is based. Doctors operated June 26 to remove a bullet fragment lodged in her brain and to relieve swelling in her brain. A second operation was performed July 8 to reattach the retina in her left eye. `` There appears to have been some damage to her optic nerve and we're not sure how much sight she will recover in her left eye,'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Sister <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, accompanied by a nurse and using a cane for support, read a brief prepared statement at a news conference Tuesday but declined to take questions. `` I want to thank everyone for their interest and their prayers,'' she said. `` God has taken me completely into His hands, and I thank everybody who has played a part in my recovery. I especially appreciate the good work of my doctors, the nurses, priests, bishops and the sisters of the congregation.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he anticipated no long-term problems with motor functions although she had some problems with short-term memory. Five or six men accused of the shooting were taken into custody within the past week, said Sister <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON>, one of the other nuns in the pickup truck, but she has been unable to identify them for police. Sister <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, a registered nurse, had worked in Central America since 1963 and in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since 1983.

<HEAD>Dryness in Some Regions Continues Pattern of the Decade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It may surprise some soggy Easterners, but drought _ the big 1988 weather story now getting little national attention _ is still a hot item in parts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. True, the East and South which baked a year ago are now stuck in a summer of excessive wetness. But the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, relatively moist in the summer of 1988, is parched this year. And parts of the Corn Belt in the nation's middle, as well as sections of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, have been dry in both summers. The Western and Midwestern dryness this summer continues a pattern of the decade, which have seen serious regional drought somewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> every year except 1982. More than half of the nation is undergoing either severely dry or excessively wet conditions, an indication that the upper air flow patterns are allowing conditions to remain in place for long periods, federal climate researchers report. The 30-day outlook for August contains some hope for the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, although the heavier than normal rainfall expected this month is n't likely to continue over the upcoming 90 days, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reports. As for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, dryer than normal conditions are forecast in August with the outlook mixed over the three-month span. Even so it is n't as bad as last summer, one of the driest years overall in this century. In June, for example, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey found 27 percent of the nation's streams and rivers running below normal. In June 1988, some 60 percent of rivers and streams were below normal. A compromise disaster-relief proposal seems near in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seek to help farmers cope with the crop-wilting weather in some areas and drowned fields in other regions. From May 1 to mid-July less than half of the normal rain fell in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and along the eastern edge of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The excessive heat and dryness in the West has contributed to the extreme fire danger in many areas, with dangerous blazes raging in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other regions. In the Midwestern farm belt, crops are suffering not only by lack of rain this year but with lack of soil moisture due to last year's drought. Corn, soybean and grain crops are affected, among others. Some recent rains have helped the topsoil, but so far have been too light to improve moisture conditions below the surface. `` Since May 1, below normal rainfall has persisted from southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> northeastward to the upper Plains and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. In extreme southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, deficits exceed 10 inches,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reports. June, normally the wettest month in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, saw only 60 percent of normal rainfall in parts of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> has had to release impounded water to maintain navigation on parts of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and sections of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> are carrying only about one-third of the usual flow for this time of year. Meantime, the Southeast was drenched with rains spawned by tropical storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> in late June and early July, the wetness extending as far as the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> states.

<HEAD>Official: Communists Could Enact Own Multiparty Law Without Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior communist official indicated Wednesday that his party could enact its own legislation on political reform if talks founder with the opposition, but a communist negotiator urged patience. The comment by Deputy Justice Minister <PERSON> Geza </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> came hours after members of the opposition accused the ruling communists of dragging their feet in negotiations that broke down last week. The negotiations broke down over the wording of a new constitution, a new party law, party finances and the office of a new president with wide powers. The first multiparty elections in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since the 1948 communist takeover are slated to be held next year. <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> indicated legislative measures already drawn up by the communists, but tabled for review in talks with the opposition, could be considered in Parliament without discussion if the negotiations remain inconclusive. `` If there is no suitable progress made, we will simply take those items of draft legislation and put them back on the table again in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> criticized the Opposition Round Table, which includes nine opposition groups, for what he called their inflexibility. But <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Gyerogy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON>, a leading communist negotiator, said he still seeks an agreement. `` It does not help the achievement of a compromise if differing views are made public too early,'' <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON> said. `` Compromise requires an atmosphere of patience and calm.'' <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a top reformer on the Executive Political Committee -LRB- Politburo -RRB-, has promised an agreement regardless of how long it takes. At an earlier news conference, <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kis </PERSON> of the League of Free Democrats alleged the Hungarian Socialist Workers -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party `` is trying to suggest to the nation that the choice is between that party and chaos.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Toelgyessy </PERSON> of the League of Free Democrats said the communists want to retain in the constitution the paragraph on the working class as the leading social force in the nation `` and other such holdovers from the present constitution based on the Stalinist model.'' He said the communists want `` to use the constitutional state as a smokescreen and continue business as usual under the same management.'' The opposition groups disagree on the need to have a law on parties, contending that the existing law on association is sufficient and only a law on party financing and operation is needed. A major obstacle in the talks is whether the wealth of the communist party should be distributed to other groups. On July 27, the communists, who had been amenable to discussing the issue, reversed their position. They said the party acquired its assets legally and that distribution of the money is an internal party affair. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON> sidestepped a question on his party's financial holdings There is also disagreement on who may field candidates in first multi-party elections next year and how many signatures will be required to get on the ballot and where and how such signatures may be collected.

 Orders for manufactured goods edged up a slight 0.4 percent in June, reflecting a rebound in demand for military hardware, the government said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new orders for manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 234.6 billion in June following a sharp 2.6 percent plunge in May. Many analysts said they were unimpressed by the slight rebound in June, pointing out that the big drop in May was the third setback so far this year. They also noted a report Tuesday that the Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of economic conditions, fell in July to its lowest point in 6 -LCB- years. `` The industrial sector is losing ground,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are seeing a mild recession developing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> right now.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> predicted that the economy would contract in both the current quarter and in the fourth quarter of this year before beginning to recover in early 1990. However, other economists were not as pessimistic, noting that the housing industry, which had been in a slump earlier this year, is beginning to rebound. Another government report Wednesday showed that new homes sales climbed 5.5 percent in June, the third monthly increase. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said the pickup in housing should spill over into manufacturing, helping to bolster sales of home appliances and building materials. Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> and other economists said one reason they believed the country would be able to escape a recession is that unsold inventories have not built up to such high levels that they would trigger sharp cutbacks in production over the months ahead. Those economists also noted that the backlog of unfilled orders, considered a good indicator of whether production cutbacks will be needed, continued to rise in June, climbing by 0.5 percent to $ 490.3 billion. The orders backlog has not declined since February 1987. In June, new orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, rose 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 124.2 billion. This represented a slight upward revision from an advance report a week ago that put the increase at 0.3 percent. Orders for nondurable goods rose 0.4 percent as well, with various consumer categories showing strength. Much of June's overall advance came from an 18.3 percent surge in orders for military equipment, a rebound from an 11.4 percent drop in this volatile category in May. Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods edged up 0.3 percent in June following a 7.7 percent decline in May. This category is closely watched for signs of industry plans to expand and modernize. Many economists said they believed that business investment, which has been strong over the past year, will weaken in the last half of 1989. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is counting on continued strength in investment to support its optimistic forecast that the overall economy will grow by 2.9 percent, as measured by the gross national product. Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.5 percent in June to $ 231.9 billion. The trend in shipments has been flat this year, averaging $ 231.2 billion, about 1.5 percent less than orders each month.

 The flagship of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 6th Fleet canceled a ceremonial visit to a Soviet port, and it and other warships were put `` at the beck and call'' of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday in case they're needed in the hostage situation, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and eight escort ships also cut short a port call in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, other officials said, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> refused to reveal the carrier's destination or the reason for the battle group's early departure. Military officials, speaking privately, emphasized that the ship movements were not `` bellicose'' actions and noted that the forces in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> area remain at the normal peace-time level. But the announcements highlighted the type of `` show-the-flag'' movements designed to give the impression that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces are ready to act if the president decides to use them. `` We're positioning ourselves at the beck and call of the president,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official familiar with the tactics. `` These are not necessarily bellicose moves _ but we want to be ready in case we are needed. ... These are prudent measures,'' the official said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official stressed that `` extensive on-scene diplomatic efforts'' are under way, and that emphasis is not being placed on a possible military strike. `` We are just giving the president what he might need,'' the official said. But, the official also pointed out, in case a strike is ordered, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships are ready with their long-range guns, aircraft and missiles, even if they remain some distance from a possible target. `` You do n't have to be near the shore to do what may be necessary,'' the official said. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced that the USS Belknap, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flagship in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, canceled a four-day call at the port of <LOCATION> Sevastapol </LOCATION>. Two other ships, the USS <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kauffman </LOCATION>, were slated to keep to the scheduled visit, set for Aug. 4-8. The <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, a guided missile cruiser with fleet commander Vice Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> aboard, had been scheduled to call at the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port as part of a long-planned exchange worked out between the superpowers. Three Soviet ships just departed <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, after conducting the first such visit to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> port in 14 years. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and his ship `` are required elsewhere and will not be able to visit <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The statement made no mention of the reported execution of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, or of threats by Shiite Moslem factions to execute another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage. The cancellation of the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>'s visit allows <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to remain in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in case his services are needed there, said other officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier in the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, the USS Coral Sea, had left <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, `` several hours earlier'' than planned, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, following normal policy, refused to divulge the destination of any of the carriers or their battle groups. One official pointed out that if the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is headed in the direction of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, it will take nearly a week for the carrier to cross the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Overall, there are between 20 to 25 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> at this time, with approximately 20 others in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> region, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, which is not allowed to use its 16-inch guns pending the outcome of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into the April explosion in one of its three turrets, ended its port call in <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and is in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the sources said. The ship has a variety of weapons, including cruise missiles, that could be used if necessary, sources said. Also on permanent station in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> is a three-ship amphibious landing group composed of 2,400 Marines, officials said. `` This is very typical of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official. `` There is nothing unique about our deployment there. It's our normal peace-time position,'' he said. The official added that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s duty is to provide a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence around the world and the ship movements allow routine patrols as well as for training. `` We have to train as if we were at war, and you ca n't do that in port,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Although many Poles may find it unsavory to have a policeman heading the government, the election Wednesday of Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> as prime minister means very little change. Before the presidential election July 19, the three most important officials were Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, the interior minister. On Wednesday, after the government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> moves were completed, the three most important figures were <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. Now they have different job titles and roles, but the same team is in place for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to continue its contradictory policy of `` agreement and struggle'' with the reborn Solidarity trade union movement. The party needs agreement with the opposition to cure <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic problems But the party also needs to fight with the opposition for the hearts and minds of at least a part of the population. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the author of the policy who has resigned as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, assumed the newly strengthened office of president with ultimate control of the military and foreign relations. He is a guarantee to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist neighbors that moves toward democracy demanded by Solidarity wo n't bring any sudden change in the country's loyalty to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. He was <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s top leader before, and he retains that power now. In addition, he has prolonged his time in power. Party rules would have required him to step down as leader after the next party congress in 1990. Now, he can hold the office of president at least until 1995. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, whom Solidarity leaders would like to impeach for alleged mismanagement of the economy during his nine months as prime minister, moves over to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s old office at party headquarters. A strong-willed player of political hardball, he riled the opposition early in his administration with his decision to close Solidarity's birthplace, the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. He riled it again at the end of his term with spectacular increases in food prices. According to one <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member quoted during the party debate on <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s candidacy, public confidence in the government fell by half during his tenure. Now that Solidarity holds a good chunk of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> _ control of the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 35 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> _ the prime minister by necessity must be able to work with the union. Always more of a fighter than conciliator, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> did not fit the job description. In key ways, however, he does fit the needs of the party, its self-confidence and fighting spirit deflated as the result of its crushing losses to Solidarity in the June parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s most important trait is that he will get the party `` up off its knees,'' a party spokesman said this week. Enter <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. As interior minister since 1981 in charge of an army of uniformed and secret police, he knows the opposition better than anyone else in government. His agents tapped their telephones and collected their illegal publications. During two waves of strikes last year, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> opened channels of communication to the opposition and called for the talks that evolved into the historic `` round-table'' accords that legalized Solidarity and led to the country's first democratic elections since World War II. As head of the police, he had credibility with Solidarity as a negotiating partner and did not risk appearing too soft to his colleagues when he made concessions. In nominating <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> to head the government after <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> emphasized his proven ability at the round table to reach agreements. Speaking of his relationship with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last month, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> himself acknowledged the same. `` We differ in many respects and yet, so far, we have always managed to come to an agreement when matters of crucial agreement were concerned,'' he said. `` And this is what counts most.'' Although the job switches undoubtedly suit the current needs of <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, they are bound to disappoint many Poles who expected dramatic changes when they voted in 260 out of 261 Solidarity candidates during the parliamentary elections. In the end, the same people will be in charge. `` What kind of new government is that supposed to be?'' said a disgruntled lawmaker from the communist-allied <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>HHS Head Says Methadone Programs Not Perfect, But Helpful</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that while methadone programs are `` not ideal,'' they are better than doing nothing to help heroin addicts quit their habit and avoid AIDS. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, defended his department's proposal to make methadone available to more addicts to prevent needle-sharing and help curb the spread of AIDS. `` This is not ideal,'' he said in response to two studies critical of the plan. `` But this, we feel, is better than nothing for those individuals.'' He emphasized that the program proposed in March would be an `` interim step'' that would allow heroin addicts to receive methadone while they wait for an opening in a comprehensive methadone treatment program. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, in separate studies presented to the committee, questioned the wisdom of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' plan. They cited continued drug abuse by many patients in treatment and illegal diversion of the methadone. Under the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> proposal, heroin addicts unable to get into a comprehensive treatment program would be able to receive methadone daily at outpatient clinics and from mobile medical units. The synthetic narcotic would not be provided for take-home use and addicts would be counseled on avoiding AIDS. Heroin addicts often share needles and, in doing so, can spread or contract the AIDS virus. Methadone, which is used to help relieve an addict's craving for heroin and is less addictive, is taken by mouth, eliminating the risk from needles. About 100,000 people were undergoing methadone treatment last year; the government estimates there are about 500,000 heroin addicts nationwide. Preliminary results of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study of 15 methadone programs in five states indicate that as many as 47 percent of patients in treatment for more than six months at one clinic continued to use drugs. Forty percent of patients at another clinic used cocaine. `` Results of our work indicate that most clinics have not been able to deal effectively with the drug problems of many of their patients,'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikles </PERSON>, director of national and public health issues for the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in testimony submitted to the panel. `` It is unclear how effective the interim maintenance program would be in reducing the spread of AIDS,'' she said. `` <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> believes that additional information is needed before the program is allowed to be implemented nationwide.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reviewed methadone clinics serving more than 3,300 patients in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Most clinic officials <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigators interviewed did not support the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> plan allowing interim methadone maintenance programs, she said. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haislip </PERSON>, deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said an investigation conducted in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area between Aug. 21 and Sept. 16, 1988, found `` there is significant selling of take-home dosages of methadone.'' <PERSON> Haislip </PERSON> said many of the programs monitored by <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> have lax safeguards and `` routinely ignore'' test results that show patients are using other drugs rather than take taking their methadone. `` There is little incentive for individuals to become drug-free because their steady supply of methadone provides them with a constant source of illicit income with which to purchase other drugs, primarily cocaine,'' he said.

 The communist-led coalition overcame internal rifts Wednesday to elect <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s interior minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, as prime minister, securing the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s control of the government <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said his first priority would be to provide food to the nation, which was reeling from price increases of up to 300 percent that took effect Tuesday. Many store shelves were empty because consumers stocked up on supplies before the prices went up. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> has been head of the nation's powerful police force the past eight years and was a leading enforcer of the 1981 martial-law crackdown on the Solidarity trade union. Parliament elected him 237-173, with 10 abstentions. He needed 211 votes. The election completed a trio of changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s top echelons, which leave the same personalities in power but with different functions. Former party leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> was elected president last month. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> succeeded him as party chief, and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>. The party kept the top political jobs despite a humiliating defeat in June elections _ the country's most democratic in 40 years. `` A political monopoly of exercising power by one party must be discarded and destroyed. It does not serve the country,'' Solidarity floor leader <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> before the vote. `` ` We stand against this candidacy because no personnel reshuffle within the present political arrangements, dictated by the monopoly of a single party, can solve the country's problems.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> must form a new government and work with Solidarity lawmakers to rebuild the economy. `` The most urgent task today is the problem of feeding the nation and filling empty shelves,'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said on the evening news. `` As chief of the government, I will devote my whole effort to that.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s candidacy appeared threatened Tuesday, when some deputies of the Communist-allied <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> threatened to withdraw their support. Communist officials persuaded them to vote for <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. The communist coalition holds a 299-161 majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but the communists themselves hold only 173 seats. The Peasants and Democratic Parties hold the rest in the coalition. Solidarity lawmakers went into caucus after the vote to see which of their members had not cast ballots and possibly helped <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. Many Solidarity deputies boycotted the presidential vote rather than casting `` no'' votes, allowing <PERSON> Jaruzelzki </PERSON> to win by a slim margin. In his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> renewed a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> proposal to form a `` grand coalition'' in which Solidarity lawmakers would be offered some ministries. The opposition has said it will not join such a coalition. `` I will not give up efforts to attract ... the representatives of the opposition circles with a hope that in the future a grand coalition government will be possible,'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said. Communist leaders would like Solidarity to join the government to share in difficult decisions that must be made to reform the economy. But the party says it is not prepared to give the opposition the prime minister's job or key ministries such as defense and the interior. In a speech before the vote, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> called for `` drastic measures'' to prevent economic destabilization. Among his proposals were budget cuts, reevaluating investment policy and curbing some exports, including cattle. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said he hoped to form a government within two weeks. He then must tackle the economy. The value of the zloty is plunging daily. Shoppers emptied store shelves last week ahead of Tuesday's sharp price increases, and discontented workers throughout the country are grumbling that the time has come to strike. The price increases were part of a controversial `` marketization'' plan of <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>. Authorities said the increases are needed to prompt farmers to deliver their meat and produce to market and to stabilize the level of state subsidies to the food industry. Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lost a key vote for the first time in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as Solidarity lawmakers pushed through a resolution calling for an extraordinary investigation of the activities of the <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> government. Solidarity believes the government should be held accountable for the economic situation. The commission will decide if there are legal grounds to refer alleged misconduct to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, which handles government impeachments. The deputies voted 206-169 with 31 abstentions to create the commission. Neither <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was present for the vote. Officials Tuesday said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> went to the hospital after a spell of faintness in connection with a previously unpublicized heart and blood pressure problem. A secretary in his office Wednesday said he was feeling better and was no longer in the hospital.

 The international uproar over the reported killing of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, including criticism from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president-elect, left <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials somewhat encouraged Wednesday about the fate of the second American hostage facing a death sentence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Two days after a militant Shiite group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> announced <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' execution on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said she was unable to think of a single country that has n't spoken out against the action. Still, other officials cautioned the situation remains grim, pointing out the captors of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, who was taken hostage in 1986, have not backed off their pledge to execute him on Thursday. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> seemed to attach importance to a joint statement issued Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president-elect <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> in which they expressed regret over <PERSON> Higgin </PERSON>'s reported death. They also condemned `` all acts of a terrorist nature.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to act `` in accordance with the spirit'' of his statement. She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` remains convinced that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is in a position to bring significant influence to bear'' on the pro-Iranian groups who hold the American hostages and she called on the Iranians to use the influence. If <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' death is confirmed, that would leave eight American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was still unable to confirm absolutely that the body in the videotape released Monday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was that of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> also welcomed a statement by a top aide to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> criticizing the execution of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. The sense among American officials was that the outrage expressed by Western as well as Islamic countries about the developments in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> may be having an impact on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The officials, asking not to be identified, left open the possibility that the Iranians may have convinced the captors of <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 58, to delay his execution by 48 hours. A crisis atmosphere had prevailed here when the group claiming to hold <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said it would kill him Tuesday at 11 a.m. EDT unless <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> freed a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israeli commandos July 28. With the delay in administering the death sentence, officials expressed hope that intensified diplomatic efforts by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys may be bearing fruit. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats have been in touch with a number of countries with access to or influence with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem sources said Iranian pressure may have been behind the decision to delay the execution and added the chance his life may be spared has increased.

<HEAD>House Moves Toward Making Airline Smoking Ban Permanent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted tentatively on Wednesday to make the smoking ban on most airline flights permanent, but decided not to consider extending the prohibition to all routes. On a 259-169 vote, lawmakers adopted language that would make permanent the current ban on smoking on flights of two hours or less, which otherwise will expire next April. The ban covers 80 percent of domestic air traffic. But the provision, which was not actively opposed by the tobacco industry, also forbade consideration of a proposal to extend the ban to all domestic flights. The language became part of the $ 11.9 billion transportation appropriations bill for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. The House planned to complete work on the bill on Thursday and send it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., sponsor of the smoking ban proposal, cited surveys of airline passengers by health groups showing an overwhelming number of them support the two-hour ban <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopted in April 1988 `` I ca n't think of a thing we've done on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the last two years that has been greeted as positively and warmly by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he told his colleagues. <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, who sponsored the 1988 law, wanted to offer an amendment that would have banned smoking on all domestic flights. But he was blocked by the rules of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from offering it and was unable to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to change the procedure. The smoking ban provision was backed by airline employee and health organizations, which have argued that so-called secondary smoke breathed by people sitting next to smokers can be dangerous. The tobacco and cigarette industries and their supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ mostly from tobacco-growing states _ have argued that definitive data on the dangers of smoking is lacking, and that a prohibition hurts growers and manufacturers. However, lobbyists laid low during Wednesday's vote. They conceded that anti-smoking sentiment in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had reached the point where they were better off accepting a permanent ban on two-hour flights and avoiding fights on broadening the prohibition every time the law expires. `` We're not going to support this, but that does n't mean we're actively opposing it, either,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said before the vote `` This is no worse than what we've been living with,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, whose district is one of the biggest tobacco producers in the country. `` We hope this is the last we'll hear of this for the time being.'' Technically, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote was on the procedure lawmakers will follow when they debate the transportation spending bill on Thursday, and other issues were involved. But floor debate over the provision was dominated by the smoking ban question.

<HEAD>Florida Governor Gives Bush Anti-Drug Recommendations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> brought President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a thick packet of recommendations Wednesday from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on how to wage the war on drugs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to forward the proposals swiftly to drug policy chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who is due to unveil a new national drug-fighting strategy next month. The governors' 10-point plan, approved at their summer meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Tuesday, endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a hemispheric drug summit and urged that foreign aid be tied to countries' cooperating with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to eradicate drugs. `` The loss of a generation of young people because of the abuse of drugs ... is the most serious issue facing the nation,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said after emerging from the Oval Office. Providing `` a larger carrot ... in foreign aid and perhaps a better deal on the reduction of the world debt, I believe, is a good way to go,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. He added that a new extradition treaty with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> with `` some teeth'' is also needed. The governors also urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to convert idle military bases into federal drug prisons. `` The land is there. The facilities are there. It's a question many times of perimeter fences, so we're not talking big money on most of these items that we are submitting to the White House,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` did not indicate to me how close they were in developing the policy,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. He said they also discussed the congressional primary results in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> captured the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination for the seat of the late <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. The Democratic race is headed for a Aug. 15 runoff, two weeks before the special election. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he also informed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> vote Tuesday calling for a two-year moratorium on expanding Medicaid. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who has called a special session of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislature Oct. 10 to seek stricter limits on abortion, said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not discuss abortion. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lawmakers will be the first to tackle the issue since the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling giving states more authority to restrict abortions. The governor said he was trying `` to balance the rights of women and the unborn child.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he favors changing state law to declare the fetus viable at the 20th week instead of the 24th, to impose higher medical standards for abortion clinics, and to require attending physicians to counsel women about `` the health of the unborn baby'' before performing abortions. `` I can not imagine anyone who would like to see an unborn baby that's viable aborted,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who said he supports state funding of abortion for poor women only in cases of rape or incest or if the woman's life is threatened. Asked about polls that indicated most Floridians were pro-choice, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said, `` It depends which polls you look at. ... I've seen enough polls to know that people do not want abortion to be a system of birth control. I'm also confident that the Floridians do not want to see a viable baby aborted.''

<HEAD>Soviet, Chinese and American Students Work Together on Play</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a tranquil, tree-lined park near the prairie, teen-agers from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been writing a play they hope will help make their dreams of peace come true. The script developed over the past two weeks opens with characters from each country on a stage behind a mountain topped with a star. Discord among them is represented by fog as they struggle musically, occasionally striking a note of harmony. At the end of the play, the star on the mountain comes to the characters, and pieces of the mountain form a bridge to the audience. `` Our goal must be to show peace and friendship,'' said <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jian </PERSON>, one of two 16-year-olds from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> who joined two others from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in writing the script. The Chinese participants are leaving Thursday, but next summer, 15 students from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> to work with young American artists on the performance. The play, financed through an assortment of private and public sources, then is scheduled to tour the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` It's really a process to create a link between the people of these nations,'' says <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Chepulis </PERSON>, director of the `` Imagine'' program at the <ORGANIZATION> Trollwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Set on a 44-acre park in this city of 100,000, <PERSON> Trollwood </PERSON> was created in 1978 following the model of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wolf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trap </ORGANIZATION>, to offer young people a chance to study the performing arts. More than 300 students come each summer. The involvement of the Soviet and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students, who arrived last month, began with a visit by Trollwood founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1986. He proposed an exchange, about the same time <PERSON> Chepulis </PERSON> was proposing an exchange with students from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` In our own naive way, we said, ` Why do n't we do both?''' <PERSON> Chepulis </PERSON> recalled. Officials in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> supported the idea. `` What we really strive for is creativity and confidence,'' <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> said, `` with the attitude that you need to be friends before you can write a play. `` To me, the whole way this project started was a dream. Everybody wants to have a peaceful world. What better way to show that than through the arts?'' The play, with a working title `` Imagine,'' aims to be a celebration of the three cultures and a challenge to others to imagine what it would be like if people of all countries could work together. It is designed as a rock opera with the story conveyed through music and movement instead of words. One of the Chinese student advisers is <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, 49, whose performance as the `` Monkey King'' is a highlight of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> said he was not worried that the recent violence that followed student demonstrations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would threaten the program, even though it did delay the students' arrival in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. But they preferred not to talk about it. `` What it really made me realize is that it was just people to people, and that's all we were interested in. I think ... they just wanted to focus the project,'' <PERSON> Chepulis </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Garcia Marquez Awarded Prize For Contributing To Latin Unity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The unity and freedom of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a `` dream within a dream'' that must soon become reality, author <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> said Wednesday as he accepted an award for his contributions to the fulfillment of that dream. `` In his prose, <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> presents the various facets of the vision of a single <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Olloqui </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serfin </ORGANIZATION>, told 300 people at the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> presidential residence. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> presented the Serfin Prize to the Nobel prize-winning author but made no remarks. The prize carries no monetary award, a bank official said. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> grappled with the problem of Latin unity in his latest book, `` The General in his Labyrinth,'' a controversial novel cast as a deathbed narrative by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON>, a hero of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Bolivar's goal was not just independence but the creation of a united <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> federation to compete with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. That vision dissolved into the separate nations, including <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The book has created a literary controversy because it deals with a sensitive subject and because of its demythologizing portrayal of the man known as `` the Liberator'' as a foul-mouthed libertine. In his brief remarks, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> began by recounting a story by Italian author <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvino </PERSON> in which an emperor of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> asks a painter to portray a crab. The painter replies that it will take five years and he'll need a house with 12 servants. When the five years are up, he asks for another five years. When the emperor comes back again, the painter rises, snatches up his brush and in an instant paints the most beautiful crab ever seen. `` In this story from ancient <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> you can see a crude representation of artistic creation, the most incomprehensible and enslaving of human passions,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> said. The 20th century, which has `` unleashed the furies of the atom as a servant of death, and seen a flag planted on the windless wastes of the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>,'' might be just another of man's many lost centuries if if were not for a dream. `` Let us dream aloud, then. Let us dream that a fundamental change has started in the world, that the craziest concentration of power in the history of mankind is ending because the dogmas that sustained the two sides are breaking down, and we are headed for a new millenium dominated by the freedom of creative thought.'' Inside those dreams, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquz </PERSON> said, lies <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON>'s dream, the dream of a united <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, `` finally part of the torrent of history, made up of our invincible culture, our inspired nightmares, our crazy magic, of the disasters that revive us, and the irresistible power of the imagination. `` Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Latin Americans all, I think it is time for us to draw the crab.''

<HEAD>Cost of Farming Continues to Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cost of running the nation's farms rose 7.5 percent to $ 118.4 billion in 1988, with farmers paying the bulk of their money for basics such as feed, stock and machinery, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Despite the increase, the figure falls short of the record $ 131.8 billion farmers spent in 1981, just before the general financial crunch that stalled expansion in the agricultural sector. In 1987, farmers spent $ 110.1 billion for the buildings, feed, livestock, rent, labor, seeds and plants, fuels, equipment and other components of raising livestock and crops. Average expenditures per farm last year were $ 54,956, an increase of $ 4,165 from 1987. The increase outstripped the nation's overall inflation rate, which was 4.4 percent last year. Farms with annual sales of more than $ 100,000 averaged $ 271,481 in expenditures and accounted for 68 percent of the total expenses. They spent most of their money on services, feed, labor, livestock and poultry, farm machinery, interest and fertilizer. Farms with sales of $ 40,000 to $ 100,000 had expenses averaging $ 75,371 and contributed 16 percent of the total. Their main expenses were services, feed and machinery. Small farms, those with sales under $ 40,000, averaged expenses of $ 15,464 and accounted for 15 percent of the total. Feed, farm services and farm machinery were the leading expenses. Feed was the highest single cost item at $ 17.9 billion dollars in 1988, accounting for 15.1 percent of total costs. The previous year, feed cost $ 14.9 billion dollars and accounted for 13.5 percent of expenses, the highest single expense item that year as well. The livestock and poultry that devour that feed cost $ 13.6 billion, accounting for 11.5 percent of the total. Last year, the cattle, swine and poultry, including stud services, cost $ 10.7 billion, accounting for 9.7 percent of the total. The machinery to do the farm work cost $ 11.5 billion, for 9.7 percent of total expenses, up from $ 10.9 billion. A composite category _ farm services, including rent, _ was the largest one, $ 24.6 billion, accounting for 21 percent of the nation's production expenses. That's up from $ 24 billion in 1987. That category includes cash and share rent, vet supplies and services, marketing and storage expenses, insurance, utilities, leasing and transportation. The only expenses to drop were interest payments, which decreased 3.7 percent to $ 8.37 billion, and building and fencing, which dropped 10.3 percent to $ 2.23 billion. The analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not include figures for net income or profits. Annual spending by farmers reached its nadir this decade in 1986, when many massively cut back their capital investments during a time of plummeting land values and rising debt burdens.

<HEAD>Japan's Governing Party Poised to Pick Ex-minister to Lead Nation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister with reform credentials emerged Wednesday as the clear front-runner for prime minister after maneuvering within the governing party, which is beset by scandal and plummeting popularity. Former education minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> was the only declared candidate after a day of meetings by <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders. The party is expected to elect a new party president on Tuesday and then vote him in as prime minister on Aug. 10. With its large majority in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the party can be assured of victory in the vote for prime minister. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, gained support, though lukewarm, from enough party factions to make him the leading contender. No other strong candidate was put forward, but other people could still be championed until Saturday morning. The former minister would succeed Prime Minister Sousuke Uno. He resigned last month after only eight weeks in office in the wake of a sex scandal and a severe loss in the July 23 election for the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Uno was accused of keeping paid mistresses. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> belongs to one of the smallest factions in the conservative governing party, a position that normally would have made him an unlikely choice for high office. In addition, he has not held the key Cabinet posts or top party jobs that are normally part of a prime minister's background. But leaders of all the bigger party factions are tainted by responsibility for the election defeat or by a bribery scandal that toppled <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. `` I hope I can get as much support from the party as possible,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told reporters after his faction united behind him. `` I'm overwhelmed by the honor and will do my best. He said it was too early to answer questions about details of his policy ideas. `` But political reform is the biggest issue that has been raised by the people,'' he said. Party members have called for political reform to help restore public trust eroded by the bribery scandal. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> acknowledged he had accepted political donations from the company at the hub of the scandal, the Recruit Co. information conglomerate. He said Recruit had contributed about $ 110,000 to his political coffers over five years, but the money had been properly reported. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said he stopped receiving Recruit money after the scandal emerged last year. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, a longtime member of the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, belongs to the political reform committee set up by the party to deal with the scandal. From 1974 to 1976, he was deputy chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary under the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miki </PERSON>, who sought to clean up <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s money politics when he succeeded scandal-plagued Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> later served as education minister for two periods of about a year each. His candidacy had been rumored since the weekend, when party Secretary-General <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>'s bid began to falter. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> became the clear front-runner Wednesday after his mentor and faction leader, 78-year-old <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Komoto </PERSON>, said he had decided not to run. The next prime minister must deal not only with the party's scandals but also with widespread opposition to a new 3 percent sales tax

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel who boarded a Taiwanese drift net vessel suspected of involvement in a scheme to sell $ 1.3 million worth illegally caught fish reported Wednesday that its holds were filled with salmon. Taiwanese enforcement officers and observers from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <PERSON> Morganthau </PERSON> boarded the Sung Ching No. 1 early Wednesday about 75 miles off <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Morganthau </PERSON> had been shadowing the Sung Ching No. 1 for more than two weeks in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sought permission from the government of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel to board. The Taiwanese initially refused, then decided to dispatch their own law enforcement officials to the ship and allow a joint-boarding party. `` All the holds were filled with salmon,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. After the boarding, the vessel was turned over to Taiwanese officials The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> demanded that the vessel's crew be prosecuted under Taiwanese law, which restricts the export of salmon and limits where Taiwanese drift net vessels are allowed to fish. The Sung Ching No. 1 was one of at least two Taiwanese drift net vessels implicated in the illegal sale of salmon to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> undercover agents posing as fish buyers in a six-month sting operation. Last month, federal agents arrested two Taiwanese men as they emerged from a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> bank vault carrying more than $ 1 million in cash allegedly received as payment for 500 metric tons of illegally caught fish. At the same time the arrests were made, the Sung Ching No. 1 and another Taiwanese ship were rendezvousing with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government chartered fishing tender <ORGANIZATION> Redfin </ORGANIZATION> north of <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to deliver the fish. When the captains of the two vessels boarded the Redfin to arrange details of the fish transfer they were detained, but their vessels fled as the <PERSON> Morganthau </PERSON> approached. While the <PERSON> Morganthau </PERSON> tracked the Sung Ching No. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Redfin </ORGANIZATION> followed the other boat for several days before running short of supplies and heading for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said the discovery of a `` huge quantity'' of salmon aboard the Sung Ching No. 1 gives Taiwanese authorities `` plenty of evidence to go along with what we have already provided, and it is up to them to throw the book at these outlaws.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing groups claim that illegal drift netting by vessels from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has already had a serious impact on salmon runs in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

 Federal savings and loan regulators have authorized the nation's eighth largest thrift institution to become a commercial bank, potentially reducing revenue to the beleaguered fund insuring S & amp; L deposits by millions of dollars.

The bank board's decision is generating criticism in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to pass legislation this week committing taxpayers to spending billions of dollars to bail out the S & amp; L industry. As part of the price for the bailout, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will continue to pay higher insurance premiums than banks for the next five years, even if they convert to a bank. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said regulators may have had no choice but to rule in favor of Home Federal. But, he added, `` I think it's awful. It sends a terrible signal. ... If there was a legal way to avoid the decision, it should have been done.'' Home Federal is hoping to get out of <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> under a provision of 1987 banking legislation that permits institutions to leave provided they applied before March 31, 1987. Home Federal filed its applications to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and state regulators a day before the deadline. It is unclear, however, if that loophole will still be good if Home Federal, as expected, is unable to complete its conversion before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacts new <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation, which has provisions that would supersede the law passed two years ago. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchman </PERSON>, a bank board staff attorney, said the Home Federal decision will not set a precedent favorable to several other large S & amp; Ls trying to bolt the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. Two Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls _ <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION>, the largest and second-largest thrifts in the nation _ are also trying to leave <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. The bank board denied Great Western's application and, in June, the thrift lost an attempt to overturn the decision in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It is appealing the ruling. The bank board has until October to rule on the application from Home Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The bank board has allowed 13 other S & amp; Ls to secede from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> under the 1987 law, all considerably smaller than Home Federal. Home Federal, ranked eighth in the nation with $ 17.2 billion in assets at the end of May, has about 200 branches throughout <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Last year, it paid $ 13.7 million more in insurance premiums than it would have as a bank. Both bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L premiums would be raised under the S & amp; L bill, but Home Federal would still pay about $ 9 million less in premiums as a bank.

<HEAD>Senior State Department Official To Visit Sudan on Aid Cutoff</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official will visit <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> on Sunday to decide whether <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should freeze $ 108 million in aid because of a military coup a month ago, a Western official said. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, is to determine whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law requires the funding cutoff, which would not affect about $ 100 million in annual humanitarian aid, the official told foreign reporters. Section 513 to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 1987 Foreign Assistance Act stipulates that economic aid must cease to a country where a democratically elected government is removed in violation of the country's constitution, said the official on condition of anonymity <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> in 1986 became the first country to have its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid halted under provisions of Section 513, he said. However, the law, known as Section 513, `` includes a waiver provision related to national security interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> will explore the possibility of using the waiver, depending on how the new Sudanese government will deal with certain issues,'' the official said. He said said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> will study the position of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON>, who with other middle-level field-grade officers overthrew Sudanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s government on June 30. The official said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> will gauge el-Bashir's stands on two key sore points between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>. One is ending the southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> civil war and the other is allowing delivery of relief supplies to southerners suffering from a famine the 6-year-old war has caused. The law puts at stake $ 108 million committed to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, the official said. Already, $ 22 million in development and economic aid has been frozen since January under rules requiring it after a country faces back debt payments on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government loans for more than a year. But the official stressed that neither Section 513 nor that rule, called the <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION>, affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries. That amounted to $ 100 million dollars in the past year. He said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> believes <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> is ready to take the steps necessary to end the war. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, who last month took over as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, already began mediating between el-Bashir and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is supported by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Exploratory peace talks are to start in the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> this week. The Western official said he believes the talks may succeed because both <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> are economically exhausted by the long struggle. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s African tour started in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to see how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can help <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, as <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> chairman, end several regional African conflicts. Among them are those between <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, estimated at $ 250 billion, is another item on <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s agenda during his tour, which also will take him to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Red Cross Launches Campaign To Prevent Child Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> launched a national campaign Wednesday aimed at preventing child deaths from choking, suffocation and drowning. The Infant and Child CPR Campaign encourages parents, grandparents, baby sitters and other care-givers to learn how to handle breathing emergencies in infants and children. Actress <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who has an 18-month-old boy, lent her name to the campaign. `` There's a lot a parent can do before the ambulance arrives,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnside </PERSON>, director of health services for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The Heimlich maneuver, however, is not among them. That method of using abdominal thrusts to dislodge obstructions in the breathing passages works on choking adults but does more harm than good when used on a baby, <PERSON> Burnside </PERSON> said. A choking baby needs to be held in a certain way and be given a series of blows to the back and thrusts to the chest to restore breathing, he said. The technique taught in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infant </ORGANIZATION> and Child CPR course was highlighted in a segment of the CBS daytime drama `` The Young and the Restless'' Wednesday when a choking emergency occurred to a young child. Besides choking emergencies, the seven-hour <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> course teaches mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and injury prevention. Thousands of children who die from choking, suffocation and drowning could be saved if more adults knew how to respond to the emergencies, <PERSON> Burnside </PERSON> said. Choking and suffocation are leading causes of accidental deaths in children under 1 year old, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Among children ages 1-4, drowning is the second leading cause of accidental deaths after motor vehicle accidents.

<HEAD>Plant Workers Say Government Lied on Nuclear Health Hazards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers at government nuclear weapons plants told a congressional panel Wednesday they were deceived for decades by superiors on the health hazards of working with radioactive materials such as plutonium and uranium. `` We were told the levels were too low to harm us,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, a worker and union official at the Fernald uranium processing plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. He said superiors told him over the years that handling the radioactive materials `` was like working with lead'' and no more a risk than crossing the street. The testimony came before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which said there have been at least 30 studies over the years describing various health problems among workers and residents near the Energy Department facilities. `` The historical record provides little comfort,'' said committee chairman Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, D-Ohio. He said workers at plant sites must be assured they are protected from health and safety dangers and be provided accurate information on health risks. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> acknowledged the department's program to determine the health hazards facing weapons plant workers is `` a mess. He said the department has no clear picture of how much physical harm workers have suffered over the years from exposure to radioactive materials and wastes. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said that when he took over the department in March, he found the program to follow such health effects `` buried deep within the bureaucracy ... understaffed, under funded and under utilized.'' But he balked at suggestions by <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and other senators that an outside agency should oversee the department's monitoring program. `` I now it's a mess. I need people to clean it up more than I need oversight right now,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> testified. The department's own information is so bad, said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, he has relied heavily on outside scientific review panels. `` Sometimes the reports coming in from the field are not really true,'' said the secretary. He said statistical information on past worker exposure to radiation at and near the plants is being examined again to more accurately guage the health risks. He also said information on the health of 600,000 present and past plant workers is being assembled and will be made available to outside scientists, but the central data bank is not expected to be completed until 1995. The secretary promised a shakeup in the department's health monitoring program and said it would be opened to review by an outside committee of experts. A panel of plant workers and union representatives voiced similar concerns. The history of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on health and safety issues `` is one of denial, coverup, inefficiency and betrayal,'' declared <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wages </PERSON>, a vice president of the Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The union represents 5,000 workers at various nuclear weapons facilities. Wages said questions about worker safety and exposure to hazardous materials was raised nearly two decades ago in congressional hearings and elsewhere, but nothing changed. Wages and other union officials, as well as several present employees at plants, said too often workers have kept silent for fear of losing their jobs and because of repeated assurances that the health concerns were being exaggerated by critics. `` We are the guinea pigs. We perform important and dangerous work, but are made to feel expendable,'' said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Abney </PERSON>, 55, a chemical operator at the Fernald plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Tests have shown <PERSON> Abney </PERSON> to have plutonium in his body and uranium in his lungs. `` Despite my precautions -LRB- at work over the years -RRB- I am contaminated,'' he told the senators and noted rumors the government may close the Fernald plant in the near future. `` Will I be able to find another job and still support my family? Would another company be willing to cover me under their health insurance?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Survey: Many Teachers Feel More Training Needed on Child Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Elementary-school teachers are underreporting child-abuse cases because they are n't adequately trained to recognize or deal with them, according to a study released Wednesday. Fifty-seven percent of the more than 2.1 million reports of child abuse and neglect in 1986 involved school-age children, but only 16.3 percent of all reports filed with child-protective agencies originated with school personnel, said the study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. `` The results of the survey point out a major problem in our efforts to prevent child abuse,'' said committee Executive Director <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>. All states require teachers to report instances of child abuse, Ms. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. But the committee's survey found that only 50 percent of the 480 elementary-school teachers polled had received any training in the identification, reporting and prevention of such cases, she said. Most who said they received such training said it was inadequate. The teachers surveyed taught first grade through sixth grade in 39 school districts nationwide, Ms. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. The Chicago-based committee, described as a national, volunteer-based organization, tried to assess teachers' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about child abuse, as well as their opinions on reporting child abuse and on prevention programs. Seventy-two percent of the teachers surveyed said they suspected that at least one of their students had been abused or neglected, and 90 percent said they had reported such cases, Ms. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. However, reports commonly went to other school personnel, such as a principal, social worker or nurse. Only about 20 percent of the teachers said they reported abuse directly to child-protective agencies, as required by most states' laws. Only 57 percent of those polled said their districts had clearly defined polices on reporting suspicions of child abuse. Twenty-four percent did n't know if their districts had such policies, although 95 percent of the nation's districts say they have clearly set guidelines for teachers to follow, Ms. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. `` Not only are many teachers unaware of the existence of those school policies, but many do not seem to understand the policies that do exist,'' she said. According to the survey, teachers are concerned about the legal ramifications of reporting child abuse even though most states grant immunity from lawsuits to teachers who report child-abuse suspicions in good faith, Ms. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said her organization believes administrators need to `` dramatically expand the education they provide their teachers so that ... teachers can feel much more comfortable and much more competent in their ability to identify and report child abuse.'' The survey also asked teachers about corporal punishment and found that 57 percent felt it should be eliminated. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Abolish Corporal Punishment in Schools, said the drive to stop corporal punishment received a big boost this year, with eight states banning the practice. `` For the first time in the history of our country's education system, more than half of the school children in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> now attend schools that have prohibited hitting, slapping, punching, hair-pulling, paddling or other firms of corporal punishment by educators,'' <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is forecast to become a net importer of rice for the first time in recent history, helping create a record worldwide trade in rice in 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The report, `` Rice: Situation and Outlook Yearbook,'' says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are fueling this year's record demand, with trade forecast at 13.4 million metric tons. The previous record was 13.1 million metric tons set in 1981, the report said. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will increase its exports 10 percent this year to 2.5 million metric tons, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> will be the big winner, exporting a record 5.5 million metric tons. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the export, 19 percent, and the Thai share, 41 percent, will be the same as last year, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has already bought 950,000 tons from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which has been exporting rice at `` an extraordinary pace'' since August 1988, the report said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is expected to buy 1.2 million tons of rice this year from all sources, the report said. That is triple the amount bought the previous year. The report said `` it is unclear how or if the current turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will affect its short-term rice trade.'' `` There have been few reports of exports in the first half of 1989, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is forecast to export only 300,000 tons by the end of the year, less than half the amount it exported in 1988,'' the report said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> will also account for about a 5 percent drop in the 1990 market when their crops improve and stocks are replenished. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> account for over 50 percent of the world's rice production. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> imports rice to feed its urban populations. In the forecast for 1990 contained in the report, the department cites reports that farmers will keep more rice on the farm because of the government system of paying farmers with IOUs that can not be redeemed immediately. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is forecast to import 400,000 tons and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will likely take in 500,000 tons, the report says. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are expecting record crops in the crop year 1989-1990. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are the main rice-growing states. The main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers are <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Low stocks and strong import demand caused world prices to soar starting in January. They reached $ 8.91 per hundredweight in July, after having fallen to $ 5.90 in December 1988. Recent prices were at their lowest in 1986-1987, when abundant world prices kept them down as far as $ 3.78 a hundredweight. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers are planting 2.8 million acres in rice this year, 5 percent less than a year ago, the department estimates. Yields are unlikely to show improvement, meaning a drop in production, the department says.

 A twin-engine plane crashed on takeoff Wednesday at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>'s airport, getting barely aloft before tumbling to the ground and exploding in flames. Six people were killed, authorities said. The Beechcraft Queen Air BE-80 was bound for <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoefer </PERSON>, an air traffic controller at <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Regional Airport. The plane had climbed only about 10 feet off the ground when its right engine caught fire, witnesses said. The plane's right wing then slammed into the ground, spewing fuel as the aircraft cartwheeled several times, the witnesses reported. The plane, engulfed in flames, came to rest upside down and broken apart near the control tower. The fire prevented any rescue, witnesses said. `` There's not much you can do when that gas ignited,'' said off-duty <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who saw the crash. Rescue crews left the victims' bodies in the wreckage until investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> could examine it, said Fire Chief J.D. <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>. `` As far as we can determine now we have six fatalities,'' said <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>. Six people, including the pilot, were driven by van from the terminal and boarded the plane minutes before takeoff, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the van's driver. The victims were not immediately identified. The plane was registered to Rainbow Properties of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Vedder </PERSON> <PERSON> Steed </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official went to southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Wednesday to press the search for the body of a slain American hostage as a glimmer of hope came from the Shiite Moslem camp that a second hostage would be spared. The victim, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, was on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty when he was abducted. <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sources said they expected kidnappers threatening the life of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, to spare him at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s behest to avert a confrontation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Pro-Iranian kidnappers said they hanged <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on Monday in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction Friday of a Lebanese Shiite cleric. The colonel was seized Feb. 17, 1988, near Tyre in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request, would assist in efforts to have <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' body returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he is `` leaving no stone unturned'' in trying to free American hostages but lacks hard information as he tries to deal with the crisis `` in a prudent way.'' He said he contacted many world leaders and `` We have had assurance after assurance ... they want to help.'' British officials in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> talked for 20 minutes about the crisis. A videotape the kidnappers provided shows a man, apparently <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, hanging from a gallows. No body has been found and there is no way of knowing when the tape was made. Some reports have said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was killed months ago. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the USS Belknap, flagship of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 6th Fleet, and the fleet commander canceled a visit to <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in case <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs them, but said a military strike was unlikely. The aircraft carrier <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> cut short a visit to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, they said. <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary-general for peacekeeping operations, flew to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the Lebanese border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> by helicopter from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He met with Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Lars-Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahlgren </PERSON>, Swedish commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and battalion commanders of the nine-nation force known as <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' death and try to find his body. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> put off going to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> because of the fighting but would try to make the trip Thursday. Christian forces and a Syrian-led Moslem alliance have fought an artillery war in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for five months. The undersecretary-general is scheduled to meet with Lebanese leaders in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> would not identify them. `` There are no negotiations involved, although he has a secondary mission of trying to find out about other hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the spokesman said. Sixteen Westerners are captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 44, commanded a 75-man observer team attached to the 5,800-member <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> force. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s captors, who call themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday he would be killed unless <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> freed <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> by 6 p.m. the next day. Two hours after the Tuesday deadline, the kidnappers announced a `` non-extendable postponement'' of 48 hours. No specific hour on Thursday was mentioned as a new deadline. The statement cited a plea for mercy from <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s Lebanese wife, <PERSON> Elham </PERSON>, and other `` friendly appeals and sincere behests.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> said Wednesday: `` Even if it was a postponement for only one minute, it's better than nothing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sources said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might have stepped in to save <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> because of the international uproar created by <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' death. An organization caling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> claimed to hold <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Nearly all the groups holding hostages are believed to be fronts for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> movement in which <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is a spiritual leader. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to exchange <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> prisoners for the foreign hostages and three of its soldiers held prisoner in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> rejected the deal. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign minister, said Wednesday there was a `` good possibility'' hostages would be freed, but other officials said negotiations could be lengthy. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> sponsors <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which also holds two of the three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Israeli commandos abducted <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, 33, and two aides from his home in Jibchit, a south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> village. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> denies any connection with the hostages, but publicly endorsed the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> group when it claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction. One Lebanese Shiite source said: `` The Iranians probably are bringing immense pressure on their Lebanese surrogates, seeking to defuse the crisis generated by <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' murder. They can do without a showdown with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, just elected president of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, has sought improved relations with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the past in hopes of aid in rebuilding from eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Other Shiite sources said the emergence of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s most powerful politician had meant a decline in the influence over <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> of a hard-line rival, Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> Analysts say the hostages' fate may be dictated by the struggle between those known as pragmatists, led by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, and hard-liners over the direction of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old Islamic revolution. The first Shiite source noted that <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> is not known to have killed a hostage, but has issued death threats in the past. The Revolutionary Justice statement announcing the 48-hour postponement for <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> was accompanied by a picture of another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage it holds, writer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 58. Statements from the group threatened both men's lives twice in 1988. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> was acting comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was abducted from its campus on Sept. 12, 1986.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> man whose Costa Rican ranch allegedly served as a way station for guns-for-drugs trades to aid the Contra rebels surfaced here Wednesday after fleeing an indictment in that Central American nation. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, who was out on $ 37,500 bond on charges he violated Costa Rican neutrality and trafficked in cocaine, said he slipped away about a week ago. The drug counts were dropped Wednesday by a judge, but the neutrality charges remain. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the 69-year-old rancher faces a subpoena by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee looking into similar charges, as well as a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into an allegation he fraudulently obtained a $ 375,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> development loan. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> vehemently denied all the accusations Wednesday in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, saying the charges against him were really charges against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` The Costa Ricans are accusing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the past president and the current president of being drug traffickers,'' he said. The former <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, resident, who has lived in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for 20 years, said he was just a `` patriotic American'' who gave humanitarian aid to the Contras seeking to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. He said the accusations had been pushed by communists and `` drug people.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors say they have no evidence to support the drug charges, but insist <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was more active than he admits in helping former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> aid the Contras even after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off funding. A chart prepared by then-Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1986 put <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> directly under North and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> acknowledges receiving about $ 10,000 a month from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> to feed and supply the rebels, but denies knowing the money was provided on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s orders. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> also denied working for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, saying <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was simply an `` old friend'' he knew through the office of then-Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind However, he said he had frequent contact with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents. `` Constantly there were <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> people passing through the zone,'' he said. `` They would visit my house, they would ask questions about locations of farms ... it was obvious they were wanting information about air drops and so forth. `` The same as any patriotic American would do, I cooperated with the agencies of my government,'' <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was most angry about testimony before a drug subcommittee headed by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., that airstrips on his ranch were used as refueling and transfer stations by pilots bringing in guns for the Contras and taking cocaine and marijuana back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Convicted drug traffickers <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON> testified that they used <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch for cocaine flights. Other witnesses, including former <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> official <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, said they knew of drugs passing through <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>'s testimony was just an attempt to win lighter sentences. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> counsel <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON> said the subcommittee wanted to talk to <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> as soon as possible. `` Hull is under subpoena and has been for a year, and we will seek to serve him,'' <PERSON> Winer </PERSON> said. `` We've sought to serve him before, but he has been in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, and, from our point of view, evading the subpoena.'' <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> said he was willing to talk. However, he has accused <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> of being a communist, and, according to the subcommittee, at one point tried to stall the panel's investigation by filing a flood of false affidavits with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> may also have to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about alleged fraud involving a 1983 loan from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> blamed the agency, rather than himself, for any confusion over the $ 375,000 loan, and insisted it has been paid back. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, saying he suffers from a heart condition and diabetes, said he mainly returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to seek medical treatment. He said he has no money, and intends to return to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> until he is treated. `` Then I want to return to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I have faith in the Costa Rican judicial system.''

<HEAD>Officials Discuss Clean Air Plan with Environmental Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top administration officials met Wednesday with environmental leaders to discuss criticisms of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air plan, won praise for keeping an open White House door but received no blanket commitment of support. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his environmental advisory team invited the environmentalists to discuss the acid rain provision of the clean air package and promised later meetings on the airborne toxics and urban smog sections which have prompted the most criticism from environmental activists and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Environmental Defense Fund, which has praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to curb acid rain, will lobby for that aspect of the president's package on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON> said after the White House session He said the acid rain portion `` is stronger than anything being offered'' in competing legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for `` taking leadership'' on the environment that represented a `` sea change'' from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said his organization still has reservations about the provisions, in part focusing on the way the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calculated gaseous emissions that cause acid rain. The administration claims its plan will result in a 10 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from 1980 levels, but the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION>'s calculations are it will be only 9 million tons since 1 million ton reduction has already been achieved. The meeting was the latest effort by the administration to take the offensive on its clean air bill after weeks of criticism from environmental groups and their congressional backers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dropped by the meeting only briefly, participants said. Environmental Protection Agency Assistant Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said the meeting was called to `` continue the dialogue'' with environmental groups. However, he insisted the administration was not positioning to make changes in the bill it sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month. `` We're talking about clarifying our position, their position. Sometimes there are interpretation questions that need to be raised where we say one thing and different people read it for different results. At this point it's an information discussion and not a negotiating session. The administration's bill stands as it is,'' he said. Last week, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> accused Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of making `` unfair and totally biased attacks'' on the legislation and of falsely calling the proposal a sellout to industry. <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> said the administration officials at the meeting were `` very upset by the criticism the bill has got from the environmental community and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We responded with equal vehemence that we do n't think you've been unfairly attacked. We believe what we're saying is based on the facts.'' Administration officials have complained that the environmental critics are nitpicking the bill after the administration solicited their views and addressed many of their concerns in the package. `` They certainly would like us to be more positive than we have been. I would like to be more positive than we've been able to be,'' <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, praised the administration for continued consultation with the environmentalists. `` Clearly they were stating that they were opening the door and it's up to us to work with them,'' he said. But a number of organizations in the main environmental lobbying group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, were not invited _ including the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, director of the coalition, said he was invited only 15 minutes before the session, after he complained to administration officials. But White House spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said it had been thought that <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> might be more appropriately invited to the later sessions on urban smog and toxics than to Wednesday's meeting on acid rain. An <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking only on condition he not be named, said the White House issued the invitations, and both <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> `` were shocked that <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> was not invited.'' The source said the two <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials demanded that the White House invite <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>. `` The point they may have misjudged somewhat is that the coalition works together,'' <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> said. `` I speak for the coalition.'' The director of Environmental Action, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, accused the White House of trying to `` fracture the coalition.'' Others invited included representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas fought overnight battles with government soldiers on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s northern outskirts, and others attacked at least four towns Wednesday Six people were reported killed and more than 10 wounded in the towns. At least one soldier and a civilian were killed and three people were wounded in the battles Tuesday night in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> and Mejicanos, working-class areas on the city's northern edge. Venceremos, the guerrilla radio station, said the attacks on towns were part of a rebel campaign against `` the fascist government'' of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and `` increases in transportation costs and repression in general.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s conservative administration lifted price controls on about 200 consumer items and services earlier this week, including transportation and electricity, in an effort to revive the war-battered economy. Bus fares increased Wednesday, in some cases to almost double their former levels. New electricity rates will be announced next week. Guerrillas of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has fought U.S.-supported governments for a decade. Human rights groups say more than 70,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians. Several rebel columns attacked military positions at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nonualco </LOCATION>, 38 miles east of the capital, early Wednesday and one civilian was killed in the fighting, the army press office said. A Venceremos broadcast told people to stay off the road in the area because rebel forces had mined it. One rebel was killed and five were wounded in a guerrilla attack on military positions in northern <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province, near the Honduran border, and other rebel forces attacked <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jorge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, an eastern province, the army said. There were no reports on casualties in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jorge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who commands a squad of 10 soldiers in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> district, one of the areas of overnight fighting, said his post was attacked by about 60 rebels from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> volcano northeast of the city. He said the guerrilas, armed with dynamite, assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, were driven off by about 100 soldiers from the <PERSON> Belloso </PERSON> infantry battalion. It was the fifth rebel attack in eight months on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> army post. About 200 guerrillas are believed to be camped on the volcano.

<HEAD>Justice Department May Crack Down on News Leakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials who leak information to news reporters about federal criminal investigations may be prosecuted for theft of government property under a new policy announced Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The department has decided to narrow a 11-year-old policy against prosecuting officials who leak information to inform the public, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>, a deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division, said in written testimony submitted to a congressional hearing. In some circumstances, reporters may be called to testify at grand juries to identify leakers, although a subpoena would not be issued without the approval of the attorney general, <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said. This aspect of the new policy, which was unveiled at a joint hearing of two House Judiciary subcommittees, means the change could have little practical effect on leak investigations. Attorneys general historically have been unwilling to subpoena reporters, who are usually the only source of evidence about who leaked them information. But the new policy drew expressions of concern from civil libertarians who said it could be used to undermine a reporters' First Amendment protection against revealing confidential sources of information `` Once the government is able to say ` we need this information because it's material to a criminal investigation,' that raises the question of whether or not the protection of a confidential source is diluted,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> media lawyer and former legislative counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it would be a definite misuse of the statute. The statute was not designed with that in mind at all,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of one of the subcommittees `` It would be a very dangerous practice.'' The policy in force since 1978 stated that `` it is inappropriate to bring a prosecution'' under the theft of government property law if information is leaked to inform the public and was n't obtained by illegal means, such as wiretaps or trespassing, <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said in testimony prepared for the committee. The guideline, contained in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Attorneys Manual, was designed `` to protect ` whistleblowers' and also to protect members of the media from prosecution for receipt of stolen property.'' `` We have examined this policy and concluded it is too broad,' <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said. `` Accordingly it is no longer applicable to government employees who leak information obtained from a criminal investigation.'' `` Moreover, we will now consider prosecution of government employees under section 641 -LRB- the theft statute -RRB- in leak cases not arising out of criminal investigations if the employee's conduct also violated some other provision such as the Privacy Act,'' <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said in his prepared statement. Such a leak could come from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background investigation of someone under consideration for a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> position, such as former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, whose nomination to be defense secretary was killed amidst allegations of womanizing and drinking. Leaks of information from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background investigation of Tower drew criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and expressions of consternation by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said the `` department is in the process of deciding whether the policy should be changed in other respects.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, legislative counsel at the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>'s announcement `` rather disturbing. <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>'s testimony was delivered at a hearing convened in the wake of congressional concern about leaks revealing a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into financial irregularities in the office of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa. The investigation was disclosed during <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s ultimately successful campaign to become <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzaga </PERSON>, a singer and accordion player who almost singlehandedly popularized the lilting music of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s rural northeast, died Wednesday of pneumonia. He was 76. <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> suffered from osteoporosis, a disease that weakens the bones, and had been hospitalized for more than a month in <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION>, 1,500 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, hospital officials said by telephone. <PERSON> Gonzaga </PERSON> was born Dec. 13, 1912 in the remote town of <LOCATION> Exu </LOCATION>, in the heart of the arid `` sertao,'' or outback. His father taught him to play the accordion, a popular instrument in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s rural northeast, and at 12 he was performing regularly at local dances. In the 1940s he came to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, where regional music then was virtually unknown. At first considered lowbrow, <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> popularized the `` baiao'' and `` forro'' music. With his moon face and trademark leather hat, typical of northeastern bandits, <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> became a nationally known figure. His music dealt almost exclusively with the hard life in the poor northeast. His greatest success was `` <LOCATION> Asa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branca </LOCATION>,'' or `` White Wing,'' about a peasant regretfully fleeing the drought-stricken backlands but pledging to return when the rains came. <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION>'s body was to be taken back to Exu for burial on Friday.

<HEAD>Conference Committee Puts Off Action On Ancient Forest Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will meet in September on legislation that would impose a 14-month ceasefire in the battle over the ancient forests of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, lawmakers said Wednesday. The lawmakers said the delay until after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' August recess would give them more time to try to negotiate a compromise acceptable to both the timber industry and environmentalists. `` If we can come up with a way to get the job done and soften some of the criticism, we will certainly be looking for that,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash. The conference committee had originally been scheduled to meet this week to discuss the spending bills for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to recess at the end of the week until after Labor Day. Environmentalists oppose the legislation, which would limit their access to the courts to appeal timber sales during the 14-month grace period, and plan to use the month before the conference committee meets to lobby against it. They say logging in the old-growth forests of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> destroys prime nesting areas for the rare northern spotted owl. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, put of the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> because of major differences in the versions of the spending bills adopted by the two chambers. The timber legislation is included as an amendment to the Senate-passed version of the Interior spending bill, but not the one approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Lawmakers said the legislation should ensure a short-term supply of timber for the region's mills while protecting the old-growth forests from logging. A permanent fix would still have to be negotiated. The legislation would bar federal courts from suspending or overturning any timber sales planned in federal forests of the Northwest known to contain spotted owls through the end of fiscal 1990. In addition, the legislation requires that environmentalists release more than half of the roughly two billion board feet of timber currently enjoined from sale. If environmentalists do not agree to release the timber by Oct. 1, the legislation would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with sales regardless of the injunctions.

 A Sri Lankan woman has forfeited $ 75,000 worth of sapphires she put up as a deposit and still owes $ 100,000 after failing to meet the deadline to buy a bankrupt college for $ 10 million, officials said Wednesday. `` We're kind of back to square one. ... It's for sale again,'' said bankruptcy court trustee <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>. Predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> was closed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> last year when officials of the 108-year-old school could n't raise $ 1.85 million needed to cover this school year's deficit. The school, which sits on a 200-acre plot in south <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was saddled with $ 18 million in debt; faculty and staff had worked without pay for about two years and are owed about $ 900,000. A portion of the land has been appraised at about $ 12.6 million. In April, a contract to purchase the school was awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Aryadesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a group represented by <PERSON> Panditha </PERSON> <PERSON> Sujatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadarajah </PERSON>, a Sri Lankan woman whose attorney said she had lived in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> since 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Nadarajah </PERSON> is an internationally known <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> scholar and planned to open an international university at the school, her attorney, A.W. <PERSON> Clem </PERSON>, said in March. Ms. <PERSON> Nadarajah </PERSON> put up five sapphires worth $ 75,000 to seal the deal, and agreed to pay an additional $ 100,000 to get a four-week extension of the original July 4 deadline. After missing Tuesday's deadline to come up with the $ 10 million to buy the college, <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Nadarajah </PERSON> has forfeited the jewels, but has yet to pay the $ 100,000. `` We will have to make demands upon her for the $ 100,000 cash,'' said <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>. Proceeds from the sale of the jewels will go to creditors of the college, <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Nadarajah </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in July to raise the money and <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, said she apparently has had trouble getting out of the island nation off the coast of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has been wracked by two years of fighting between Sinhalese extremists, angered by peace overtures made to the country's Tamil minority and by the continuing presence of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping troops, and the Sinhalese-dominated government. When <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> recommended awarding the contract to Ms. <PERSON> Nadarajah </PERSON>, he said: `` We have investigated her as best we can. It seems that she does indeed have the money.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nadarajah </PERSON>'s attorney did not return phone calls Wednesday. <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> said he already had at least 10 inquiries about buying the college Wednesday morning and hopes media attention will die down. `` I've never had to conduct a business negotiation ... in front of the likes of the media,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moved Wednesday to speed easy passage of a taxpayer bailout of savings and loan losses as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans mounted a final attempt to prevent the costs from swelling the federal deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> set aside one hour of debate for Thursday before a floor vote, anticipated to occur by noon, puts the legislation's fate in the hands of senators deeply divided on how to raise the $ 50 billion needed to close 500 insolvent S & amp; Ls and pay off their depositors. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators from both parties agreed last week to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recommended massive overhaul of the way the government regulates the nation's nearly 3,000 thrift institutions. And House Republicans generally have folded their opposition to Democratic demands that the rescue money be borrowed through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> _ a move that would swell the deficit by some $ 9 billion this year and $ 24 billion in fiscal 1990. However, the parties are deadlocked in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where 41 Republicans _ one more than needed to thwart the bill's approval _ have said in a letter they would hold out for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s elaborate financing scheme. That effort was being led by Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, co-author of the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law mandating a federal deficit no greater than $ 110 billion for the next fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bailout plan would raise the deficit at most only $ 5 billion a year by borrowing the money through higher-interest bonds on the private market. Critics contend the higher interest rates would cost taxpayers a total of $ 4.5 billion more than necessary over the next 30 years. Senate GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> on Tuesday threatened to tie the S & amp; L measure to a bill raising the government's debt ceiling above $ 2.8 trillion as a parliamentary tactic if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tried to recess for the rest of the month before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., however, said Wednesday he has no intention of recessing until after both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have acted on the S & amp; L bill as well as the debt ceiling Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, another co-author of the deficit-reduction law, said he remains solidly with <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> but added he did not know about the other 39 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators who had signed the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican's letter. `` I do n't know what the vote count is, I do n't think anybody does,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said. However, support for <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and the administration's efforts was clearly waning among House Republicans. `` I understand the administration's concern, but it's a hard thing to sell when you get everything else in place and have it hung up on that one issue,'' said House GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` We've got some problems with our counterparts in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday overwhelmingly ratified a new contract that will raise salaries at the newspaper by about $ 165 per week over the next five years.

The contract was tentatively approved last Friday after all-night negotiations. In addition to newsroom workers, employees in the paper's accounting, advertising, circulation and data-processing departments are covered by the agreement The contract is the first between the paper and the guild in nearly three years. The previous pact expired in 1986, and newspaper officials declared that negotiations had reached an impasse a year later. To protest the slow pace in the contract talks, many Post reporters removed their bylines from stories on the two anniversaries of the breakdown in discussions. The new contract raises salaries between 4 percent and 6 percent a year, with lower-paid workers receiving a higher percentage increase along with improvements in minimum salary scales. The average salary for Post reporters is more than $ 52,000 per year.

 Divers on Wednesday found the bodies of three men aboard a drilling rig that capsized while fleeing Hurricane Chantal, and the search continued for seven missing crewmen, officials said. The search of the floating rig, which overturned Monday, was delayed earlier in the day by strong currents and high seas. The bodies were recovered from the vessel's crew quarters, said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials earlier speculated that crewmen may have survived the accident if they were trapped in the watertight crew quarters, but did not estimate how long the men could live on a limited amount of air. <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said he did n't know what condition the crew quarters were in. The names of the dead were being withheld pending notification of their families, <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said. The search had to be abandoned Monday because of high seas and strong wind stirred up by <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, which had leased the rig and hired the rescue divers, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> sent vessels to resume the search Tuesday after <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> blew ashore in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and weakened to a tropical depression.

The technical name for the rig is a lift boat. It has retractable legs that anchor it to the sea bottom when in use, and raise out of the way to allow the rig to be floated to a new location.

 A leading Chinese intellectual, believed to be a key link between deposed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and the crushed student movement, has escaped to the West, an activist said Wednesday. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yizi </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> several weeks ago on an `` underground railroad,'' the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> activist said. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, about 50, was director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restructuring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, an influential think tank when <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was in power. While in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> participated in meetings to form an overseas organization to push for democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> did not meet journalists, nor were reporters informed of his presence in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Indeed, some Western reports said he had been arrested in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> activist, who insisted on anonymity, said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> remained in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but declined to reveal his whereabouts. There was no way to confirm the report by the activist, but he has been reliable in the past. Several weeks ago, an official at <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s institute said he was `` resting.'' So far, the activist said, about 30 people have fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> via the `` railroad.'' Among them have been essayist <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> and student leader <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, both of whom were in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>. They since have gone to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Others such as Marxist scholar <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by other means. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has said <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> authorities apparently wanted to use <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> to prove that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had direct ties to the student movement. His escape would complicate those efforts, the activist said. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> apparently met with student leaders during their two-month movement for sweeping political change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In a speech July 6, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> by name for presiding at a May 19 meeting during which pariticipants urged `` publicizing the inside story of the decision-making of the top leadership.'' On May 20, martial law was declared in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The movement was crushed on June 3 and 4 when thousands of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> soldiers entered the capital and killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed city residents and students. The Western diplomat said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities wanted to prove <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> conducted the meetings at the behest of <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s former right-hand man <PERSON> Bao </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> of the Political Structure, another pro-Zhao think-tank, was placed under house arrest shortly after the crackdown. If the link between <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> could be established, communist authorities would be able to implicate <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> directly in the student movement, the Western diplomat said. So far, the charges against <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> have been relatively vague. The former chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was officially purged after the June 4 crackdown and accused of supporting the movement and `` counterrevolutionary turmoil.'' More recently, the state-run media have accused him being responsible for high prices and widespread corruption. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s real involvement in the student movement is unclear. His sympathy for the movement was obvious when he went to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in mid-May and, with tears in his eyes, told the students that he had come to see them too late. The movement was supported by many intellectuals like <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yizhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> who worked in think-tanks tied to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. But it is unknown whether they were functioning under <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s orders or acting on their own. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> activist said he looked on <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s escape as a major victory against the current crackdown on the movement. Thousands of students and other participants in the campaign for freedom have been arrested since the repression began in early June. The official media, which started out reporting every major new arrest with headlines, have stopped highlighting such activity. The apparent arrest of student leader <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> received no mention in the Chinese press.

 Writers in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> said Wednesday the PEN branch was being allowed to reopen and <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> would be on the board, but reports from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said police had detained the prominent, banned playwright. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klima </PERSON>, a dissident writer, said in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> about 20 colleagues gathered on Tuesday and elected a new PEN governing board. <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said both he and <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> were on the panel, which also included authors sanctioned by <PERSON> Czechoslovia </PERSON>'s strict communist regime. <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> was banned after a Soviet-led invasion crushed the 1968 `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring'' of reforms. The Czech branch of the international writers' club became dormant around 1971 after purges of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, including many writers. Dissident sources and a <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was detained Wednesday while on his way to the embassy for lunch with Ambassador <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>. It was the second day in a row <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was picked up. Police detained him for about three hours Tuesday. Sources in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said by telephone they did not know whether <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was released later Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampe </PERSON> said his government considered the detention an `` extremely serious'' incident and had lodged a formal protest. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was sentenced to eight months in jail earlier this year, but released on parole about midway through the term after domestic and foreign protests. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said, police freed <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> in time for him to appear at the end of the meeting. He said police summoned two members of the human rights group Charter 77, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanturkova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simecka </PERSON>, for questioning at the same time as the meeting, so they were unable to attend. CTK, the official Czechoslovak news agency, reported the PEN reorganization briefly. <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said the 10 members of the new board included six dissident or nonconformist writers and four who were officially sanctioned. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> did not mentioned the board's makeup. <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mucha </PERSON>, an official writers, was elected board chairman in what <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> described as a compromise. Reviving the PEN chapter is the first joint official-dissident literary venture in almost 20 years. <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said he hoped the club could negotiate with authorities on publishing forbidden books and lifting bans on writers. Authorities have made small moves in the past year toward artistic liberalization. Books by <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> have appeared for only the second time since the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring'' and bans were removed from several movies, plays and rock bands. Officials say <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and some other writers have remained under prohibition because of their refusal to renounce political activities. In May, the 60-chapter international PEN association voted unanmously to admit a Soviet chapter, ending a long quarrel with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet participation in the 10,000-member group has been an issue since <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> turned down an application in 1924. PEN champions freedom of expression for writers and had stayed out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of its persecution of writers and other intellectuals. The change of heart came after <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> introduced more liberal policies.

 Thousands of firefighters struggled Wednesday to contain forest fires that killed two tourists in <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, forced the evacuation of thousands of people and destroyed dozens of homes on the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. The fires threatened some of the most popular vacation areas in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Flames shot up near the village of <LOCATION> Bormes-Les-Mimosas </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION>, forcing evacuation of a camping site. Firefighters used planes to dump water on that blaze. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the fires, fanned by the region's usually strong winds, have devastated about 50,000 acres of forest and brush land It said the winds had combined with drought to make the work of firefighters `` very difficult.'' The firefighters had been trying to stop advancing flames for three days, but the ministry said new fires were breaking out in many places. Two Italian tourists were killed Monday when they drove their car into a wall of fire in northern <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, an island off the French coast, officials said. Nearly 25,000 acres have burned there, the ministry said. Other fires were spreading along the coast of southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, especially around <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION>. More than 4,000 people were evacuated northwest of <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> and about 50 homes and cottages were destroyed. Fires also destroyed 62 miles of telephone cable and 1,000 poles, and up to 4,000 homes were without service, the telephone company said. Electricity of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said thousands of electric lines were cut Tuesday and Wednesday at an estimated damage of up to $ 795,000. Several people were detained for questioning in the Bouches-du-Rhone region around <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> as authorities tried to determine if arson played a role in the more than 100 separate fires. In <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, shepherds are widely suspected of setting fires to open land and improve next year's grazing. In <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION>, hundreds of firefighters aided by helicopters and aircraft battled wind-whipped brush fires that have killed four people. The fires have burned more than 2,500 acres of land in the island's <LOCATION> Sassari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. An Italian woman airlifted to a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> hospital died Wednesday. Another woman evacuated to the hospital Tuesday was reported in critical condition. Three others have died since the fires began Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> did n't win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approval to be civil rights chief because he failed a `` litmus test'' on discrimination issues. The attorney general said he discounted the significance of criticism by several Democrats that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> lacked expertise for the job, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lost Tuesday's vote because he refused to criticize recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions on civil rights. `` That was the reason expressed by one of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION> on the Democratic side,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` His reason for not supporting Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was that Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> supported the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions on civil rights,'' the attorney general said in an apparent reference to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. Civil rights lawyers have bemoaned the court decisions they say will make it harder for discrimination victims to win bias suits in court <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said `` Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> supported the views of the president and the attorney general in this regard'' when he testified that no legislation was needed at this time to overturn the rulings. `` I find it somewhat bizarre to expect an appointee of the president to begin his career in opposition to the president in an important area of the law,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` The fact that they have laid down as a litmus test that the prospective nominee must refuse to support <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions will make it difficult for us to walk the fine line that that view implies,'' the attorney general said. Before Tuesday's vote, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' support of the high court rulings during confirmation hearings as his reason for voting against the nomination. But other Democrats said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' lack of legal experience and knowledge of civil rights laws was the basis for their votes against the nomination. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' views on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings `` are not the test. But his answers were a symptom.'' `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is a fine person,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, `` but the chief civil rights enforcement officer of the land must have a firm grasp of the laws he oversees and a firm commitment to vigorously enforce those laws.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 61, a former sheriff and chief executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has never tried a court case. The panel refused Tuesday on a pair of 7-7 votes to recommend <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination or send it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for further consideration. The votes virtually killed <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' chances for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation but <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was considering the option of giving <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> a so-called recess appointment after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes out of session Friday. `` I think we are going to look at every option and consult with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' the attorney general told reporters after testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. Congressional and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say it is unlikely that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would antagonize the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by appointing <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to the job while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes its summer recess. Such an interim appointment would be in effect until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' adjournment in 1990. But presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` we are still assessing our options.'' An official said the administration is also considering whether to name <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to another post that does not require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> still has a pool of applicants for the job of assistant attorney general for civil rights from which <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' name was selected. `` Those will be re-evaluated in the light of his failure to get a vote on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The threat of a recess appointment could backfire. Under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, all nominations awaiting confirmation are sent back to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes into recess. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, however, traditionally waives this rule by unanimous consent of its members when the White House pledges not to make recess appointments. Without such a promise, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could send all 123 of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominations now pending on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> back to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and begin confirmation proceedings anew in September

 A <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet dragged its left wing and engine down a runway during an emergency landing Wednesday after part of its landing gear jammed, but none of the 100 people aboard was injured. `` I've had worse landings on regular flights,'' said passenger <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The left landing gear could not be lowered because of a wheel chock that had lodged in the landing gear bay, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. He said he did not know how or when the rubber chock, which is used to hold planes in place on the ground, might have been wedged there. A <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokesman said wheel chocks are supposed to be left on the ground. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that investigators believe mechanics at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> might have accidentally left the chock in the plane's landing gear well. Passengers praised the crew and the pilot, whom <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> refused to identify. `` It was kind of like a roller-coaster, kind of fun,'' said Army Sgt. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> McDorman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. She said the passengers were calm and the landing `` was just as smooth as if he was on wheels. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 carried 94 passengers and six crew, including the pilot, said <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>. Piedmont took delivery of the jetliner in December 1988 and has had no problems with it or with the 737-400 fleet in general, <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, but was diverted to <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> has a maintenance hangar, after a cockpit light showed the landing gear was n't locked, <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. The pilot `` circled for better than an hour in an attempt to get all the gear down,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. The pilot got the nose wheel and right landing gear down, but not the left gear, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. During maneuvers to shake loose the landing gear and use up fuel, the jetliner did a touch-and-go on one wheel _ contacting the runway before immediately taking off again. Finally, the plane was eased down to the ground near the beginning of the 10,000-foot runway. After the right main landing gear touched down, the left wing tilted slowly toward the ground, tapping it twice before the wing and its engine assembly dragged the runway. Emergency vehicles lined the runway after the airport was closed to other traffic. There was a brief flash of flame and smoke, apparently from a tire, and the plane slid in a straight line, coming to rest about a third of the way down the runway. Passengers slid down emergency chutes. Emergency crews sprayed foam on the wing and engine. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said she was moved from her seat, which was located on an emergency exit so that someone stronger could handle the door once the plane landed. `` They had prepared us with this brace procedure,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said, crossing her arms over her head to demonstrate the instructions. `` I braced and braced.'' Some passengers were still shaking and soaked in sweat after they were bused to the terminal from the runway. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, had but one comment when he emerged from the plane: `` Thank God.'' He said the pilot `` did a very beautiful job.'' `` I went to the pilot when we got off'' and flashed him a thumbs-up sign, said passenger <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON> said the pilot looked at him, then pointed to the sky. `` I think the crew deserves a tremendous amount of praise,'' said <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` It shows a tremendous amount of professionalism.'' She said the pilot had flown 20 years for <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which delivered the plane to <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> on Nov. 14, 1988, will not send a crash investigation team, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. On Saturday, the <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> name will disappear and all planes will bear <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> markings. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> have been subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> for two years.

<HEAD>Richardson to File $35 Million Suit For Being Jailed in Family Killings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> fruit picker who spent more than 21 years in prison for the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven children is filing a $ 35 million lawsuit for being wrongly convicted, his attorneys said Wednesday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was freed last April after a state investigation ordered by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> found that suppressed evidence and perjured testimony was used to convict the 53-year-old farm worker. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> stood trial only for the slaying of his oldest child and was sentenced to die in the electric chair. The sentence was commuted to life in prison when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the death penalty in 1972. Attorneys in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> were to file <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s suit Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. The lawsuit names the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> DeSoto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, former State Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> and former DeSoto Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>. The 22-page complaint includes five separate counts of constitutional and civil rights violations and racketeering activities on the part of <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s attorneys, conceded it was difficult placing a dollar amount on the time <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> spent in prison. `` It's hard. You ca n't really do it,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` He was without his family, loss of liberty and everything that's guaranteed to him by the constitution Those things were all stripped from him because of the actions of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>.'' The suit charges <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> furthered a conspiracy to convict <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> at all costs. `` They manufactured evidence, witnesses were threatened and they knowingly used perjured testimony to convict <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, who retired in January, prosecuted the case in 1968 and blasted Special Prosecutor <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> for concluding that <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> probably was wrongfully accused. Ms. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> announced in May that the state would not retry <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, whose sentence was vacated April 25. Neither <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> were immediately available for comment. The suit seeks to compensate <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> for mental anguish, loss of the capacity for the enjoyment of life, loss of income, pain and suffering and loss of his liberty and rights as a citizen of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since his release from a state prison near <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> has worked at a diet clinic run by former comedian <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was expected to comment on the suit at a news conference scheduled for Thursday in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was initially jailed on charges of poisoning his seven children to collect insurance money. Six of the children, ages 2 to 8, died Oct. 25, 1967, after eating a pesticide-laced lunch. The seventh child died the next day. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, were out in the orange groves at the time. The suit said <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> continued to pursue the insurance motive, even though the evidence showed that there had never been an insurance policy taken out. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> also suppressed all evidence implicating <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, a baby sitter who served the fatal lunch to the children, the suit charges. In recent years, Ms. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> confessed to the killings, but that confession was thrown out because she was ruled mentally incompetent. `` Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> manipulated the evidence to exonerate a murderer and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> conspired with him to do so from the beginning of the investigation and continues to do so to this day,'' according to the suit. Ms. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state attorney appointed by the governor to investigate the allegations, found evidence of trial errors and called the murder investigation `` totally inadequate and incomplete.''

<TEXT>
 An emotionally divided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday rejected an effort to tighten abortion restrictions in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the first congressional test on the subject since a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last month permitting states to impose new limits. On a surprising 219-206 vote that evoked hugs and hoots of cheer on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor by supporters of the right to abortion, the lawmakers rejected a proposal that would have banned all government spending on abortions in the capital. The vote was a reversal of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sentiment last year, when the legislators voted 222-186 to ban public spending on the procedures. Abortion activists said it was the first time since 1980 the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had refused to restrict government spending for abortion. The defeated provision, an amendment to a spending bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that forms <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s municipal budget, was proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>. The prohibition would have included cases in which the mother's life is in danger or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recessed for the day and left the vote on final passage of the overall bill for Thursday. That left anti-abortion lawmakers one more chance to find votes and try to salvage their proposal, perhaps by defeating the entire spending measure. Defeat of the amendment left intact abortion provisions in the bill which are more liberal than current law. The bill would allow the district to spend its own funds for abortions and to use federal funds if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest or if the mother's life was in danger. Current law, which expires Sept. 30, contains a ban on spending either federal or district funds unless the mother's life is threatened. Quoting the hospitalized Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., one of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s foremost abortion opponents, <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said, `` This is not government intervention The government's first duty is to protect the weak from the strong.'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> and his supporters said they preferred to include an exception for mothers whose lives are threatened, but did not because it would have left their amendment vulnerable to being struck down for procedural reasons. Opponents to <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>'s language warned that the roll call would supply a hit list of lawmakers for voters who support the freedom to choose abortions. `` All across the country, a newly energized pro-choice movement is going to say to supporters of amendments like this, ` If you are anti-choice, when we the voters go to the ballot box, we wo n't choose you,''' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., said before the Jubilant pro-choice lawmakers readily conceded that they had not expected to win, but attributed the surprise victory to a new alarm among voters triggered by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s recent decision restricting women's constitutional right to abortion. After the vote, <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> said: `` It was clear to members that this is an issue on which they're going to be held accountable. This vote was a dramatic turn, and it clearly reflects what's happening in the country. It's a sea change.'' The court's decision `` was really a wake-up call'' to abortion defenders, said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo. House members `` must be starting to hear from people back home. `` This is a barometer,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` The winds are blowing, and they're blowing in our direction. <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> blamed his defeat on the new attention the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling has brought to abortion, the election of several freshmen who favor liberalized abortion laws, and a reluctance by some lawmakers to vote for a measure containing no exception for endangered mothers. He noted that earlier Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had overwhelmingly approved a separate spending bill that barred the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> from providing any funds for abortions, except for instances when the woman's life is at stake. `` I'm not worried about losing anything else,'' he said. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION> and a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, was elated. `` We're on a roll. Thirty-three votes switched since 1980. ... We've marched in the streets, surged in the polls and challenged both parties,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said. On July 3, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gave states greater powers to restrict abortions, allowing them to ban public employees or facilities from participating in abortions, even when patients are willing to pay for them.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved a $ 295 billion defense bill that leaves President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategic programs such as Star Wars and the B-2 bomber relatively intact, but backs an aircraft <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to kill. `` The basic goals of the president was met,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, prior to final passage of the legislation. By a vote of 95-4, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved its version of the defense authorization bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ a blueprint that bears no resemblance to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation that gutted or severely cut the president's big-ticket weapons systems. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill endorses the president's two mobile-missile plan, including the request of $ 1.1 billion for the MX rail-garrison and $ 100 million for the Midgetman. The legislation also makes a modest cut of $ 400 million in the $ 4.9 billion request for Star Wars and trims $ 300 million from the $ 4.7 billion proposal for the B-2 stealth bomber. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> backed the costly bomber, priced at $ 530 million a copy, if it meets flight test and radar-evasion standards, and accepted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to cancel the F-14D Tomcat jet fighter. But the chamber diverged from the president on the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor assault transport that takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 255 million in research and development for the Bell-Boeing aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> meet in conference in early September to complete a final version of the two defense blueprints the chambers have crafted. The final product will include $ 295 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, plus $ 10 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have more profound differences this year than we've had in a long, long time,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` We face a difficult conference with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on this bill.'' The money still has to be dispersed through appropriations bills. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> slashed $ 1.8 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> request, limited production of the B-2 bomber to two planes next year and two the year after that _ half what the administration sought, required the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to come up with a program cheaper than $ 70 billion for the planned 132 planes and cut $ 502 million from the MX missile. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also eliminated all $ 100 million for the Midgetman and restored the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D jet fighter, the two planes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed canceling. Overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the bill was not without some dissent. `` Our motto ought to be: In Bombs We Trust. That's our national ethic _ that is the example we are setting _ here on this floor,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Republican who entered <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War and was one of the first serviceman on the scene after the atom bomb was dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>. Voting against were Sens. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D.; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., did not vote In other developments on the bill, which kept lawmakers will past midnight on Wednesday and then throughout the day, senators: _ Approved by voice vote a non-binding resolution urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to continue development of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft the administration sought to cancel The defense bill includes $ 255 million for research and development of the Bell-Boeing V-22, which takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane. _ By voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., requiring graduates of the nation's military academies to serve six years of service after graduation rather than the eight years the bill would have The current requirement is five years. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> argued that the eight-year requirement would drive applicants away from the academies. The effort to table the amendment failed 55-45 prior to the voice vote. There is no comparable provision in the House version of the bill. _ Accepted by voice vote a non-binding resolution instructing the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to report by Sept. 1 on how best to locate and rescue American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The report must detail how additional money and agents can be used to find the hostages and win their release. _ Voted 53-44 against a plan to spend $ 100 million for the effective deployment of 100 ground-based interceptor missiles in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, by 1995 The interceptors, part of the Accidental Launch Protection System, would have been used against sudden terrorist missile attacks. _ Approved a series of `` burden-sharing'' amendments aimed at increasing the contributions to defense by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> _ Declined to vote on a proposal to restore former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s $ 23,000 pension North has been convicted on three felony counts in the Iran-Contra affair, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ordered its <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to hold hearings on the subject of his pension. The defense bill legislation contains $ 200 million for anti-satellite weapons in addition to unspecified amounts in the Star Wars budget. Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., had proposed restrictions to bar such tests unless the administration could certify that the Soviets had engaged in tests of their own, had refused to bargain in good faith in limitations and had blocked international verification The efforts to block attempts to chip away at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s defense package were evident earlier this morning when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> avoided a vote on an amendment transferring $ 450 million from the administration's $ 4.9 billion request for the Star Wars anti-missile shield to the war on drugs. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a compromise drafted by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, that would shift unspent balances in federal programs left over at the end of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 to the anti-drug effort The measure exempts entitlement programs, including Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, and subsidized housing. But all other government programs and agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, would be compelled to contribute. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has sought to avoid following the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lead in gutting or severely cutting back <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategic programs. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to cut $ 1.8 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, impose strict limitations on the B-2 stealth bomber, slash $ 502 million from the $ 1.1 billion request for the MX nuclear missile and eliminate all $ 100 million for the Midgetman missile. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> meet in conference in early September to complete a final version of the two defense blueprints the chambers have crafted.

 Security agents detained opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> on Wednesday and released him 22 hours later after questioning on whether he was involved in a lawmaker's secret trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Following his release Thursday, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told a news conference that he was cleared of any suspicion. Clashes occurred Wednesday near the police station where he was held when about 100 <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> supporters were stopped by hundreds of riot police. Two of the protesters were injured. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> had questioned <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, and lawmaker <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong-hwan </PERSON> after taking him from his party headquarters to the downtown police station. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was also released, but there were no reports he spoke about his investigation. Government officials said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> was investigated to determine whether he was involved in an unauthorized trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON>, a former party lawmaker jailed on charges of espionage and security violations. The government prohibits any unofficial contacts with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who ran twice for the presidency, has denied any involvement in <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s trip and charged the government with political harassment. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was expelled from the party after his June 28 arrest on charges of espionage for allegedly accepting $ 120,000 from communist agents. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, the other lawmaker questioned, is a senior party member and younger brother of Presbyterian minister <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, a dissident clergyman who also defied the travel ban and visited <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The elder <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> is in jail. Hundreds of party members and supporters chanted <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s name and anti-government slogans when intelligence agents took <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> away Wednesday. Shouting `` Disband the <ORGANIZATION> NSP </ORGANIZATION>!'' in reference to the national security agency, they marched around their party headquarters and briefly stopped the agents. The opposition leader smiled and waved as he left in his car. Party spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-soo </PERSON> said that with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s detention, the national security agency's `` scheme to suppress and destroy the party has reached the extreme.'' The intelligence agency earlier said it wanted to question <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> about how <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, a dissident farmer, joined the opposition party and gained access to the opposition leader. At least 10 people have been jailed since <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s arrest. In another development, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news reports said a visiting South Korean student has ended a five-day hunger strike she staged after the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Command guarding the border said they would not let her return through the border village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. Im Su-kyong vowed to cross the border Aug. 15 in a demonstration for unification and asked the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government and the U.S.-led <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Command to allow her safe passage. South Korean officials have said she will be arrested on her return. `` I consider that the hunger strike ended in a great victory,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Miss Im as saying. `` I will wage a struggle ... for my return home.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> has not blocked the student's return home, but said they would consider an unauthorized crossing of the border a violation of the armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War. Miss Im visited <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to attend the July 1-8 World Festival of Youth and Students. She then joined a march from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paekdu </LOCATION>, at the northern end of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, to the border village. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was divided in 1945 after World War II. The 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> fought on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s side in the Korean War.

 The federal government is investigating allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> overcharged and double-billed the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> millions of dollars for repairs of buildings leased for secret military work. The investigation by two defense agencies, a congressional panel, and reportedly, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, was sparked by a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> electrical engineer and inspector, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who was fired Friday. But it has gone beyond his allegations, said an investigator for a congressman looking into the case. The investigation appears to have started with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s lease of buildings under government contract from millionaire <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabey </PERSON>, according to an internal <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> memorandum obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The buildings were built to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s specifications by <PERSON> Sabey </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> says three buildings at one office park were substandard and required $ 3 million in electrical and other repairs and improvements, and that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> billed the government for the work, rather than <PERSON> Sabey </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> confirmed Tuesday that an investigation was underway and read a statement: `` Mr. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> noted some items that he concluded did not meet building and electrical codes. The items he noted were thoroughly investigated by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and corrective actions were taken where appropriate. Additionally, the buildings were inspected and approved by the appropriate local government agencies.'' <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s director of public relations, declined further comment on the investigation and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s firing. <PERSON> Sabey </PERSON> was unavailable, his secretary said. <ORGANIZATION> Sabey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdick </PERSON> said the firm would have no comment. The leases with <PERSON> Sabey </PERSON> include buildings at two office parks used by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> for military work. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> division has defense contracts and subcontracts that range from work on the B-2 stealth bomber to guided missile systems and avionic research. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> contends he was fired for alerting federal officials to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> billing the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the repairs at the Oxbow office park. He says <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> ignored his early warnings that electrical work in the buildings was substandard. In a July 18 letter to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> contended he was `` effectively quieted by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> management'' and `` I have not been able to intelligently and satisfactorily discuss with supervisors the substandard workmanship.'' <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON>'s secretary said her boss would not comment. `` People in management have been covering up,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> asserted Tuesday. `` Not one man in that whole group had the courage to stand up and tell <PERSON> Sabey </PERSON> the buildings were substandard. Instead, they said ` let the taxpayer pay for it.''' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he has given investigators stacks of records over the past year, some copies of which he gave to the AP when he learned he was to be fired, including blueprints and other documents he contended reveal substandard electrical work that `` clearly violated not only <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s specifications of what they wanted in the Oxbow buildings, but national and state electrical and building codes.'' The internal memo, from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> attorney S.W. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> to department heads, describes the scope of a recent <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> subpoena of company records. Most of the materials subpoenaed, ranging from `` leasehold improvements, repair and maintenance'' to internal company audits of leases, refer specifically to the <ORGANIZATION> Sabey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> admonished officials to destroy nothing that might relate to the subpoena Investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> began in mid-1988 with allegations from <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also is investigating, although Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> declined to confirm that, as a matter of policy. An investigator for Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., said <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also is looking into <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> The staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating. Air Force Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinnell </PERSON>, spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigations office, said: `` I can confirm that we do have an ongoing investigation concerning mischarging of facility repair costs for leased buildings. By mischarging, we mean overcharging, double-billing.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said that when <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> went to repair some of the problems, it had to `` fix some of them a second or third time. I'm told by the AFOSI that the taxpayers pay for all of these repairs, not <PERSON> Sabey </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> Grinnell </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, both declined to discuss <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s specific allegations or other elements of their investigations But <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s staff investigator said: `` From our standpoint, the <ORGANIZATION> DCAA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION> appear to be making substantial progress. From what they've told us, -LRB- <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s -RRB- allegations all appear to have merit.'' The agencies and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` are looking at mischarging, overcharging, double-billing.'' And he said that while <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was `` the catalyst'' for the investigation, it has gone beyond his allegations. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he plans to sue under a federal statute that provides whistleblowers a portion of settlements if the allegations are proved.

<HEAD>Court Rules Rented Houses Can Be Destroyed, 13 Wounded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday that the army can destroy the homes of Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activities even if they are rented. The decision followed by just four days a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that said the army must give Palestinians an opportunity to appeal before destroying their homes. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 13 Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops, hospitals reported. A Palestinian prisoner, <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Imadi </PERSON>, was seriously beaten by fellow inmates at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> detention center in the southern <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert, the army said. It said it was investigating the circumstances of the incident. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling came in response to a case brought by an Arab landlord in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, the independent <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The landlord, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumail </PERSON>, said he rented an apartment to <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, who has been charged with throwing Molotov cocktails at an army vehicle and at the house of a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jumail </PERSON> said that even though he had no connection with <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>'s alleged activities, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had ordered his property destroyed <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamgar </PERSON>, the court president, ruled that if sanctions could not be taken against rental property, it would `` negate all the deterrent power that comes from the usage of the emergency defense regulations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said. He said, however, that <PERSON> Jumail </PERSON>'s property should be sealed and not destroyed. Israeli forces have blown up or torn down at least 225 houses in the occupied territories since the start of the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule 19 months ago. At least 527 Palestinians and 38 Israelis have died in the uprising. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and international human rights groups have called for an end to the practice, saying that it is carried out without due process of the law. In many cases, property is destroyed before the suspect is either charged or tried.

<TEXT>
 Pink scallops contaminated with a potentially deadly, natural poison were shipped to restaurants because of the time it took to process tests on the shellfish, officials said Wednesday. Shellfish tested contained more than five times the level of the poison permitted by state regulations, said state health department spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. All but 7 pounds of the 75 pounds of scallops in the shipment from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state had been accounted for by late Wednesday, according to state health officials. Officials were trying to determine whether diners had eaten any of the scallops, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> August </PERSON>, another health department spokesman. August said there had been no reports of poisonings, and noted that the poison is relatively fast-acting. The distributor, <PERSON> Marinelli </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, recovered 35 pounds of the shipment, and advised four <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-area </LOCATION> restaurants that received a total of 25 pounds to destroy the scallops, said <PERSON> Marinelli </PERSON>'s general manager <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. An additional 15 pounds were sent to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> restaurateur, who also was told to destroy the shellfish, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Another 75-pound shipment of scallops gathered from the same area but at a different time was shipped to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but was found to be uncontaminated, health officials said. All commercial shellfishing in northern Puget Sound was suspended until <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state can analyze the situation, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilja </PERSON>, shellfish program manager for that state's health department. The pink scallop is a gourmet item typically sold only to restaurants, although some markets occasionally carry it, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. Health investigators identified the poison as saxitoxin, a natural substance that does not harm shellfish but causes paralysis and sometimes death in humans. The shipment from <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oysters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, arrived and was tested at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Monday. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> health inspectors routinely test scallops every two weeks, but `` apparently this particular lot slipped through,'' said <PERSON> Lilja </PERSON>. It takes 24 hours to process the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tests, and the scallops were transferred to <PERSON> Marinelli </PERSON>'s pending the results, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. By the time the contamination was reported late Tuesday afternoon, they had already been shipped. `` You're dealing with a live product,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` There are economic factors at work, too.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nava </PERSON>, chief of field operations for the food and drug branch of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> health department, could not say why incoming shellfish are not held during the 24-hour processing period. `` I do n't have an answer for that, except that 99 percent of the time they're OK, they're great,'' <PERSON> Nava </PERSON> said. `` It works fine.'' Officials must balance public health considerations with the danger of causing `` unnecessary panic,'' he said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials are reviewing their testing policies and are waiting to see if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> authorities change their procedures, <PERSON> Nava </PERSON> said. Saxitoxin is a potent poison that can cause paralysis and even death, according to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> health department. It is picked up by shellfish feeding on a `` red tide'' made up of microorganisms. Cooking will not destroy the toxin and concentrations of about 1,000 micrograms per 3 -LCB- - ounce serving have caused serious problems for people, according to <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>, a specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> The sample gathered Monday contained the equivalent of about 470 micrograms per 3 -LCB- ounces, Woo said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinelli </PERSON> of <PERSON> Marinelli </PERSON>'s Seafood disputed the warning that the shellfish could be deadly. The toxin levels were `` not safe, but by no means lethal,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Diesel fuel spilled into <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> by a train derailment began washing up on beaches and shores near this resort community Wednesday and residents complained that the cleanup effort was halfhearted. Gov. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> toured the site by helicopter and said <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern Railroad would be held accountable for `` anything that's been adversely impacted that has a cost to it,'' as well as all cleanup costs. BN Vice President <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said the railroad would pay all costs `` legally that we need to.'' BN continued to pump diesel oil remaining in tanker cars that landed in the lake, but said all leaks had been plugged by divers and no more oil was spilling. The railroad estimated 10,000 gallons had spilled since Monday's derailment. Twenty-nine cars of a 100-car train derailed Monday four miles north of <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and several cars, including the fuel-carrying tankers, went down a 100-foot embankment into <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> estimated the cost of the derailment alone at $ 557,000, but said he has no estimate on cleanup costs. A helicopter survey Wednesday revealed that about half the 3,350-acre lake was covered with the telltale rainbow sheen of a thin oil slick, and oil began washing ashore on the populated southern and eastern banks. `` It's awful,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Olafson </PERSON>, who lives on the eastern shore. `` We've been mopping all morning and the winds changed and now it's just come back in again.'' <PERSON> Olafson </PERSON> complained that there had been too little response to the spill. `` The way they react is just wrong,'' <PERSON> Olafson </PERSON> said. `` They're always looking for the cheap way out, and it ends up being more expensive. The governor said he was `` deeply saddened'' by the sight, noting he and his family have vacationed at the lake for years. The tank cars should be pulled out of the water sometime Thursday, said <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Melonas </PERSON>, BN's <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> spokesman. The derailment closed BN's main line from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, forcing freight trains to be rerouted south, and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> had to bus passengers from its Empire Builder train around the derailment area.

<TEXT>
 A congressman Wednesday questioned how the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues travel advisories, saying a warning should have been posted for <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> before a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman became the latest tourist killed in a recent string of ambushes. `` While the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did respond the following day by placing <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> on the travel advisory list, I must seriously question why this action was not taken earlier,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., said in a letter to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> Three German tourists were wounded in an ambush in April, two French tourists were killed by ivory poachers in early July and two Americans were beaten while riding horseback last week, <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. `` It is my understanding that incidents such as the above weigh heaviest in any decision to place a nation on the travel advisory list,'' the congressman said. `` American citizens deserve to be informed of any dangers they face as international travelers.'' An advisory for <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> was not issued until after <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was shot to death last Thursday by two bandits armed with assault rifles who fired at a van carrying a <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> wildlife tour group. `` My saddness and concern stem from this tragic loss of life and the possibility that proper risk notification was not given,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. The congressman requested a detailed explanation of the decision-making process for travel advisories and urged an `` in-depth review'' by the department of its procedures. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> referred to a March press release that read in part, `` Travel advisories which describe a potential for violence and physical danger usually reflect a trend or pattern of violence over a period of time in which the government of the country involved is unwilling or unable to afford normal protection.''

<HEAD>Student Expelled for Leading University Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Chinese student who helped stage a demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> last month has been expelled and refused his diploma, university officials said. A public announcement, posted on bulletin boards once festooned with the posters of the student-led pro-democracy movement, said <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayong </PERSON>, 22, had broken martial law regulations banning unauthorized gatherings. The notice, dated July 25, said <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON>, a fourth-year student of Chinese and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, had `` incited other students to cause trouble by breaking martial law restrictions.'' It also accused <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON> of being a `` known criminal'' who had stolen three bicycles this summer and caused a drunken brawl last year. With no diploma and an expulsion on his record, <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON> will have difficulty finding work. On July 23, from 300 to 400 students sang and beat pots and pans to mourn classmates killed June 3-4 when troops opened fire on student protesters and supporters. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said 200-300 people died in the military assault, but Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. The students said they held the July 23 demonstration because they felt oppressed by the ideological study classes they were forced to attend following the military crackdown. They were also protesting because some of them were refused permission to join the work units to which they were earlier assigned. Most college graduates in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are assigned jobs by the government. Most of the 32,000 graduates from 80 universities and colleges in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this year have been accepted by their assigned units, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Wednesday. The report said more than 1,000 graduates, however, had not found appropriate jobs, in part because some foreign companies, party schools, judicial departments, travel agencies and the military had dropped plans to accept more than 300 students. The report did not say whether the refusals were due to political considerations arising from participation in the pro-democracy demonstrations this spring, which were initiated and led by students from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities. It quoted <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueping </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, as saying that all graduates in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had undergone three weeks of political study to review their thought and actions during the student protests.

 Government investigators told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday they have uncovered an additional $ 1.2 million in payments to well-connected consultants who helped their employers win big <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contracts on housing for the poor. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, inspector general at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said known consultant fees now total more than $ 5.7 million for a single housing rehabilitation program. He said about one-fifth of all low-income apartment rehabilitations were snared by companies employing 20 consultants. The consultants include politically influential Republicans and former agency officials. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel heard the testimony as a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted 6-0 to subpoena <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to testify in September. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a former executive assistant to then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, failed to appear voluntarily last week to discuss allegations of abuse and mismanagement at the agency, saying his attorney was ill. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal spilled over onto the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the agency had been `` used as a political slush fund where political appointees gave favors ... to politically well-connected individuals'' during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> countered that the Democratic majority was stalling efforts by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to clean up the department by delaying confirmation votes on several key appointees. `` Let's make certain we understand that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has n't been very cooperative,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Now we've got a situation where Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is trying to do the right thing, and he does n't have anybody on board.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 17-0 Wednesday to recommend approval of the nomination of <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> as Assistant Secretary of Housing and it was approved by unanimous consent by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' report to the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> included several familiar names of consultants who received large fees. They included <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official who received nearly $ 1.7 million in fees; former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, who received $ 300,000; former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary and current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, who received $ 138,445, and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a former agency undersecretary who got $ 100,000. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said, `` In some of the earlier hearings we identified the rats, now we're starting to identify the cheese that attracted these rats. Much of the profit that developers made from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs were derived from tax credits and rent subsidies for apartments in areas where housing demand was weakening. The profits were used to pay millions of dollars in consultant fees on projects in a handful of states that should n't have gotten such projects because they had `` weak or very weak'' rental markets, according to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and other analysts. `` Multiple benefits were awarded to eligible projects by different administering agencies such as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, state tax credit allocation agencies and local governments,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ols </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> director of housing and community development issues of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found developers received between $ 250,000 and $ 2.1 million above their purchase and renovation costs in its review of eight projects in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s troubled moderate rehabilitation programs, he said. `` This is the profit of the developer less any income taxes he would have to pay,'' said Ols. <PERSON> Ols </PERSON> said excessive government rent subsidies for those projects could amount to $ 25 million over the 15-year period of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rental subsidy contracts. In an update of his April audit of the moderate rehabilitation program, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told the panel 20 consultants were paid more than $ 5.7 million for lobbying for 51 projects. Those projects covered 7,268 rental units, or 20.3 percent of the moderate rehabilitation funding available since 1983, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. In addition, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> found many of the projects concentrated in four states _ <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> _ which received more funds than they would have if they had been distributed using the `` fair share'' formula that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had waived. `` The bottom line is that the mod rehab program probably was not needed in these states during that time period,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The rental markets at the time these projects were approved were either `` weak or very weak'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schussheim </PERSON>, a housing specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schussheim </PERSON> examined 20 projects funded by the mod rehab program whose mortgages were originated by the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> under the federal coinsured mortgage program. <PERSON> Schussheim </PERSON> told the committee he could not determine if developers sought situations where properties could be bought at comparatively low prices because the market was `` soft'' but said it was a `` plausible hypothesis.'' Ols said the soft markets provided developers opportunity to convert available future tax credits on the projects to ready cash by selling to investors through syndicators.

 Thousands of people gathered in <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, Wednesday to condemn the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of their homeland in a secret pact between <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, an activist said. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION> that demonstrators demanded that the Soviet government declare the August 1939 pact to be null. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> legislative commission is thought to be within days of declaring void the agreement that divided Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before World War II into Soviet and German spheres of influence. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had denied for years that any such pact existed. Activists in the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> have pushed for such a decision for more than two years. <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> also came under Soviet control because of the pact. <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Moldavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said that between 2,000 and 3,000 people gathered in central <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION> to mark Wednesday's 49th anniversary of the Moldavian Soviet republic. Soviet soldiers occupied the small republic bordering <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on June 28, 1940. <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was told that members of <LOCATION> Vatra </LOCATION>, a group promoting Moldavian culture, were beaten by police when they tried to gather in <LOCATION> Bendery </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>. Demonstrations have swept the republic this year as ethnic Moldavians, who are closely related to Romanians, demand restoration of the Latin alphabet and their native language. The language was converted to Russian letters after the Soviet takeover. The republic's Supreme Soviet, or legislature, is to meet Aug. 28 to consider a law that would make Moldavian the official language.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Legislation to Aid Drought-Stricken Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a disaster assistance bill Wednesday to send $ 885 million in relief to farmers hit by drought and severe weather. The bill would make farmers eligible for federal aid if they have crop losses this year because of drought, flooding, freezing, hail, high winds or similar severe weather. The measure also provides for payments to livestock producers facing drought-related feed and water shortages for their herds. But the pricetag on the bill passed by voice vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is about $ 463 million less than the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated would be the cost of a packaged approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill provides for different eligibility standards for various crops, but in all cases producers would receive payments designed to cover 65 percent of their lost income from crop losses. In most cases, the projected income levels will be based on federal crop subsidies or average market prices farmers would have received had they not suffered losses. `` The most important thing about this bill is that all farmers are being treated fairly,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Those who suffer a significant loss will receive the same payment rate _ 65 percent of the applicable target price or loan rate.'' `` We will not discriminate against any farmer who needs help,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` This legislation treats farmers fairly, whether they grow wheat, corn, hay or soybeans.'' Wheat and other crops have been damaged by the lingering drought across much of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and flooding has destroyed rice and cotton in the South. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said winter wheat producers and other growers will be eligible for high-priority attention under provisions of the legislation `` This is not the best bill, nor is it the kind of relief winter wheat producers and other program crops deserve,'' he said. `` But it is far better than the budget-busting <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill which promised federal relief to every crop in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The House disaster relief bill required a minimum loss of 35 percent for any crop to receive assistance, with payments covering 65 percent of lost income. But unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure called for 90 percent payments on crop losses of more than 75 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dropped the higher payment level as a way of cutting the overall cost of the assistance package. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also passed by voice vote rural development legislation designed to promote business investment and expansion in small towns. It also is aimed at improving schools and health care for residents. Proponents had said federal assistance was needed because the 61 million people living in rural areas face higher unemployment, more hospital closings and higher poverty levels than their urban counterparts. The rural economy also is more volatile because of its dependence on natural resources, supporters contended. The centerpiece of the package, called the `` rural partnership act,'' is a revolving loan fund program to provide $ 300 million in seed money over five years for new and expanding businesses. The federal money, which must be matched by money from local sources, would go for loans and loan guarantees to create new jobs. The revolving loan funds would be operated by states, local governor or economic development groupst to ensure local control of the lending, according to supportrs.

<HEAD>Oil, Gas Industry Spar Over Effects On Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study paid for by oil interests concluded Wednesday that natural gas heat might contribute more to the `` greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth than oil heat. The gas industry immediately attacked the report as flawed and biased. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an oil industry group based in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, commissioned <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> to compare the two fuels. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, a physicist, is a public policy professor at the university's <ORGANIZATION> Humbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humphrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and co-chairman of the school's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>. He edited and was a co-author of `` The Challenge of Global Warming,'' a book sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group. He serves on the council's board of trustees. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON>, vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group representing pipeline companies, said the study `` is clearly biased towards oil. It is obvious who is paying for this study.'' <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, at a news conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, defended the independence of his study. `` The Oil Task Force put absolute no constraints'' on the study, he said. Scientists believe several gases allow warmth from the sun to pass through to the earth's surface, but block outgoing radiation, raising the planet's temperature in the same way a greenhouse stays warm. The chief contributor, accounting for about half the predicted future warming, is carbon dioxide, an inevitable product of combustion of any carbon-containing fuel. Methane is another such gas, and natural gas is almost all methane. For equivalent heat output, it has long been known that oil produces about 40 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas. The study said global warming from natural gas heat would exceed the global heating from oil heat if 1 percent to 2 percent of the natural gas is lost. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> said he found that 0.13 percent of the gas is lost in production and 0.54 percent is reported `` unaccounted for'' in interstate transmission. Distribution companies report 1 percent to 6 percent `` unaccounted for,'' and that does not count any that escapes after passing through the customer's meter. But the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the unaccounted for gas in all utilities includes gas theft, meter inaccuracies and other factors in addition to leaks. The gas association estimated that about 0.4 percent of the gas is lost in leaks. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> said methane causes 30 to 70 times more greenhouse heating than the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide, while gas industry representatives said it caused only 10 percent to 30 percent as much. The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> criticized the study for not taking into account the length of time the two gases will stay in the atmosphere. Methane remains in the air for 10 years, while carbon dioxide remains for 500 years, <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON> said. `` He assumes it is not worth considering. I think the effect is very signficiant,'' <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirpak </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official who has conducted studies of the greenhouse effect for the agency, said methane was 20 times more effective, molecule for molecule, in trapping radiation than was carbon dioxide, but its lifetime in the atmosphere is also important _ eight to 11 years vs. 100 to 500 years. As to gas being a bigger contributor than oil if 1 per cent to 2 percent is lost, <PERSON> Tirpak </PERSON> said, `` I think you'd have to go higher than than but I ca n't really say without having studied their statements.'' Methane concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing at about 1 percent per year and no one has determined why, though there are several theories. Some studies suggest that methane could be responsible for 20 percent of recent greenhouse warming, if there has been any, vs. about 50 percent for carbon dioxide.

 The man accused of killing `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'' star <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> was once thrown out of the TV studio where she was working after a guard noticed `` something haywire'' about him, the guard said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>, 19, came to the studio lot two years ago with a teddy bear and a bouquet, and begged to see the actress, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egger </PERSON>, chief of security for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> said he took <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> off the lot and drove him to the run-down motel in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> where the youth was staying. He said <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> promised to return home to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> called him the next day to say he was about to board a bus going there. `` I thought he was just lovesick, which I think he was,'' <PERSON> Egger </PERSON>, 62, said this week. `` He was terribly insistent on being let in. ` <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>' was every other word. ` I got ta see her. I love her. If I could just see her for a minute.' `` He seemed to be an intelligent kid, no raving lunatic, no dumbbell, but something was definitely wrong, mentally,'' <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> said. `` There was something haywire going on, but I did n't perceive it as potentially violent.'' <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> initially made numerous phone calls to the production office asking to speak to Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>. The incident provided another glimpse into what authorities call <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>'s fatal obsession with the 21-year-old actress, who was shot July 18 as she opened the door to her apartment building. <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> the next day and charged in the slaying. <PERSON> Egger </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> police captain, said he followed standard procedure in informing Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s production unit about <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>'s attempt to see her in June 1987. But whether anyone told Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> remained unclear Wednesday. `` So a fan tried to get on the lot. So what? Who's going to think he's a potential murderer?'' asked <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, vice president of the production company for `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.'' `` It would have seemed harmless: another young kid who's star-struck,'' she said `` We have tons of those. Lots are lovable; some are crazy. But who's to know?'' People who were present remember hearing about a persistent fan trying to gain access to the set but were unsure whether Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> was told.

<TEXT>
 A federal grand jury Wednesday indicted 46 traders at the world's two largest commodity exchanges on charges ranging from tax fraud to racketeering for allegedly bilking profits from hundreds of customers. The 2 -LCB- - year federal investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> resulted in allegations that traders systematically conspired with one another to skim profits from customers' accounts, and often tried to hide the profits from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Sixteen of the traders were charged with violating the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, which empowers the government to freeze defendants' assets before a trial for seizure upon conviction. The government increasingly has been using the law _ enacted to fight organized crime such as drug trafficking _ to crack down on securities crime and other white-collar corruption. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who attended the news conference at which the indictments were announced, said the charges were part of a `` crackdown on white-collar crime in all its various guises, from Wall Street to LaSalle Street to Main Street and all stops in between.'' LaSalle Street is the heart of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s financial district. `` The activity uncovered at these exchanges _ the largest of their type in the world _ can not be tolerated,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said traders broke the law and the rules governing business at the exchange by arranging deals with one another before and after the pits were open for trading. He said the alleged activity involved hundreds of customers and thousands of trades. No dollar amount was given for the alleged fraud but <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said it was `` significant.'' Officials said the investigation was continuing and indicated more indictments were possible. The charges, contained in four indictments totaling 375 pages, included hundreds of counts against the 46 people named. Nineteen indictments were returned for activities in the soybean pits and three in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond pits at the Board of Trade. At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, 21 indictments were in the Japanese yen pits and three each in Swiss franc pits. The government said directors of the Board of Trade and the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were not involved in the illegal activity and had cooperated in the investigation. `` The legitimate activities of these exchanges, involving everything from grains to government bonds and foreign currencies, impact upon farmers, consumers, businesses and governments,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who was joined by <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> at the news conference. `` I want to assure all parties that public confidence in the honest functioning of the marketplace will be vigorously protected,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> added. Sessions said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> used `` extraordinary means to detect extraordinary fraud,'' training agents in the complicated world of futures trading and sending them onto the exchange floors to mingle with real traders. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said the illegal schemes involved pre-arranged trades at prices below what the traders' customers actually paid for a commodity. The traders involved would then share the illegal profit, he said. At the close of business, traders frequently agreed among themselves to change prices on their cards to increase their profits and correct bad deals, the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> cited specific instances during the summer of 1988 _ when soybean prices were rising rapidly because of the drought _ where brokers routinely withheld orders from the market and then gave them to favored traders, cheating the customer out of a fair market price. `` What we are talking about here are hundreds of customers involving thousands of trades for which fraud was perpetrated and losses incurred by those customers because of this scheme,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation, disclosed in January, also centered on allegations that brokers sent false reports to customers to hide the skimming of profits or overcharges on commissions. The <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> also reportedly is planning to bring its own charges against four traders in connection with yen-pit trades with one of the undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who posed as traders in the federal investigation. Traders have been bargaining with authorities and the exchanges to reduce the possible penalties against them. Futures are contracts to buy or sell, by a future date at a specified price, commodities and financial instruments ranging from soybeans and pork bellies to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds and baskets of stocks. Futures traders can make and lose fortunes within minutes while standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the pits and trading with each other. Independent traders, called `` locals,'' trade for their own accounts. Other traders, called brokers, trade on behalf of clients of futures brokerages. Some brokers also trade for their own accounts in an often-criticized practice called dual trading. The government won a key battle clearing the way for the indictments on Friday when Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> denied a Swiss franc trader's contention that the government's secret taping of traders on the exchange floors had violated federal electronic surveillance laws

 A federal court jury Wednesday awarded $ 50 million to the families of 137 passengers killed when a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> plane strayed into Soviet territory and was shot down six years ago. All 269 people aboard were killed in the Sept. 1, 1983 disaster. The jury of three men and three women decided on punitive damages two hours after returning a verdict that <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> had committed willful misconduct. The jury concluded that actions by <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>'s crew aboard Flight 007 were a cause of the aircraft's destruction by a missile-firing Soviet fighter plane. Several family members clapped their hands when the finding of willful misconduct was announced, and one woman in the front row wept. The $ 50 million punitive damages, if upheld, will be shared equally by the 137 families. About two-thirds of the families who sued are American, the rest various other nationalities. Families of victims who did not sue get no share. Without the finding of willful misconduct, the families would have been limited to compensation of $ 75,000 per passenger, a figure set by international treaty. With the finding, the families are free to seek individual damages for such things as lost earnings of a parent or spouse in individual lawsuits in federal courts around the country. One hundred thirty-seven such lawsuits were consolidated into one case in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the case decided Wednesday, to determine only whether misconduct occured and whether punitive damages should be awarded. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, a lawyer defending the airline, said the company will appeal Wednesday's verdict. In a two-week civil trial, lawyers for families of the victims said the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was off course almost from the minute it left the ground in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and headed out over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Wreckage from the disaster was found in the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, hundreds of miles from the plane's scheduled flight path over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Two veteran pilots testifying as expert witnesses for the families theorized that the plane crew made a mistake in programming at least one of the computerized navigation systems on board the jumbo jet while the aircraft was waiting to take off. The error, said the two experts, sent the plane far west of its planned <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> flight path and into <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory, where it was stalked by Soviet military jets. Other witnesses suggested the crew members knew they were off course, but failed to return to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and correct the navigational problem for fear of disciplinary action and loss of respect from their colleagues. Lawyers representing <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> rejected those contentions, saying the crew radioed a position report that put it directly on course about an hour before it was shot down. Lawyers for the families suggested the crew was giving false position reports. `` I think as a matter of law willful misconduct was not shown by the evidence,'' said <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>. A defense motion to dismiss the case is pending before the judge. The jury's verdict `` was in accord with all the evidence,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Madole </PERSON>, a lawyer for the families. `` When this plane was flown off course into the danger area ... it was in fact willful misconduct.'' `` We think justice was done,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sincoff </PERSON>, another lawyer representing the families. The downing of Flight 007 `` was an unnecessary tragedy and many unanswered questions still remain,'' a group representing some families said in a statement after the verdict. `` We call on the Soviet government to address the KAL 007 shootdown by helping the victims ... including visitation rights to <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' over which the plane was attacked. The families want `` clarification of what happened to the remains of our loved ones,'' said the statement by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> 007 Victims. Eighty-one of the victims were South Korean, 61 American, 28 Japanese and the rest were other nationalities. At the start of the trial, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> suggested that both the Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments know far more about the tragedy than has been revealed to date, but that for national security reasons were n't disclosing it. `` There are people who know exactly where this plane was shot down and how it got there ... I am willing to bet my bottom dollar on it,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` I know what the capabilities are in this world ... certainly as between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' But <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said `` all that is beyond our ken and nobody will breathe a word about it.''

During the 10 months the rebels acquired hundreds of Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifles and an estimated 2,000 AK-47 assault rifles to augment their arsenal. The Dragunovs have an effective range of about 2,650 feet and have been used to damage several helicopters. The rifles have forced air force pilots to fly higher nd abandon more missions than at any time during the war.

 Eight Chinese performers have been missing for a week since they left a group returning to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but immigration officials said Tuesday no one had contacted them on behalf of the entertainers. `` All I can tell you is they have n't walked into this office and applied for any relief,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilchert </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Four other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizens have chosen to defect in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> since the June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. If the eight entertainers who fled the <LOCATION> Kun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> company last week seek political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it would be the largest single defection of Chinese citizens since the 1950s. `` Everybody in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wants to leave, so whoever has a chance to go out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, they will try to stay there,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shia </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kiangsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chekiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit association that helps <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> immigrants. The performers left the 28-member opera over a two-day period last week while the company was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> following a series of performances in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We have had zero contact with them or with the consulate,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Latting </PERSON>. `` We would like to talk to them. We always want any defector to know that we are a wonderful umbrella for them. We can help them get to us or any other agency.'' The opera company flew back to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Thursday, according to Officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, coordinator of VIP travel at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the Chinese consulate confirmed the eight performers did not leave with the company. `` They were influenced by people with ulterior motives,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaohua </PERSON>. Officals of the Chinese consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> have blamed the disappearance on `` people with motives to bring damage to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The missing entertainers include <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> <PERSON> Wen-Yi </PERSON>, a famous opera singer in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. Two other singers in the group, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong-Shen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ping-Ping </PERSON>, also are well known in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhan </PERSON> is a famous television and film star as well as an opera performer. The others were identified as <PERSON> Qui </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi-Ping </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin-Bao </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Sei-Long </PERSON>. `` I think at this moment they fear making a wrong move _ whether they should seek political asylum or use other reasons to remain here,'' said Shia. `` I think they are going to wait until this incident is cooled off and then decide what options they should take,'' he said. Although accounts of the disappearances differ, Shia, who spoke with several opera members last Wednesday, gave this description: Two members left during a farewell dinner on July 25, two others left that evening, three group leaders early the next day, Wednesday, and one performer left Wednesday morning. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>, an attorney who specializes in immigration and who has represented defectors, said the performers have numerous legal options. Because they arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> June 5, they are eligible for the emergency `` deferred departure status'' announced by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration in June.

Other options to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> include permanent labor certification, temporary work authorization or permanent residency if a relative successfully petitions on behalf of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizen.

 Twenty consultants earned more than $ 5.7 million by helping funnel much of the money in a federal housing program to developers in a handful of states that did n't need it, says a report to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. Most of the 20 consultants were former Housing and Urban Development employees or well-connected Republicans, said a report by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The consultants were paid by developers to help them get about one-fifth of the money from a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program to repair housing for the poor. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has reported before on the use of consultants in obtaining funds from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, but the new report is the first attempt to determine the extent and expense of the practice. Under the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program, developers were eligible for tax credits and could get <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to subsidize the rent of tenants who otherwise could n't afford it. In all, 51 projects with a total of 7,268 apartments funded since October 1983 used consultants, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' report found. That accounts for about 20 percent of all <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s work in this area during that time.

<HEAD>Already Poor, Nepal Tightens Belt After Trade Dispute with India</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Arguing with a big neighbor can be costly, as <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> is discovering four months after losing the first round of a trade dispute with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Already one of the world's poorest countries, landlocked and mountainous <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> faces difficult times unless it can come to terms with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on transporting its exports and imports across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> at previously favored rates. As a result of the dispute, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s deficit budget proposed for the fiscal year that started July 1 calls for expenditures to rise by 32 percent, compared to 8 percent the previous fiscal year. Gasoline prices have been raised by 48 percent. That reflects a threefold vulnerability of the Nepalese economy: steeper transit costs across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the declining value of the Nepalese rupee, and fluctuating crude oil prices in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Nepalese optimists say the trade and transit crisis with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will force <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> to develop its own infrastructure and become less reliant on others' largesse. Pessimists say any such period of adjustment will take several years and further sap the resources of the country. Although the Nepalese-Indian dispute was sparked by treaty terms on bilateral trade and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s access to Indian transit facilities for third-country trade, many observers in the region see a deeper _ and to some a more sinister _ reason. They describe it as <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s growing power and ambitions as a major military, political and economic force in the region <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> rejects such contentions. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s strength is in its majestic mountains and mystique that attract the tourists who provide about 20 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings Another 20 percent comes from the export of carpets, a business dominated by Tibetan refugees who fled Chinese rule in their homeland across the border. Its chief weakness is poverty. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s per capita annual income is $ 150. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund record only two other countries with equal or worse economic misery: <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, where the per capita income also is $ 150, and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, where it is $ 120. `` <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> can not remain an island of poverty any longer between the two countries in the region that are growing _ <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shailendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Upadhyaya </PERSON> said in an interview. `` <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> also has to grow.'' Growth, he added, includes expanding ties beyond <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, with a population of 880 million, and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, with 17 million people, had `` a special relationship'' between 1950 when the mountain kingdom emerged from hermit-like isolation and last March 23, when their trade and transit treaties lapsed. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, seeking to lessen dependence on its big neighbor, has been steadily diversifying its trading partners over the past 15 years. But to import goods, it relied on preferential rights to use <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s seaports, railroads and highways. This year, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> wanted to renew the two separate trade and transit treaties. But <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> insisted on a single treaty linking the two issues, saying it was unfair for <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> to expect generous transit privileges to import goods from other nations which often, as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Upadhyaya </PERSON> and other Nepalese officials acknowledged, end up getting smuggled back to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and sold at a profit. In 1975, 82 percent of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s foreign trade was with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. By April 1989, it had shrunk to 28 percent, according the fiscal 1988-89 economic survey issued in July by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON>'s government The proposed 1989-90 budget, released at the same time, calls for expenditures of about $ 736 million, with a deficit of $ 81.8 million to be financed primarily by foreign and domestic borrowing. One of the biggest increases is in petroleum products, which <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> has started purchasing on the international market instead of buying from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, itself a net importer of oil. Petroleum and other Nepalese imports still pass through <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> closed 13 of the 15 authorized border transit points when the March treaties lapsed and hassles at the two remaining points still crop up periodically. For the Nepalese consumer, this has resulted in rationing and skyrocketing prices, although the gasoline shortage of last spring and early summer is starting to ease. Most Nepalese do n't have cars, but those who do are now paying the equivalen of $ 3.18 a gallon instead of $ 2.18 a gallon.

<TEXT>
 Generations of fishermen reaped a bounty from the <LOCATION> Lambro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> before it became laced with garbage, smelly sewage and pesticides. Today the <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> beloved by poets, authors and artists hides much of its legendary beauty in a pall of smog, acres of concrete and millions of tons of industrial waste and urban garbage. Its waters are becoming poisoned, its landscape scarred, its forests withered by acid rain. Ecologists see the <PERSON> Lambro </PERSON> as one symptom of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s allergic reaction to its own 20th century. They say its fetid banks are a result of the feverish postwar economic expansion. Chemical wastes and agricultural runoff contaminate the <PERSON> Lambro </PERSON> as it flows like a sewer through <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s industrial heartland, from near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Como </LOCATION> past <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> to just west of <LOCATION> Piacenza </LOCATION> where it empties into the Po. The Po, the country's longest and most polluted river, winds through some of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most fertile farmland before it spills its toxins into the increasingly endangered <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Lambro </PERSON> is responsible for 30 percent of the total pollution in the Po,'' said <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mascazzini </PERSON>, an environmental official with <LOCATION> Lombardy </LOCATION>'s regional government. `` So the pollution is not only a problem because of what it does in <LOCATION> Lombardy </LOCATION>, but also because of what it does to the Po and the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION>.'' Still, he noted, the pollution is seeping into <LOCATION> Lombardy </LOCATION>'s soil and beginning to contaminate the aquifier that supplies 90 percent of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s drinking water. A year ago the government approved a five-year, $ 3.55 billion-project to clean the air, soil and water around the <PERSON> Lambro </PERSON>. It hailed the plan as a model, one that could lead to $ 22 billion in additional spending if extended to the rest of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The work has not begun. It has been stalled primarily by political squabbling common at all layers of Italian government. Various local governments and private industry have fought over their share of the financing and control of the project. Environmental groups maintain the plan is just another temporary remedy doomed to fail because it will not do enough to fight the sources of pollution. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerbini </PERSON>, a spokesman for the environmental <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauri </PERSON>, a World Wildlife Fund ecologist, contend the government is too strongly allied with big business, lacks the political will to confront long-term problems and reacts only to emergencies, such as the current algae invasion along <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> coastal resorts. A recent Ministry of the Environment report noted that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has only the capacity to legally dispose of about 30 percent of the 97.4 million tons of waste it produces each year, including 3.8 million tons considered toxic or dangerous. The report said half the 1,600 water purification plants in cities with a total population of 23 million do n't work. It added that 2 million people in other cities drink water tainted with herbicides and pesticides. The ministry said at least half the trees in Italian forests suffer damage from acid rain. In 1987 alone, it said, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> coughed 380,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, 2 percent of the Earth's emissions of the gas that is considered a major contributor to the `` Greenhouse Effect,'' or warming of the planet. `` <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was relatively slow to come to awareness about its evironmental problems,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Flavin </PERSON>, a vice president with the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Compared to northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> the air and water quality is worse ... and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has a lot more toxic wastes. It is a result of its lagging policies,'' <PERSON> Flavin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Environment Minister <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffolo </PERSON> said earlier this year that the government hopes to reduce pollution by 35 percent to 40 percent over five years. And <PERSON> Mascazzini </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Lombardy </LOCATION> environmental official, argues the <PERSON> Lambro </PERSON> plan is a new beginning toward that end. `` We agree that it is no longer possible to arrive at conclusive, effective environmental results by confronting the problems a piece at a time,'' <PERSON> Mascazzini </PERSON> said. `` The <PERSON> Lambro </PERSON> plan is an attempt to better organize the realization of so many things, so many projects.'' Its intent is to restore the land area between the <PERSON> Lambro </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Seveso </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Olona </PERSON> rivers. It would build five new water purification plants and enlarge 40 others, construct new sewer networks, pumping stations and waste treatment plants. The plan also would invest millions of dollars to clean the air, muffle the noise, build new parks and nature reserves and add safeguards to high-risk industries in densely populated areas.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON>'s dreams once fit into a bathtub. Thirty years later they cover an island in the Nile and have made him not only <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s papyrus king but also Pharaoh of a imaginary kingdom from the days of King Tut. The realm of the 78-year-old former diplomat and engineer is <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a finger of land south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> where he first established a papyrus farm, then re-created a 3,300-year-old village to give tourists glimpses of ancient Egyptian life from flat-bottom barges. Papyrus is everywhere on the island. His love affair with the willowy river plant began in 1955, after his appointment as <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s first ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On a countryside tour, he saw workers making paper by hand. `` I thought of my own country, once world-famous for producing paper from the papyrus plant,'' he said. `` Everything was written on it, from peace treaties to marriage contracts to medical instructions.'' But by the middle of the 20th century, `` papyrus was finished in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, except for a few ornamental plants,'' he added. `` I thought how great it would be if I could start a little industry, making paper again.'' In 1960, with papyrus stalks he cut in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> began experimenting in his bathtub. No one else could help him, he said, because papyrus-making, like mummification, was so sacred the ancients reserved it for the Pharaohs. For six years <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> cut papyrus pulp into strips, soaked them, dried them, hammered and pressed them into sheets. Nothing worked. `` I was down to my last coin,'' he said. `` Even my family thought I was stupid. One day my wife came in and gave me a choice of her or the dirty bathtub. `` But fortunately, for the papyrus industry and for me, I discovered my mistakes. I still had both a wife and a bathtub.'' <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> opened his first <ORGANIZATION> Papyrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which he called `` One of the Seven Wonders of Modern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' on a little houseboat in the Nile in 1966, growing the plant in surrounding Nile shallows. His papyrus paper attracted artists, who duplicated tomb paintings, golden faces of King <PERSON> Tut </PERSON> and ancient medical manuscripts. Lightweight and exotic, papyrus is `` the only true Egyptian souvenir,'' <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> said. Egyptian presidents give papyrus as gifts. In 1984, President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> portrait of the Sphinx with President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s face instead of a Pharaoh's. <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> estimates his industry now earns $ 100 million a year locally, $ 40 million internationally. But <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON>'s success was too great. Hundreds of papyrus factories sprang up, many making fake paper from banana skins or corn husks. Few tourists could tell the difference. `` You even have two villages with 30,000 people who gave up farming a couple of years ago, just to grow, make, paint and market papyrus,'' <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> said. He then had another idea. `` I realized there was no place for a tourist to learn about ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, about what he was seeing in the museums,'' he said. `` And I looked at <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s Island.'' What he saw in his mind's eye was `` a living village from the golden days of the New Kingdom, the time of King <PERSON> Tut </PERSON> and Ramses.'' He started work on it in the early 1980s, hired actors to take the roles of ancient Egyptians and by the time Dr. <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON>'s Pharaonic Village opened in 1985, he had poured $ 8 million into it, a fortune built with papyrus But tourist agencies avoided it and many still do. Tour books did n't mention it and most still do n't. But <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> holds on. `` This should be the first stop for any tourist,'' said art teacher <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, in front of a scaled-down Pharaonic temple. `` It teaches you so much. It's going to be one of our favorite highlights of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' Equally as enthusiastic was Dr. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, a surgeon from <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who had brought his wife and three children to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to learn something of his native land `` It's a miracle,'' <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON>. `` You've done <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> proud.'' <PERSON> Ragab </PERSON> smiled.

<HEAD>Soviet Tourists in Israel Trade Caviar for Computers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet tourists, starved for consumer goods back home, are trading caviar for computers and using borrowed rubles to buy video cassette recorders. `` This video will pay for the trip,'' said <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> housewife in her 40s, clutching a VCR at Ben-Gurion International Airport. `` Everybody is buying videos. I wanted to bring another one for my son, but I did not have the money.'' As a result of a thaw in Soviet relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, thousands of Soviet Jews have been visiting relatives and friends in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. En route many stop in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, to purchase electronic goods that can be resold in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where a VCR can fetch the equivalent of 10 months' salary _ about 2,000 rubles, $ 3,140 at the official rate of exchange. <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> and other travelers demanded anonymity because they feared reprisals for engaging in black market transactions. One recent flight from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> carried 60 Soviet tourists with 26 VCRs and two double-deck radio-cassette players. One Georgian family was seen pushing a cart with three VCRs. The tourists are required to leave the VCRs and other goods at the airport to be picked up when they leave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Some Soviet visitors, who include musicians and artists of Soviet touring groups, bring luxury items like caviar that are scarce in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to trade for personal computers and other electronic equipment. `` My refrigerator was packed with caviar tins,'' said <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weismel </PERSON>, an Israeli computer programmer in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> who recently hosted a Soviet theater troupe. He said the Soviets brought French perfume and caviar purchased on the black market back home and sold them here for several times the price. They then bought personal computers, which cost $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An additional $ 7,850 must be paid in customs taxes when they arrive back home. But once in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a computer can be sold to a factory or a state-owned business for the equivalent of $ 78,500 to $ 110,000. Other Soviet visitors select one of a half-dozen Israeli firms offering a different way to buy electronics. `` We offer a transit deal,'' said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterenhal </PERSON> of Tal-Hen & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Khanan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> in the Israeli coastal town of <LOCATION> Netanya </LOCATION>. `` Soviet tourists order tax-free products, which are delivered by our European branch directly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The firm, which advertizes in some of the seven Russian-language newspapers published in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, offers Soviet Jews radios, tape cassette players, VCRs, televisiion sets and personal computers. Attendants said not a day passes without a Soviet coming into the store `` to buy something, at least a radio.'' But the Soviet tourists also buy other things in short supply at home. <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON>, a retired biochemist from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, bought a $ 7.50 baroque freshwater-pearl necklace as a present for her daughter. `` In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, its costs 200 rubles -LRB- $ 314 -RRB-,'' or about an average month's salary, she said. While the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does not allow the use of hard currency to import luxury items, it tolerates private imports. `` There is a tremendous demand for all kinds of goods that the government ca n't supply,'' said <PERSON> Galia </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON>, a Soviet specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` So they have always permitted the black market and the second economy to continue.''

<HEAD>Watch Those Little Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It is the little numbers, not the big and obvious ones, that cause those inflation troubles. While everyone is aware of shockingly large numbers, it is the little ones that undermine economies. At the moment, 4 percent inflation is viewed as moderate, and in fact some officials proclaim that inflation is under control. It does look like a small number, but repeat it enough and it becomes very, very big. Four percent inflation cuts a dollar to 50 cents in 13 years. It adds $ 22,000 to a $ 100,000 house in five years. In three years it adds 3 cents to the newsstand price of a 25-cent newspaper. Not much? Just $ 9 or $ 10 a year. Except for the decade of the 1970s and early 1980s, when inflation ran away with people's wallets, it has been little percentages that have changed the value of our money. In 30 years the Consumer Price Index has risen more than 300 percent. In appearance, 4 percent is deceitfully small, but little numbers compound in the same manner as large numbers. Four percent inflation this year becomes part of the base for next year's 4 percent, and on and on. Inflation is insidious, occurring right under the noses of people but somehow obscured from their eyes. It happens when small prices are raised by small amounts, and when big prices are raised by seemingly tiny percentages. When a 22-cent postage stamp rose three cents it created a temporary hullabaloo, but many people recognized 25 cents as the next `` logical'' plateau for the price. But those three pennies represented nearly 14 percent. If all prices rose at 14 percent a year your dollar would be 50 cents in five years. A suburban weekly newspaper recently jumped to 50 cents from 40 cents, only a dime but a 25 percent increase. The fee on a credit card went from $ 20 a year to $ 30, a $ 10 difference but a 50 percent increase. Most people are aware of the consequences of seemingly small increases when translated into percentages. But even when they do, they often excuse it. Somehow, a 50-cent item `` should'' go to 55 cents rather than 52 cents. And, when vending machines are involved, an increase in a 50-cent candy bar must be at a minimum of 10 percent because the machine declines to count mere pennies. In this way vending machine inflation is created, and excused. Inflation also is disguised when expensive items rise by small percentages, as in a 2 percent increase in car prices that adds $ 200 to the tab, and a 3 percent rise that adds $ 17,000 to a $ 100,000 house in about five years. Consider: That small percentage increase might have been sufficient to disqualify thousands of young couples who had been saving for a down payment. At 20 percent down, the dollars needed would have jumped to $ 23,400 from $ 20,000. The same impact is felt when the variable mortgage rate rises by one-half of 1 percent but adds $ 50 a month to the carrying cost, or when a small percentage increase in valuation raises the real estate tax $ 150. Watch those little numbers. Never let them out of your sight. Never trust them. In just the past 10 years they have driven up the price of milk 33 percent, single-family homes 67 percent, new cars 46 percent. They are devious, deceitful, and misleading. They delude otherwise thoughtful, responsible people. While the blockbuster numbers get blamed, those little ones hide like termites in the foundation.

 Ten years after gleaming silver trains started rolling along the South's first rapid-transit system, a 1,582-mile network of 150 bus routes and two rail lines with 29 stations carries a quarter-million passengers a day. The <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> has been hailed for its safety and cleanliness. <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION> celebrated its trains' 10th birthday with a free-ride day on July 4 that drew a record 435,000 passengers. A revitalized Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> draws up to 100,000 extra passengers a week, many of them first-time riders. But <PERSON> MARTA </PERSON> has a problem: It increasingly goes where much of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is n't. When <PERSON> MARTA </PERSON> was launched in 1971, the three suburban counties that refused it _ Cobb to the northwest, <PERSON> Gwinnett </PERSON> to the northeast and <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> to the south _ were largely rural, and it was hard to imagine subway cars rolling past farms and forests. Those three counties now hold nearly 900,000 people, three-fourths the number in the two central counties, <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> and DeKalb, where <PERSON> MARTA </PERSON> runs. Despite suburban traffic that is getting worse and suburban jobs that go begging because car-less workers ca n't reach them, opposition to expanding the system remains. Joining would almost surely mean higher taxes, and suburban politicians have been loathe to submit to decision-makers in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But the chief reason given by many opponents is the fear <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION> will bring crime to their tranquil neighborhoods. That feeling is widely seen as racism. <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION>'s passengers reflect central <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which is predominantly black. Atlantans may not like to discuss it, but few have n't heard the acronym explained as: `` Moving Africans Rapidly Through <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' `` The people you hear opposing <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> and Gwinnett ... they've been pretty open about it. They do n't want black people coming into their areas,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, a civil rights leader and a member of <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION>'s board since 1975. `` It's blind prejudice and fear. `` We feel its in everyone's interest to have a regional transit agency providing all the service,'' said General Manager <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON>. `` It makes sense, it's much more cost-effective, unencumbered by the problems of numerous political jurisdictions. I think that position ultimately will prevail.'' `` I think <PERSON> MARTA </PERSON>'s future is contingent on that,'' said <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>. `` Its maximum potential will never be realized until we go north to <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> and south to <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>. ... We at least need five counties.'' End-of-the-line stops on <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION>'s cross-shaped rail system do a booming business as thousands of <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> residents drive across the county line and hop on the train. Some luxury hotels in <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> have even sent vans to ferry workers across the <LOCATION> Chattahoochee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which marks the county line. But MARTA trains and buses are n't going to cross that bridge anytime soon. `` They're pretty much against it, at least in my end of the county,'' said <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON>. `` A number of the people who have moved into the south end are transplants from <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and a lot of them feel like <PERSON> MARTA </PERSON> ran them out of town.'' `` Without being obvious, people say that ease of transportation would bring in ` the undesirables' and crime,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Gwinnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who has advocated at least a trial run of <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION> buses. Even talking about <PERSON> MARTA </PERSON> can be tricky in the suburbs. A discussion group with <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> leaders in 1980 had a `` code name so folks would n't know about it,'' <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said. But more and more, suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> may be coming to the conclusion that something must be done. A one-mile trip down a major thoroughfare in <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> or Gwinnett can take more than a half-hour, and residents of those counties named traffic as their No. 1 problem in a recent <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution poll. The poll found between 54 percent and 60 percent of <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> county residents favored MARTA trains in their communities, although only in <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were a majority willing to pay the 1 percent sales tax that <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents pay for <PERSON> MARTA </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last month launched its own five-route bus system. Ten thousand people used it the first week, more than twice the volume expected for the first three weeks, forcing officials to drop a radio advertising campaign for fear they would n't be able to meet the demand. The busiest <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> route is one dropping commuters at a midtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> MARTA subway station. Ultimately, the service plans 10 routes, including three more <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> express runs. Riders get free transfers to <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION> under a deal that allows <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION> riders to hop on <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s buses. The system, costing the county an estimated $ 2 million a year, makes more sense than giving <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION> an estimated $ 65 million a year in local sales taxes, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronoff </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> CCT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does n't look like it would make sense to provide more than we provide. ... <ORGANIZATION> MARTA </ORGANIZATION>'s the best system in the country, but it does n't have all the answers.'' `` In my judgment, they're fooling themselves,'' <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said. `` Ten bus routes are n't going to even dent, are n't going to put an infinitesimal impact, on their traffic congestion. And starting a bus system that brings four routes in the city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> ai n't going to do it. <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has no public transportation. Gwinnett, which has none either, will vote next year on some sort of mass transit referendum. Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> hopes it will once and for all answer questions like what the county wants and will pay for. `` I hope they'll use reason and understanding, rather than ... illogical rationale,'' she said, pointing out that the county's 330,000 population will more than double in the next 20 years `` The sheer mathematics of it says we have got to come up with some method of handling all those people. `` It's inevitable. It's time to fish or cut bait.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> made his film debut as a street urchin when his mother, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, played <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> in `` Taming of the Shrew'' in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, his stepfather at the time, played <PERSON> Petruchio </PERSON> in the 1967 film. `` I ran alongside <PERSON> Petruchio </PERSON>'s horse on the way to the wedding,'' said <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON>, who has joined the cast of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' `` My brother, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON>, was also an extra. I had braces on my teeth and we wore little codpieces and velvet caps. We kept shouting, ` <ORGANIZATION> Petruchio </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Petruchio </PERSON>.''' After that beginning, <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON>'s acting was put on hold for many years in favor of education. His major role so far was that of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` A.D.'' The son of <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, has his mother's violet eyes and dark complexion. His black hair has streaks of gray. <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> will play art dealer <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> in the new `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' season. `` He's kind of a <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> because he finds a young artist and sees a great potential in her,'' he said of <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>. `` He feels he can steer her in the right direction to become a great artist. She's a primitive artist, like <PERSON> Grandma </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>.'' The young artist is <PERSON> Callie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, the wife of <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> played by <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Podewell </PERSON>. A romantic interest develops between the two. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, of course, is J.R. `` I have n't had any scenes with <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> said. `` So far, <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> does n't know anything about us or he is n't interested enough. There's such a contrast between <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Callie </PERSON>. He's incredibly worldly and sophisticated and she's a country girl. `` I think he feels he can steer her into becoming a worldly and stylish person with a bit of tutoring. He wants to change her. Personally, I'd leave her the way she is. She's a very sweet lady.'' More recently, <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> had a small role in one of his mother's projects, `` Sweet Bird of Youth'' for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> He plays a movie producer who tries to talk his mother, playing a fading actress, into working in a film. `` In the scene we're on the telephone, so I just played one side of the conversation,'' he said. `` I'm looking forward to seeing the scene put together. When I got the part I thought it would be fun to work with her, but I guess she filmed her part several weeks later. I've yet to act in a scene with her.'' <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> and his wife, actress <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Palance </PERSON>, the daughter of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Palance </PERSON>, recently made <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> a grandmother again. Their son, <PERSON> Tarquin </PERSON>, was born about two weeks ago. <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> has two daughters, <PERSON> Laela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON>, from a previous marriage. He moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> a few months ago to find work. `` I knew there's be more work here,'' he said, `` but I'm still going through withdrawal symptoms. I'd been quite stubborn about making myself believe there was work in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' He got the role in `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' by auditioning for it. Asked about the advantages or disadvantages of famous parents, <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> said, `` I really do n't think it opened any doors. I think it got me some interviews. If I was doing an Off Broadway show it would arouse some interest. But I do n't think it got me any roles, which is the way I want it. I'd hate to go through my career thinking my parts came because of my parents.'' <PERSON> Wilding </PERSON> grew up mostly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and attended Swiss and English boarding schools. He had a tutor when he went on location with his parents. `` I grew up on locations,'' he said. `` I still love locations. I remember being on the sets for ` Cleopatra.' They had some great naval battles. That was fun for a 9-year-old. She entered <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on a sphinx pulled by Nubian slaves. It opens up and thousands of doves fly out. I remember when all the extras were assembled to hail <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON>. The first time they all yelled, ` <PERSON> Liz </PERSON>!'''

<HEAD>Protestant Denominations Stiffen Reservations About Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denominations which once widely condoned abortion now either oppose it or specify limitations to it. They've modified their positions. The changes have come over the last decade as abortions went on at the rate of about 1.5 million a year and advances in embryology increased understanding of the developing fetus. Aware of such factors, denominational conventions, one after another, have qualified their stands on abortions, voicing misgivings about it and condemning use of it for various purposes. `` They've back-pedaled,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He said the `` staggering statistics'' and the new therapeutic embryology on distinctive characteristics of the fetus as not part of the woman's body, `` have made for second and third thoughts'' about abortion. `` The whole movement toward more conservative religious positions also doubtlessly accounts to some extent for the shift,'' he added in a telephone interview. The revisions began long before the recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision expanding state jusisdiction on the issue, but became general among mainline denominations in the 1980's. Although recognizing abortion's legality and individual decision-making about it, four major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denominations last year added extensive circumstances in which it was rejected. The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, stiffening its past stance, sanctioned abortion `` only in extreme situations. We emphatically oppose abortion as a means of birth control, family planning, sex selection, or any reason of mere convenience.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, while recognizing `` tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion,'' added opposition to it as a means of birth control or gender selection. The Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB- added language saying abortion `` should not be used for convenience or to ease embarrassment or as a means of birth control.'' The church, now engaged in a major reappraisal of the abortion issue, has scheduled a pro-and-con dialogue on it Nov. 17-19 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. American Baptist Churches, in a revised, middle-ground stance, denounced `` irresponsible sexual behaivor'' contributing to the `` large number of abortions each year,'' and says: `` As American Baptists we oppose abortion, as a means of avoiding responsibility for conception, as a primary means of birth control without regard for the far-reaching consequences of the act.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> maintains a clearly pro-choice position, reaffirming it in July at a general synod in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, at the same time the high court upheld some state prerogatives on the issue. The denomination deplored the court decision, charging it would make `` freedom of choice'' difficult for the poor. It also, however, set a special `` theology colloquy'' on the the subject Aug. 13-18 in <LOCATION> Craigville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. While Roman Catholicism, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodoxy </ORGANIZATION>, the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day Saints -LRB- Mormons -RRB-, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and various evangelical churches have steadily condemned abortion, several <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> bodies joined that effort near the turn of the l980's. About that time, the nation's biggest Protestant body, Southern Baptists, began stiffening opposition to abortion, and now condemns it in all cases except to save the life of the mother. The former <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, now merged into the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, toughened its anti-abortion stand in 1980 and 1984, when it opposed all abortions as destroying life. Laws were urged protecting it `` from conception to birth.'' Episcopalians, revising their position about it last year, voted down proposed language that would have opposed legislative restrictions on abortion. Such legislatives moves incubated following the recent high court decision. Orthodox Jews condemn abortion except when the mother's life is endangered, while Reform and <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> approve it in less threatening situations. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, including most major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern Orthodox denominations, has never taken a position on abortion because of diverse views about it. Most churches historically had condemned abortion prior to the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing it, but mainline Protestant bodies afterward moved to support the decision and right of women to abortion. While some still uphold that right, they've raised sharpened reservations about it. Of the keen stress over the issue, Episcopal Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said: `` We know that, at its heart, abortion involves tragedy, as the loss of any life or promise of life can be tragic. The reasons for abortions can involve other tragedies. `` Our discussion of abortion must begin with an understanding that we are dealing with a tangled web of rights and wrongs, good and evil, and greater and lesser tragedies.''

 The Statue of Liberty welcomes the world's tired and wretched poor, but these days the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> beckons the world's brightest and most ambitious as well Nations which see their brightest people settle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or come here to study and stay to work, have a name for the phenomena: `` the brain drain.'' In this country, it could be called the brain rain _ the enrichment of the American terrain by smart people who find this land fertile. It has been going on for two centuries, but the magnet nowadays is a secret American asset _ the quality of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> graduate school education. Public schooling may be in a mess, but graduate schools here are a wonder of the academic world. Now a crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and liberalization in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may mean those countries will join others in wondering how to get their smart young people home after they've seen the labs at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>. In a gesture comparable to tearing down the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is moving to relax barriers that have kept Russians from leaving. -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade concessions would likely result. -RRB- About 33,000 Russians emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. This year, they're coming at the rate of 120,000. Next year, says <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consul in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the number could approach 250,000. Many are the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s smartest, best trained people. Under a draft Soviet law, Soviet citizens would be free to leave if they can wangle an invitation from almost any business, organization or individual. When the democracy movement perished in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, 29,040 Chinese students were enrolled in American schools, part of a contingency of 355,000 foreign students studying in this country. Many of the Chinese are likely to want to stay. If they succeed, it will be a setback for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modernization drive, a bonus for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Fear of losing talented people has been `` a traditional problem in communist regimes,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a space expert at the Federation of American Scientists. `` That was basically what led to the Berlin Wall; the best and the brightest were bailing out of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` One reason communist economies have done so poorly is because the cream always was skimmed off.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orleans </PERSON>, in an analysis written for the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> with the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said even before <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> that any decision by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students to remain abroad would be seen by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as not only `` a loss to the country, in terms of both money spent on their education and their potential contribution to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s development, but also a painful loss of face.'' `` The ` flight of intellectual capital' has been of great concern to all developing countries, especially since those individuals who tend to remain abroad are precisely the ones with the greatest initiative and enterprise,'' Orleans observed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> depended upon foreign schooling as a way of leaping into the 21st century. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> itself was capable of granting a piddling 664 PhDs between 1981 and 1987. Before leaving home, Chinese students are warned that their parents may suffer if they do n't return, <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Vetter </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> put its traveling students on tight timetables _ two years for earning a masters degree, five for a Phd, and then home again, please. American students usually take eight years for a PhD, and that's without a language barrier to overcome The brain drain troubles American allies, too. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> loses talent to the lure of the big market to the south, and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> loses faculty. British universities are cutting back on staffing and `` many major American universities are picking up the stars of the British academic world,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, editor and publisher of Science & amp; Government Report.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s easing of its credit policy and the accompanying drop in interest rates have posed a $ 325 billion question for investors in money market mutual funds. Should they sit tight with their money in the face of declining yields, or look elsewhere for better returns? If the past record is any guide, the vast majority of money fund assets will stay put. From 1975, when the earliest money funds had attracted less than $ 4 billion, to this year, when their assets have swollen by more than $ 50 billion from $ 272 billion at the end of 1988, the long-term industry trend has shown almost uninterrupted growth. Periods of low or falling interest rates halted the funds' expansion only briefly In 1983, for example, when interest rates were falling and stocks were soaring in the early stages of a spectacular bull market, money fund assets shrank by about 20 percent. A year later, they rebounded once again to new highs. Today's savers and investors have a wider range of competitive alternatives to choose among than ever before. And thanks to rallies in the stock and bond markets, funds that invest in those long-term securities have been producing substantially higher returns than money funds have offered. Late last month, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Moneyletter, a newsletter that tracks developments affecting fund investors, issued a `` buy'' signal recommending a move from money funds to growth stock funds for venturesome investors. But with all that, many investors _ especially those who view their money fund holdings as a kind of modern-day savings account _ may find few other choices that appeal more to them on the basis of both risk and potential reward. The risks of stock market investing, of course, are well advertised. At a recent yield of 8.85 percent, analysts point out, money funds still offer rewards close to the historical average annual return of 9 percent to 10 percent posted by the stock market. What about the other alternatives? Tax-free money funds, investing in state and local government securities whose interest is not subject to federal taxation, recently were yielding about 5.6 percent to 5.7 percent. That put them at an unattractive level, by <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s reckoning, even for an investor in the 33 percent bracket. Bank money-market deposit accounts have the allure of federal deposit insurance, but their typical yields of about 6.5 percent languish far below their money fund competitors. People wanting to lock in yields as protection against further declines in interest rates traditionally turn to long-term bond investments. These days, however, they are n't very well compensated for making that commitment. In late July the yield available on the longest-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds slipped below 8 percent. Double-digit yields can still be found in abundance in so-called `` junk bonds'' and the mutual funds that specialize in these lower-rated securities. But some advisers say this is an especially dangerous time to be increasing credit risk. `` Much of the newly issued ` junk' securities have not been tested in a period of prolonged adversity,'' says the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Babson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> Report. `` A sacrifice in yield is well worth the price of safety, and a good night's sleep.'' Indeed, while investors are casting a wary eye on the other options, analysts say they may want to give their money funds a fresh appraisal as well. Sponsors of two funds, the Value Line Cash Fund and the <ORGANIZATION> Liquid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, reached into their own pockets in June to cover losses that resulted from a default on short-term securities issued by <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. As a result of their response, fund shareholders lost no money But the experience was `` a humbling lesson,'' as <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s described it, for an industry that prides itself on its safety record

 It takes a mighty aggregation of man, machine and fossil - fuel power to move the gross national product a fraction of a point, but in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> it can be done by researchers using only calculator power They do it again and again, month after month, revising important economic measurements, some of which might have been, when first announced, the basis for decisions regarding business and economic policy. Revisions are a regular occurrence in statistics, produced mainly by access to additional information or changes in methodology. In some instances they are expected; in some, they are not. In either event, they can dismay. Several years ago, for example, rising retail sales were reported month after month, giving the impression of a boom. But, when viewed after a year, sales had risen only moderately. The reason: The monthly increases were based not on original figures but on later revisions. Repeatedly, those revisions were downward, meaning increases for the following months were from a base lower than originally stated. Some important revisions recently were made in estimates of gross national product, perhaps the broadest of all economic measurements and one that often guides the direction of fiscal and monetary policy. This revision raised the growth of real GNP for 1987 to 3.7 percent from 3.4 percent, a difference of $ 6.7 billion, and for 1988 to 4.4 percent from 3.9 percent, a difference of $ 28.3 billion. Those are n't puny numbers, even in an economy where the value of a billion shrinks by the day. In fact, they are momentous figures when you consider that overheating vs. recession was one of the biggest economic concerns in each of those years, and that the GNP measurement was one of the primary indicators. Whatever, decisions must be made in a critical time frame too immediate to wait for revisions. Battles are fought with the weapons on hand, not with arsenals promised. Gen. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> launched an invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after reading weather reports later found to be faulty. Later, President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> steered economic policy although, in review, the economic data he relied upon was less than perfect. Statistical faults are accepted, the attitude seeming to be that nothing better is available. If poor decisions are made, so be it. If good news comes in the revision, enjoy it and hope it wo n't be revised out later. Good news did indeed come in the July revisions. For one thing, they made the trade deficit appear less ominous, in one swipe erasing more than $ 25 billion from the negative 1988 numbers. In 1988, it is now believed that the deficit, stated in 1982 dollars, was $ 74.9 billion, not $ 100.2 billion. The main reason for the revisions, it now appears, is that the `` exporting'' of education and tourism was undercounted. Well, not quite; in the language of the fraternity, each was `` enhanced,'' but the net impact is the same no matter what language is used. So big was the enhancement that one economist, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, issued a comment in a language seldom heard from economists. `` Wow,'' he said. How significant is it, he asked? Plenty, he said, explaining that the trade picture in goods and services is simply that much better, `` and the case for foreign investor panic about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imbalances is all but over.'' Economists are known to disagree, of course; not all are saying `` wow.'' Some will claim the improvement would have been more meaningful if it involved the export of pig iron rather than education. Not Barbera. `` As we see it, it is better to have state-of-the-art schools vs. state-of-the-art steel mills,'' he declares. Besides, the dollars count no matter how they are earned, or when they are added to the accounts, or even if it takes some recalculations to discover them.

 The goose hangs by its feet from a thick rope stretched across the town square on the feast day of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the patron saint of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. A rider on horseback passes underneath and yanks the head off. He has his prize and the crowd cheers. Another goose is brought out and strung up for another rider. Critics call it barbarous. But to the thousands of Spaniards in the villages and towns, yearly fiestas that often involve the ritualistic killing of a goose or a rooster or a bull are an essential part of their lives and an affirmation of their cultural identity. None of the onlookers at the fiesta in this agricultural village of 2,500 near the <LOCATION> Tagus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the rolling hills of central <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> could say for certain why the eight male riders dressed in black britches and embroidered jackets try to pull the heads off geese. But they know young men have been doing it every July 25, the feast day, for 400 years, at least. The practice gained notice abroad about five years ago when photographs of the event appeared in the British press. Headlines called the Spaniards barbarians and worse. Nowadays the geese have been injected with a tranquilizer. `` They're numb, they do n't feel anything, that's all I'll say,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalba </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedeno </PERSON>. Anthropologists surmise that the practice grew out of a celebration of the legendary appearance of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, or St. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, at the Battle of <PERSON> Navas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolosa </PERSON> in 1212, sparking a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> victory over the Moors. The geese represent the Moors, who ruled much of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for more than 700 years. In some towns, the sacrificial victim is a bull, whose ritualistic importance in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> can be traced back to the pre-historic caves across the northern part of the country and to the Iberian culture that pre-dates the Romans. The bulls at one time were burned alive. Now the ends of their horns are set alight with flaming balls of tar, sending the bulls into panicked flight. Young boys chase them and beat them with sticks until the fire in the tar balls dies out. In one town, the bulls are killed after that but in others they are then left alone. In other towns bulls are driven over cliffs into the sea. Townspeople rescue them from the water, but if the bulls break their legs or are otherwise injured they are taken to the slaughter house. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Baroja </PERSON>, the dean of Spanish anthropologists, has done extensive studies of the fiestas, their relation to the seasonal cycle and the role of animals in them. The ritual killing of animals, he writes, serves an expiatory function that has been incorporated, if not explicity sanctioned, by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. In <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tajo </PERSON>, a rider carrying the religious banner of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> precedes the goose-beheaders. `` We've received hundreds of letters of protest from foreigners who've read about the geese and other fiestas involving animals,'' said <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiemblo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, head of information at <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s Secretariat for Tourism `` I've talked to town officials who tell me, ` Let them complain. It's our fiesta, and we'll keep on doing it the way we want.''' The <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has joined forces with other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> organizations to encourage governments of the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to pass legislation banning cruelty to animals. There is little likelihood such action will prosper in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` Our fiestas are cruel. I did n't realize how cruel they were until I started going out and studying them,'' said <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hontoria </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traditions </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We Spaniards do have our brutish side, but we can also be very brave.'' During the 36-year dictatorship of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, many fiestas, particularly those that emphasized regional or local characteristics, were suppressed. Pre-Lenten carnivals were banned as being too licentious until authorities figured out that it drew tourism. Following the return to democracy 12 years ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hontoria </PERSON> said, Spaniards began to celebrate their fiestas with renewed gusto. `` It seems now with modernization, everyone wants to go back to his roots, and people see that they can lose their fiestas if they do n't defend them.''

<HEAD>Colombians Pushing Their Flowers To Counter Drug Image</HEAD>

 This land of drug cartels and violence is also the land of beautiful flowers, and those who grow them are about to launch an advertising campaign to get Americans and Canadians to buy more of them. `` We counter the violence of drugs with the beauty of our flowers as a real image representing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> more than anything else,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flowers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Years of sustained efforts to produce popular flower types _ particularly carnations and chrysanthemums, in addition to the exotic specimens native to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> _ have earned <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> a respectable second place after the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> among flower-exporting nations. Flowers represented $ 205 million last year in export revenues, more than double the amount of 1980. Next year could be another all-time record for Colombian growers and dealers if their goal of $ 260 million in exports is met. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 8 percent to 10 percent share of the international market over recent years, surpassing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, reflects the drive of its flourishing non-traditional export industry. All this despite all sorts of difficulties, including embarassing actions by drug traffickers who often smuggle cocaine with shipments of flowers. Last year a cargo plane of Avianca, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> national airline, was seized in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after the police found cocaine concealed in the soil of a flower shipment. Fined $ 3 million, <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> halted its overseas cargo operations and Colombian florists had to look for other airlines to ship their flowers _ at much higher rates. Flower shipments now are subject to stricter controls at the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> airport in an effort to detect hidden drugs. Flowers, <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> said, are `` innocent victims of drug traffickers.'' Flower cultivators, like any other businessmen, are constantly adapting to the mood of customers. `` Flowers are like clothes: colors and taste for them change,'' <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> said. `` And we have to follow the customers' whims.'' Flowers began as a tiny portion of Colombian exports in the mid-1960s, when they accounted for less than $ 100,000 annually. Colombian florists feel confident that their business will be rosier if the $ 8 million advertising campaign to persuade Americans and Canadians to buy more flowers is successful. Studies by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> florists associations indicate Americans and Canadians buy flowers mostly to give to others and rarely for themselves. `` Europeans take flowers to their homes as much as they send them as gifts,'' <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> said. `` Our studies demonstrate that West Germans, famous for their lavish preference for flowers, buy as much as eight times more flowers than Canadians and Americans.'' Colombian floriculturists joined the 28,000-member <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transworld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delivery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to launch the advertising campaign, which begins in September. `` The future lies in convincing Americans and Canadians to change habits and persuade them to buy flowers for themselves, too,'' <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> said.

 On this Wednesday one of the people they'd nourished day after day, hopefully and compassionately, died It was all too usual. Word of the death was passed around the office and at a storefront church in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, the man's neighborhood. But God's Love We <ORGANIZATION> Deliver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> kept up its work _ feeding people who are confined to their homes by AIDS. `` We deal with it all the time,'' said program director <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>. `` It may be harder in some ways, but it is also much richer. The issue of life and death is the great magnifying glass. `` I do n't get it when people ask how we can do this. It's not as if if you worked in a bank you never had to handle the death issue. This is a really great training program for what is inevitable for all of us.'' `` I do n't think any of us is qualified to find a cure for AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnes </PERSON>, one of 450 volunteers who make sure nearly 200 homebound AIDS patients get gourmet, high-calorie food five days a week. `` But we are qualified to keep people alive until such time as a cure is found, so it's a life-saving job.'' There is eloquence in the preparation and delivery of nourishment that provides a bounty beyond calories. On Valentine's Day, the delivery to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> landscaper, included heart-shaped cookies and roses. `` I opened it up, expecting a meal and it was a party. I started crying from happiness.'' There were flowers and cake on his 39th birthday. `` I did n't know they knew,'' he said `` But they said it was all in the computer.'' Early one morning, eight people chat in the small, well-equipped kitchen in the basement at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. They fill plastic containers of cream of mushroom soup and containers of pasta, hamburger, and carrots and peas. There also are a salad and homemade cookies this day. Soup and vegetables cook in stock pots on two stoves. The air is stifling, and two fans do far less than volunteers' attitudes to ease the discomfort. A visitor pitches in as she looks over the program with an eye to starting something similar in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Later in the day, the power goes out, and hurried plans are made to protect the food. The clients still need meals. In the kitchen, there is gentle banter, about a book someone will write, or their own efficiency. No one complains and no hands are allowed to remain idle. Newcomers are warmly welcomed, often with a hug, but then an apron is given over and a chore assigned. These are people with a mission. `` We all do it because it makes us feel good. It is n't about being a saint,'' said <PERSON> Johnes </PERSON>, a writer from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. God's Love produces made-from-scratch meals from a rotating 30-day menu that includes carrot bisque, artichoke salad, smoked turkey, shish kebab, four-cheese lasagna, veal stroganoff, pears in puff pastry and fruit Bavarian. `` We have a big food budget and we buy top quality. But we're pretty frugal,'' said chef <PERSON> Luli </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who saves the drippings from one day's beef for another day's soup or sauce Leftovers are packed, marked and frozen for use. A walk-in refrigerator was donated by the Gay Men's Chorus. God's Love needs a bigger kitchen; it always needs money and volunteers. As AIDS spreads from homosexual men to intravenous drug users, their lovers and their children, the work will only increase. The goal is that no homebound person with acquired immune deficiency syndrome ever goes hungry. `` We are dedicated to not putting anybody on a waiting list,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bressler </PERSON>, the organization's executive chef. Clients had lost an average of 18 pounds from the onset of AIDS to the time they began receiving meals, but gained an average of 10 pounds after meals were delivered, <PERSON> Bressler </PERSON> said. One symptom of AIDS is loss of appetite, so he works to make sure the food is `` not only nutritious and fattening but appetizing. `` We try to keep their weight up, and that's adding to their strength ... and that's what we're here for.'' Cooking begins daily at 7:30 a.m., and meals go into four vans by 10 a.m., when work starts on tomorrow's meals. By 2:30 p.m., everyone has been fed. The kitchen closes at 9. `` When the kitchen opened in August 1987, we were serving six meals. Now, we're serving 160 to 180,'' said <PERSON> Bressler </PERSON>. Meals go to all five <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> boroughs and <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. Some are delivered directly to homes; others are left at churches, homes, a Red Cross office or bars, where neighborhood volunteers take them to people with AIDS. Twenty-five or 30 meals a day are made to suit special medical needs. <PERSON> Johnes </PERSON> came to God's Love as a volunteer after donating money for a year and deciding that was n't enough. `` I came the Friday night before Christmas and made orange zest, crushed garlic and peeled 25 pounds of cucumbers. I went to bed smelling like a salad.'' On Christmas Day, he delivered meals. `` Nourishment is important,'' he said. `` It's not controversial. How can you argue with people who feed other people?'' God's Love We Deliver was conceived in 1985 when <PERSON> Ganga </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, now executive director, took groceries to a man suffering from AIDS and was horrified to find him too weak to get up and cook the food. She decided to do something. First, she cooked at home and delivered meals on her bicycle. Then meals were solicited from restaurants. Finally, in August 1987, God's Love moved to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION>. From a woman on her bike, God's Love grew to a staff of 22 and a budget for 1989 of more than $ 1 million. It is financed by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> and other donations and grants. Originally, clients were mostly white, homosexual men. Now, maybe half are intravenous drug users and their children. Many are women. When <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> was released from a hospital 1 -LCB- years ago, he called God's Love at a friend's suggestion and talked with Stone. `` She said how about a meal today or tomorrow, then we'll do the paperwork.'' When he called God's Love, `` I was n't eating very much. I'd go into the kitchen, open the refrigerator and think, ` Oh, that's all I can deal with,' and close it. It was too exhausting to do more.'' When he did summon the energy to cook, <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said, he'd make a big pot of spaghetti and eat the same food four days straight. `` God's Love saved my life, because I did n't want to eat. It's really the high point of my day.

 What started as a small, ridiculed but exuberant religious experience in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> around the start of the century has swelled into a worldwide Christian phenomenon. Called the Pentecostal or charismatic movement, it is one of the fastest growing forces in modern church life, spawning young denominations and stimulating old ones. `` There is no question but that it is revitalizing Christianity across the world, particularly the older forms of Christianity,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, a top authority on religious demographics. A large, influential branch of that movement in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the Assemblies of God, marks its 75th anniversary at its convention Aug. 8-13 in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, bustling and confident. `` God has been very good to us and we're grateful for it,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, the denomination's general superintendent `` There is enthusiasm, growth, awakening everythere,'' he added in a telephone interview. `` We feel the future is very bright. And that's not just puff.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, a British Anglican, editor of the World Christian Encyclopedia, now working for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the world's Pentecostals-charismatics total 353 million. That includes 184 million Pentecostal church members, 23 million of them in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; 133 million `` charismatics'' in mainline churches, 44 million in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, and 30 million `` third wave'' renewalists, 12 million in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` It's happening on a vast scale,'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The movement has a strong moral and ethical side. From every point of view, it's a major and positive development.'' The Assemblies of God, with more than 2.1 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adherents, has grown 66 percent in the last decade from just under 1.3 million, putting it among the nation's 10 largest Protestant denominations. Its missionaries have planted overseas branches, totaling an additional 16.2 million. With headquarters in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, it has 18 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges, including a seminary, and runs several health-care facilities. Its Gospel Publishing House turns out an average of 24 tons of religious literature a day. In surmounting the downfall in sex scandals of two of its prominent TV ministers, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, the denomination gained widened respect for its principled handling of the matter. It firmly revoked ministerial credentials when disciplines were rejected, although in doing so it gave up large revenues, including $ 12 million annually from <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s former ministry. But supportive `` response has been far greater,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said, noting that contributions to worldwide ministries were up 9.9 percent to $ 284 million for the last biennium. `` We made our decision, not on the basis of money, but on the basis of what Scripture teaches,'' he said. `` I've been so grateful that we've heard from many denominational leaders in appreciation for our reinforcing the credibility of the church in the world.'' While the Assemblies of God has kept growing, in contrast to mainline membership declines, the gains have slackened lately. `` There are ebbs and flows,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. Asked if the denomination at its 75-year mark might be succumbing to institutional cumbersomeness, sapping its initial spontaneity and enthusiasm, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said: `` I do n't think so. We keep talking about that, warning against it and listening to the counsel of the word of God, reminding the church not to lose the fervor that the Holy Spirit loosed in it.'' The <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> convention is to launch the denomination's most ambitious evangelism program, `` Decade of Harvest.'' It envisions winning 5 million people to Christ, opening 5,000 new churches, and training 20,000 new ministers in the next decade, with 1 million `` prayer partners'' praying daily for it. `` We've tried to keep evangelism alive,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. `` A lot of people think that glossolalia -LRB- speaking in ` tongues' -RRB- is our main doctrine, but it's not. Rather it's the message of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s salvation He meets the needs of humanity.'' However, speaking or singing in `` unknown tongues'' is a hallmark of the Assemblies of God and other Pentecostals as well as the charismatic incursion in mainline Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Founded at a convention in <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, in 1914, the Assemblies of God stemmed from heightened spiritual experiences in small groups across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, beginning in 1901. Other Pentecostal denominations also arose from the tongues-speaking revival, sometimes ridiculed as `` holy rollers.'' But that changed as the denomination matured, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. `` We've moved across the tracks. Our congregations build nicer buildings, and we reach into the upper middle class.'' Tongues-speaking, considered a sign of baptism by the Holy Spirit, derives from apostolic times, first experienced 50 days after Christ's resurrection at <LOCATION> Pentecost </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and described in early Christian congregations. Historic churches shunned such practices, contending they ended with apostolic times, but such experiences have spread through Protestantism and Catholicism as the `` charismatic movement.'' `` It has touched most mainline denominations,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. `` It's had a great deal of impact.''

<HEAD>Postal Service Edges Into World of Marketing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Move over <ORGANIZATION> Topps </ORGANIZATION> _ you have new competition. But the baseball cards being marketed by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service to promote stamp sales wo n't have the trademark piece of bubble gum inside. The post office is easing into the card business with just four of the popular collectibles as part of a push to shift from the image of a neighborhood store into a modern marketing machine. Probably the most visible effort in this change will come in September, in a joint campaign promoting postage stamps featuring dinosaurs in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s home video release of the movie `` The Land Before Time.'' But this is n't the first tie-in between stamps and other businesses, and it wo n't be the last, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON>, assistant postmaster general for philatelic and retail services. The baseball cards, for example, take advantage of previously issued stamps honoring popular ballplayers. The stamps featuring <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gherig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Babe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> have been combined in a new albumn, with four matching baseball cards included. Last year a set of stamps featuring carousel animals got special promotions at several amusement parks around the country, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. And the agency is interested in future arrangements, perhaps for planned stamps featuring lighthouses and marine mammals. And new stamps often receive special promotions when issued, often organized by local post offices. For example the Key West, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, office prepared a special 12 - by 16-inch print of the recent Hemingway stamp in the Literary Arts series Mounted on a backing with a copy of the stamp canceled on July 17, its first day of issue, the print is being offered for $ 25, by mail order, to collectors and <LOCATION> Hemingway </LOCATION> fans. But the arrangement with <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s film about dinosaurs is the most ambitious effort so far in the effort to boost sales of stamps to collectors. Buyers of the home video will receive a little brochure advertising the dinosaur stamps, offering for sale a T-shirt featuring one of the stamps, and also promoting holiday seals sold by the movie company and a special deal from Pizza Hut. The dinosaur stamps should appeal to youngsters, the T-shirts and posters to both youngsters and slightly older people, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. With the movie going on sale in September, the promotion arrives just in time for Stamp Collecting Month, which the post office celebrates in October. The purpose of the effort is simple: getting people interested in collecting stamps, a hobby that means big bucks for an agency struggling to cover its ever increasing costs while avoiding raising postage rates. Those little piles of stamps `` collected'' in envelopes and desk drawers across the nation may seem like a small investment to their owners. But to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service, collectors represent $ 150 million to $ 170 million in sales annually, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. And the best part is, it's virtually all profit. A postage stamp is, after all, nothing more than a receipt for advance payment for a service _ the delivery of a letter or parcel. When people collect new stamps and save them, the post office gets its quarter but does n't have to perform any service for the money. That's the kind of business most companies would love to have, and one the post office is happy to encourage. It should please non-collectors, too, since the profits from stamps sold to collectors _ philatelists is the formal term _ helps subsidize the postal service and thus lowers the costs to people who use stamps to get letters delivered somewhere. Since stamps were first issued in the mid-1800s, the postal service has enjoyed the fact that people collect stamps, occasionally seeing a boost when some collector became famous, such as President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. But only in recent years has it studied them and sought to increase the market. Who collects stamps? Well, 75 percent of youngsters have a collection of some type, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, manager of philatelic services at the postal service. As youngsters enter their teens they find other interests, Ms. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said, and the stamp collection usually gets put aside until later in life when they marry, have families, and often get interested in stamps again. It was the nostalgic folks returning to collecting that made last year's carousel stamps big sellers, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. This returning group is about half `` casual'' collectors, who buy stamps they like from time to time, but do n't make a big deal out of it. One-fourth are `` accumulators'' who have some stamps, often ripping used ones off envelopes. And the rest are serious collectors, buying whole sheets of stamps, subscribing to stamp publications and following the hobby closely. The serious collectors lobby the agency for stamps, but Ms. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said officials seek to please all types of collectors. One thing they have in common is that everybody likes pretty stamps, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said, although serious collectors lean toward more formal engravings while casual collectors seem to prefer more colorful productions. Much of the recent marketing efforts is aimed at converting casual collectors to serious ones _ explaining how to mount stamps in albums, organize them by theme and so forth. To do this <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> has instituted a quarterly series of `` stamp packs'' including a brochure and all of the colorful commemorative stamps issued over three months. Previously, sets of stamps were issued just once a year, but the stamp packs four times annually help spread out the interest, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. In addition, the agency has subscription services for stamp collectors to make sure they get all the new stamps that come out. There are 38,000 Benjamin Franklin Stamp Clubs for youngsters around the country, encouraged by the postal service as a means of getting youngsters interested in stamp collecting. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> has branched out postal marketing in other areas, too, promoting the sale of stamps in shopping malls and supermarkets, for example. Those sales have grown to $ 500 million, and `` the public just loves it,'' he said. People find it more convenient to buy stamps in supermarkets, he explained, and this also shortens the lines at post offices, improving service for people who need help from clerks. Shopping mall operations are being planned where people can `` shop and ship,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> added. Similar to the postal substations run by many small town stores, these operations would allow shoppers to buy something at a store, have it wrapped, and then take it to a counter in the mall for mailing to a friend or relative without having to make a special trip to a post office.

<HEAD>Historians on Nixon's Resignation: It Hurt, But Ultimately Helped</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fifteen years after <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned as president to avoid the disgrace of removal from office, historians and political observers say the republic paid a price but ultimately benefited from the ordeal. And, they say, the impact of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s crisis has been felt by every president who followed him; chief executives since <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> have been more cautious, candid and constrained. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON>, who served as an adviser to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, says that in retrospect <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s resignation was `` wholesome. Political scientist <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, author of `` Managing the Presidency,'' says the experience left <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s successors `` pretty skittish for a while.'' He thinks <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, for one, overreacted and was too weak. Historian <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkendall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> says that while the event damaged the presidency, `` it would have left us with more serious problems if <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had been able to get away with it.'' Political scientist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> says the founding fathers `` pretty clearly expected that the impeachment process would be used more often than it has.'' He says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` has been intruding on executive functions'' since it found the strength in 1974 to move toward the removal of a president. A dissent comes, however, from <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>, who served as White House counselor to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. He says the near-impeachment of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was unforunate. `` There are other political remedies which are more routine and which can make presidents toe the mark and put the fear of God in them if they're over-reaching,'' <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> contends. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, can deny funds for presidential projects. `` Congress can so fix his clock that he ca n't do anything,'' <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON>, however, says <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s continued tenure in office `` was having an adverse effect on the morale of the country and its status around the world. It could have led to a threatening international incident. We did not have a president who was actively governing.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, he says, was concerned solely with his own survival that summer 15 years ago. On the night of Aug. 8, 1974, a few days after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had recommended impeachment, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> went on television to announce that he would resign, becoming the first and only president to have done so. He said he no longer had `` a strong enough political base in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' to carry out the duties of office. Three days earlier, he had surrendered the `` smoking gun'' Watergate tape. It revealed that within a week of the break-in at <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at the Watergate in 1972, he had ordered an end to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation. Whatever remaining support <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> collapsed. The morning after <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s speech, he resigned in a letter to the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, and Vice President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> took the oath. `` Our Constitution works,'' the new president said. `` Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men.'' With the passage of time, a sampling of historians and political observers shows agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s assessment and these two points: _ Under the circumstances, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s resignation was healthy for the country _ The impact on <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s successors has been to curtail presidential adventurism, to check the strong-president, weak-Congress trend that started with <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and to promote presidential candor and accountability `` I think the initial effect was to make presidents much more sensitive to the concerns of the public,'' said <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON>, the ex-Ford adviser. `` That was true of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. It began to slip at the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration or we would n't have had the Iran-Contra affair.'' But even in the Iran-Contra affair, noted <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, director of governmental studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, the record shows that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s people used the word `` impeachment'' when discussing the possible consequences of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra-funding activities. It is important that they were sensitive to the possibility of impeachment, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said, adding: `` The legacy of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> assures us that some warning signals are present for successive presidents.'' `` Even a strong president like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> found himself substantially constrained by an active <PERSON> Congres </PERSON> and a whole new set of statutes restricting presidential power,'' he said. Watergate resulted in laws in these areas _ freedom of information, limits on presidential war-making powers and a president's ability to impound funds appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and limits on campaign contributions. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political scientist, said he finds it `` almost alarming that it came to the point that we almost had to do the same thing with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' He said the president's age, his popularity and his nearness to finishing his term saved <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from an impeachment attempt, but he finds <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s escape worrisome, `` very seriously damaging to the fiber of the republic.'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON>, chairman of the political science department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said the difference between Watergate and Iran-Contra is that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> knew what was happening while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` always denied that he knew what was going on.'' As for whether the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> experience was good for the country, <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON> said it is never good to have a law-breaking president `` but it was a wonderful thing that our system of justice and separation of powers worked to remove a president without an assassination or violence of any kind.'' With the exception of <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> _ who said `` we will never know'' _ the experts interviewed agreed <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> could not have avoided removal from office had he not resigned. At the time he quit, every member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had announced support for his impeachment by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and even such staunch supporters as Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., had warned <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> he could not win in a trial by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` People had had it with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and were finally ready to listen to the evidence,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` There's no question he would have been impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have convicted him,'' said <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kirkendall </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s conduct in office shows that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has learned Watergate's lesson. He noted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> consults conspicuously with congressional leaders and allies before making major moves. `` He makes a big thing of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and others have learned `` that you ca n't get away with anything. Sooner or later, truth will out. And the truth shows that if you violated the law, you will take the consequences.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> was looking for a new acting experience when he accepted the lead role in the mind-bending thriller `` Breaking Point'' on cable television. He plays a World War II <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intelligence officer whose capture just weeks before D-Day gives the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> an opportunity to pry out the invasion secrets in a most diabolical and deceptive manner. `` Breaking Point'' gets its first showing on <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> on Friday and will be repeated Saturday and Sunday. It's a remake of the 1964 film starring <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> `` I did it like an <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> movie or something from the ` Twilight Zone,''' says <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, who stars regularly as lawyer <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' `` That's what drew me to it. I've always wanted to do something in that genre. Since it's for cable we took risks. The wonderful thing is that after it's approved they leave the artists alone to do their work. It's not as pat as regular television. The experience was that of doing a feature film. I wanted to experience what my character feels, the pain, the torture, the freedom, and to be able to have the audience feel it, too.'' He plays Maj. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, who is abducted by the Germans, tortured briefly and wakes to find the war is over and he's in an American hospital. Or so he's led to believe. It's a plot to learn the secrets of D-Day. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> is the `` American'' doctor and <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacula </PERSON> is the nurse he falls in love with after being told his wife has died. `` We filmed the exteriors at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. There's a wonderful old school and a retreat that looks like an Alpine chalet. When I first read the script I said, ` Great, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. I can take my son to meet his grandparents,''' said <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, whose wife is English actress <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pays </PERSON>. `` Well, we filmed <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Markle </PERSON> directed, and it has some interesting camera work. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> and I had a great relationship and I think our scenes are well written and work well. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>'s led to believe the war's over and he talks about the coming invasion of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> Then he finds out he's been deceived and he hatches his own deception.'' <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> did get to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, however. He and his wife spent a month traveling with their four-month-old son <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. `` Breaking Point'' is <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>'s first movie for cable. His feature film work in a busy schedule in the past few years included `` Major League,'' `` Disorganized Crime,'' `` <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigby </PERSON>, You're a Fool'' and `` Hello, Again.'' <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> said he would talk soon to the producers of `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law'' to see what would happen to <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> next season. `` I know what needs to be done,'' he said. `` He needs some re-evaluation. <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> has n't quite figured it out. All life has to reproduce but <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON>'s caught in a cycle of refusing to commit himself. He has n't grown up enough to accept the moral conventions. The thing that I put into <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> is that he senses something is missing. I do n't think I could play a character who does n't recognize it `` I think <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> is terrified of marriage. As a divorce lawyer he knows all the built-in problems. I think he also sees it as a progression toward death. He's trying to hold onto his youth.'' He said one of the advantages of doing `` Breaking Point'' is that <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> is so different from <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON>. `` It's good to do a character who has his values and his loyalties straight,'' he said. `` After ` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,' I'd like to do more features. I'll have had seven years of a family and a house and a base. I think it'd be fun to live and work other places in the world. I'd like to base myself in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for a while. I could travel and spend time with my wife and son.'' <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. His father, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> is a former agent and now a producer. His mother, actress <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, has been on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> soap opera `` The Young and the Restless'' for the past 15 years. He said he occasionally works with his father in developing projects. `` I'm working on an idea for a stage musical and I have an idea for a series for <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> and myself.''

 It is not uncommon for <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the eight-time world champion calf roper, to have a Lear jet waiting _ motor running _ to take him from rodeo to rodeo. `` No one has an earthly idea what it's like to rope at <LOCATION> Pecos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, at 8 a.m., <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> -LRB- Ariz. -RRB- at 2 p.m., <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> -RRB- at 9 p.m. and the next morning at <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION> -LRB- Ark. -RRB-,'' said the 33-year-old guru of calf ropers while competing at the 93rd annual <ORGANIZATION> Cheyenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> Days in late July. He was n't complaining. He was reveling. `` I'm the second man to win over a million dollars in my career,'' said the cowboy from <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, flashing a cereal-box smile and spitting a wad of chew. `` I'm a first-class cowboy. I want it good all the time. I like good horses, pretty women and old whiskey.'' And with little effort, he gets all three. But to the vast majority of cowboys on the professional rodeo circuit, life is an old pickup truck, an ace bandage and a cold beer to wash the trail dust down. `` We sleep in the back seat of the pickup, mostly,'' said steer wrestler <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 27, who grew up on a ranch in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` There's lots of times you just want to be home.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is traveling the circuit with three cowboys from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The week before <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>'s `` Daddy of ` Em All,'' the group had competed at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. With a 6.5-second time early in the week at <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> qualified for the Sunday finals. But there was no time for rest in the Cowboy State while waiting for the finals. By the end of the week, he had competed in rodeos in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Glasglow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, before returning to <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>. `` There's a misconception of rodeo cowboys. Everybody thinks we drink a lot and raise a lot of heck,'' he said, while feeding his horse, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>. `` It's not that way anymore. We go to too many rodeos. We spend more time traveling than anything.'' Last year, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s second year of professional rodeo, the Top 20 bull dogger entered 123 rodeos in a 270-day stretch, all the while nursing a wounded shoulder. `` You have to have some mental preparation,'' he said. `` You have to fool yourself and say ` I feel good, I'm not tired' when you are tired and you do n't feel good.'' He does it for one reason _ to get to the National Finals Rodeo held each year in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Only the top 15 in each event qualify for the finals. Last year, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was 16th. `` If someone asked me that day if I wanted to go to a rodeo, I would have slugged him,'' he said. `` It's hard to put that effort out and not qualify.'' For weekend cowboys, however, the pressure to win is not as intense because the financial security of a working ranch back home keeps them afloat. `` I've got the best of both,'' said 67-year-old calf roper <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillard </PERSON>, who owns a sheep ranch in <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. `` We can go home and rest up. And it's just fine to participate once in a while.'' <PERSON> Tillard </PERSON> has been roping since he entered competitions at the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> State Fair when he was 6. Sixty-one years later, he has two sons who rope, often in the same rodeos, and grandchildren who are already roping haystacks. <PERSON> Tillard </PERSON> says he's happy with his life and never considered trading it for that of a full-time cowboy. `` All they've got on their mind is roping. I'm calling home and saying, ` Did they get the hay in?''' he said, leaning against a corral while awaiting his turn to compete. `` Those guys get to traveling night and day. They forget they've got a wife and pretty soon they've got another one.'' For many, roping becomes an addiction and priorities are left in the dust. `` I know cowboys who have roped their ranch away,'' <PERSON> Tillard </PERSON> said. `` It gets pretty desperate sometimes. These guys do n't have any money and they go on the road. They win a little, and by the end of the year they're broke.'' But for rookie <PERSON> Dano </PERSON> <PERSON> Spradlin </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, the life of a cowboy is the life of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who, incidently, is writing a book tentatively titled `` Fast Times or Victim of Success.'' `` It's a kind of an unexplained desire,'' said the 26-year-old who has been on the back of only 18 bucking saddle broncs. `` My parents are kind of against it. They think the sport is history.'' <PERSON> Spradlin </PERSON> wrapped a bandage around his midsection, favoring a back injury from a bad ride, before his last ride at <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>. `` You think about riding correctly, being strong, getting psyched up _ like a boxer would,'' he said. `` You think about winning, but most of all, staying on.'' The young cowboy was bucked off both saddle broncs in the <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> competition. `` It's discouraging enough to make you want to get on again,'' he said. `` A lot of guys get a real nice buckle and lots of money _ I'm just doing it for a good time. I got the fever.''

<HEAD>Congress Considering New Flexibility for Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As lawmakers turn their attention to drafting a new farm bill, one of the most widely discussed topics on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is giving more `` flexibility'' to farmers. It's an idea that Republicans and Democrats seem to agree on _ at least in principle _ and one that could prove especially alluring to a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seeking ways to cut federal spending. `` The truth is, our farmers need to be able to produce according to farm income, consumer needs and environmental concerns rather than demands from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> recently told a congressional committee. Although many in agriculture share that goal, there is certainly no consensus on how to accomplish it. From the farmer's standpoint, the problem is vexing. Producers have long complained that government commodity programs largely prevent them from varying their cropping plans, whether it's to take advantage of market demands for a commodity or to experiment with non-traditional crops. Under current programs, farmers have a `` base acreage'' for traditional crops such as wheat and feed grains that qualify for federal subsidies. Farmers risk reducing that base and the potential for federal subsidies in future years if they substitute another commodity on some of that land. In the simplest form, proposals for greater flexibility would merely allow farmers to substitute crops on some of their base acres without any risk of a reduction in future federal farm payments. Lawmakers took a step in that direction in a drought relief package passed by the House. The measure would allow farmers to plant up to 20 percent of their permitted acreage with alternative crops, including sunflowers, canola, rapeseed and crambe. But in the early debate over the 1990 farm bill, more extensive proposals have been suggested. One of the most prominent is called the `` triple base'' plan. `` The idea of paying farmers on a reduced percentage of the land they usually plant _ their crop acreage bases _ has at least two major attractions for policy-makers,'' concluded a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would help shrink government spending on agriculture, but, unlike lower target prices, the reduction would not necessarily amount to a dollar-for-dollar cut in farm income, as farmers would still be able to raise other crops on their unpaid permitted acres.'' Under a triple base plan, farmers would continue to have an overall acreage base if they participated in government commodity programs, such as for wheat or corn. As with current programs, a percentage of land must be taken out of production each year in order to receive government price and income supports. The new twist, however, is that a percentage of a farmer's overall base acreage could be planted in other crops that would not be eligible for federal subsidies. Consider the example of a farmer with a wheat base of 100 acres. The government could require the producer to idle or set aside 10 percent for conservation purposes _ the first base. The government would pay subsidies for a portion of the acres, 80 percent, for instance _ the second base. On the remainder _ the third base _ the producer could grow a crop to sell on the open market. Proponents say that although farmers would receive smaller government subsidy payments than under current programs, they could partially offset those reductions by selling crops on the market from the `` third base'' acres. `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> would be able to demonstrate budget savings, just as though target prices had been reduced, but farmers presumably would not suffer the same loss in income,'' the study said. Target prices are a government-fixed rate that helps determine the amount of direct income supports received by farmers. However, a number of farm groups have voiced opposition to the triple-base plan. Critics say it is not sound agricultural policy but just an indirect way for lawmakers to cut farm-support spending. Commodity groups also have argued that not all farmers can profitably grow more than one crop and they express doubts that the triple-base option would do much to encourage producers to raise crops that are in short supply, such as oats currently. A study earlier this year by the Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a group associated with <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION>, found that with each $ 1 drop in government spending under a triple-base plan, farmers would suffer an 85 - to 90-cent drop in `` net returns. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> has recommended a different approach _ called a `` total farm base'' program _ but one aimed at the same flexibility goal. Under it, the total acreage bases of all crops subject to government commodity programs would be counted together for each farmer. A farmer would be required to idle a portion of the total farm base, which would provide the government with a tool to continue to control overall production, but then could plant any mix of crops. `` If our farmers had flexibility ... to plant and produce for the market instead of for government programs, we'd all be better served,'' says <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>.

 `` Salaam Bombay!'' -LRB- Virgin Vision, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, English subtitles. VHS-Beta, $ 79.95 -RRB- `` Salaam Bombay!'' is a heartrending look at the homeless street children of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. But its meanings and nuances transcend that exotic locale. The film, which won a number of international film awards in 1988, is a riveting portrayal of how 20th century societies, including so-called civilized ones, are devouring their young, alternately selling them, or selling them short. Producer-director <PERSON> Mira </PERSON> <PERSON> Nair </PERSON> traveled the streets of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, fascinated by the resilience of the thousands of children who survive by their wits in a squalid world of dirt, drugs and prostitution. She decided to tell their story, not with actors, but with children she gathered from those very backstreets. `` Salaam Bombay!'' is the story of 10-year-old <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON>. Abandoned first by his mother, then by the traveling circus he joins, he travels to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> hoping to earn 500 rupees to take back to his mother. <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> acquires street wisdom and a toughness that even leads to a murder. But somehow, almost miraculously, he keeps a child-like empathy even as he is failing in his own hopes. He befriends a desperate drug addict, and comforts an abject 16-year-old sold by her own mother to a brothel. The film's producers decided to use proceeds to establish learning centers for the street children of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` Salaam Bombay!'' is not rated. It has no objectionable language or sexual encounters, but the themes of street life are nonetheless unvarnished. It is a truly exceptional film. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Crusoe'' -LRB- Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated PG-13. -RRB- `` Crusoe,'' based on the tale of a shipwreck on a tropical island, is a lush and aesthetically pleasing movie, and as ripe with moral dilemmas as the burdened coconut trees swaying on the beach. In `` Crusoe,'' values come crashing down and savagely splinter the beliefs of the movie's star, <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> plays a greedy young 19th-century slave trader who tempts fate by taking one final and risky expedition to round up more blacks from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But his ship becomes ensnared in a vicious autumn storm and all aboard perish, except for <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who winds up sprawled on a desolate beach. <PERSON> Crusoe </PERSON> learns to endure the solitude and fashions a comfortable shelter for himself on the picturesque island. Before long his isolation is interrupted by visiting natives. He rescues one from a human sacrifice and decides to keep him as a slave. But the native later escapes and is killed. In a provocative twist, <PERSON> Crusoe </PERSON> becomes the hunted and is trapped by another islander. But the two men reach an accord and build something of a friendship. The film's ending is the final test of <PERSON> Crusoe </PERSON>'s new respect for the man he once wanted to enslave. Director <PERSON> Caleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Deschanel </PERSON> so effectively captures the panoramic beauty of the island setting _ with its creamy white sand beaches, dense verdant forests and crystal blue tide pools _ one can almost taste the salt spray in the breeze. There also is very little dialogue, but the engrossing visuals and the moral struggles make for compelling viewing. _ By <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibby </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Thrilled to Death'' -LRB- Republic. VHS-Beta, $ 79.95. Rated R -RRB- B-movie fans, beware. `` Thrilled to Death'' is an A, as in absolutely awful. The script is bad, the acting terrible and even the filming is poor with washed-out colors and fuzziness. It's a movie that uses the backdrop of a swingers' club to unravel a tale of murder and drug dealing. Along the way, there's some nudity, strong language and graphic violence Two couples meet and become friends. But one couple has set up the other to take a fall in a drug-and-murder doublecross. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> play a mystery novelist and his wife; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> are the bad guys. _ By <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 When <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> filmed scenes for his new movie `` Cookie'' at Sing Sing, it marked a sentimental return. Not that he was ever a guest at the legendary slammer. He grew up in <LOCATION> Ossining </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Yeah, I remember Sing Sing,'' he reflected. `` As a kid, I used to go into the prison because the town's basketball team played the prisoners. A lot of the kids I went to school with, their fathers were guards there. `` Whenever you mentioned to people that you came from <LOCATION> Ossining </LOCATION>, they always had the same question: Do the lights go out when they electrocute somebody? Of course the lights never dimmed. You were not aware of the prison as an ominous thing. `` The major memory about Sing Sing had to do with the one big escape when I was in high school. Three guys broke out and went down to the river by the railroad station and got ahold of a boat. One local cop was shot on the way down, and one of the convicts was shot. They actually rowed across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, and they were picked up on the Palisades across the way. That was a big thing.'' In the new <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release, `` Cookie,'' <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> is mobster <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Capino </PERSON> who is about to be sprung after 13 years in Sing Sing. His teen-age daughter, played with amazing skill by English actress <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, comes to visit him. She is resentful, since he has n't married her mother -LRB- <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiest </PERSON> -RRB- He already has a wife -LRB- <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaccaro </PERSON> -RRB-. As you might guess, `` Cookie'' is not `` The Godfather III.'' After his long service as TV's slovenly gumshoe, Columbo, <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> is on the other side of the law. That's were he started in movies. `` It was nice being a mob guy again,'' he remarked. `` It was nice looking good, too. Great suits they gave me. Did I look good? I thought I did.'' However, he would brook no criticism of his Columbo raincoat, which is still in action after 18 years. `` You know my first picture was ` Murder, Incorporated' in 1960? I made a little splash in that,'' he said. `` I played <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reles </PERSON>, who was part of that <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> mob that operated out of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> at that time. They were the first ones who hired themselves out to kill people. They were all quite crazy. <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> was probably the craziest. `` Those mob guys when they saw that picture, they went for it. They liked me. They came around, and I spent some time with them. I had a real interest in those guys _ I think everybody does. `` I remember going around with some cops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They were mostly involved in drug cases, but they also had some wire taps of mob guys. I wan na tell ya, if I had those tapes here and could play'em for ya, you'd roll on the floor. There are no funnier conversations I ever heard in my life.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> may sound like a street guy, but he has a bachelor's degree in political science from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> He was studying for his master's at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when he dropped out to try acting. `` When I started out, I was 25-26 years old in off-Broadway in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Like most actors I knew at that time, we all wanted the same thing: to be in the Actors Studio. We thought that was heaven on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` I never thought about being in movies, I never thought about being in television. I just wanted to be a stage actor. I remember this agent _ I've told the story before _ the guy said to me, ` You know, you wo n't be able to do TV or movies.' I do n't know why, but that did n't make any difference to me. Because I had never considered doing TV or movies. `` I asked what he was talking about, and he said, ` Your glass eye.''' <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> lost his eye when he was 3. He won an Academy nomination for his supporting performance in `` Murder, Incorporated,'' and he has been working in films and television ever since. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> won three Emmy awards for his portrayal of Lt. Columbo during its 1971-1977 run on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. Last season, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> installed `` Columbo'' as part of its `` ABC Mystery Movie,'' much to <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>'s delight The show has been renewed for 1989-90, and he hopes to play the role for years to come. `` I'll play him as long as the people want to see him,'' he said. `` I think it would terrific to grow old as <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON>. If Columbo really ca n't hear -LRB- chuckling -RRB- ... and Columbo really ca n't see -LRB- more chuckles -RRB- ... and he gets to the point where it takes him an hour to get into the office I think that would be hilarious. `` I'd like to see him saying, ` What's my name?' -LRB- laughing -RRB- ` Did you murder someone?' ` What case IS this? I got ta call the office and find out.'''

<TEXT>
 `` The Floating World,'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON>'s first novel, is best read on a window seat of a Greyhound bus. Names and places speed by. Friendships form quickly. Departures come with little warning. Through Olivia, the book's young narrator, <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON> evokes a life of gas stations and motels, wrecked cars and part-time jobs. A world where a marriage of 10 years is treated with disbelief and some disdain, where no place is like home. `` Sometimes when I'm on a Greyhound bus I think this is where I belong,'' the author explained. `` I've never spent a year somewhere and said, ` This is it.' I have n't really got off that bus, but I'd like to. As a child, <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON> was shocked to learn that her classmates had assigned bedtimes. There were few rules in her house, little routine at all. She was born in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but soon lived in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. By age nine, her parents were divorced and she had returned to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with her mother, sister and brother. <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON> now lives in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, but feels restless, suspicious of setting down roots. `` The Floating World'' -LRB- $ 17.95, Viking -RRB- is not autobiographical, <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON> insists, despite the book's story of <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>'s experiences as she moves across the country during the 1950s and'60s. What `` The Floating World'' does capture, however, is the feelings brought on by constant upheaval. `` Even today I sometimes feel I do n't know where I belong,'' the author said. `` Too bad. A lot of times I would like having a feeling of belonging but I like traveling, too.'' She writes from the perspective of a second-generation Japanese-American whose father was interned in prison camp during World War II, and who learned quickly how fragile the allegiances of family and neighborhood could be. `` It was really upsetting,'' she said of her father's experience `` The thing is that I know it will never happen to me. Yet because it happened to my father, I'm less sure of my place in the world.'' <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON> first wanted to be a journalist, but a few years after graduating from college she began writing short stories. She's been published in The New Yorker, Grand Street and The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Review. `` With fiction, you can change the facts to reveal a larger truth; that's the root of fiction. That's the problem I have with nonfiction. I would be so tempted to tell a lie because it would tell the story better. That's what makes nonfiction so great, too _ all the tension.'' At the start of World War II, when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' bitter enemy, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>'s grandparents are forced to give their children American names such as <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lily </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> The tradition is passed on to <LOCATION> Olivia </LOCATION> and her siblings _ <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>. `` When I read on the cover of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, ` Are the Japanese being unfair?,' I kind of think people are going to be mad at me,'' <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON> said. `` I do have that sort of identification. It's hard because I look Japanese, whereas somebody whose parents came over from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, no one would think of ascociating him that closely with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON>'s infuences, however, are profoundly American. She draws on the Southern writer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>'s feelings of restlessness and chaos, and uses the spare language of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. And, like <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, she is fascinated with the blurring of myth and reality. As <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> rides through <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, a hitchhiker appears and quickly vanishes. <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON> also writes of an encounter between <LOCATION> Olivia </LOCATION> and a friend of her stepfather's: `` ` See my house?' he said. ` It's an illusion, it's not really there.' `` I looked at the house. Surrounded by dark and trees and below an orange-ringed moon, it did not seem quite real. That's what I thought he meant.'' The author explained: `` I wanted some things to be fantastical. That's a lot like me. I daydream a lot. It's kind of like the saying about magic, it's true if you believe it and it's not true if you do n't believe it.'' After <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>, the narrator of `` The Floating World,'' graduates from high school, she moves to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which had a mythic hold on <PERSON> Kadohata </PERSON> and many Americans as the symbol of a better life. `` When we first moved there,'' she recalled, `` we were in a truck with my mother's boyfriend and we had driven across country.

 Twenty-two years after they began, 14 years after they broke off and 20 years after they played at <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, Ten Years After is back together. A <ORGANIZATION> Chrysalis </ORGANIZATION> album, `` About Time,'' will be released in August, 15 years after their last one, and a seven-week fall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour is planned. The quartet, one of the major bands to emerge from the 1960s blues revival in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, known for its fast and furious blend of blues and medium-heavy rock, has not mellowed out. Guitarist-vocalist <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has been performing, while bassist <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, keyboardist <PERSON> Chick </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> have stayed in music, producing, engineering and managing. In an interview with <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said that the band did n't so much split as wind down. `` We'd had some degree of success and we'd all got nice houses and families. There was a bit of pressure to stay at home.'' He said that before Ten Years After split, `` Critics said I was a fast, tasteless guitar player. That was bothering me a bit. I should n't have let it, now I realize.'' So he put together the seven-piece In Flight. `` Critics said it was wonderful and I was playing better than ever. I missed the roar of the crowd and the loudness after a while. That band was n't capable of playing heavy rock I went back to playing from my blues and rock roots.'' He formed Ten Years Later for a year, then <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and Company, which played some Ten Years After favorites. `` When we played together last summer, suddenly it sounded like Ten Years After, right from the first note. It was obvious Ten Years After had its own sound,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. Reception at the festivals was so enthusiastic, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said, that the four decided to stay together. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, each working with other people, wrote 40 songs. The band recorded 15. Unable to decide on 10, they put 11 on `` About Time.'' In July, Ten Years After played before 80,000 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Asked about <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, which took place 20 years ago on a farm in <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, on Aug. 15, 16 and 17, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> says, `` It's all a bit hazy now, to be honest.'' Still, memories come back. `` We were set to go on and a thunderstorm appeared,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` Nobody could play for two or three hours. Sparks were flying on the stage. I thought it outdid the music by far. God's light show. `` In a way it was fortunate. I went for a walk around the lake and joined in with the audience. Nobody knew I was one of the musicians. Half a million people ca n't all run under trees. They sat there and started singing. People were playing on mud slides. It was a wonderful thing to see that happening. Everybody was making the best out of the ridiculous sitation. I think it brought the best out of everybody. `` People were offering food and drink. It was very idealistic, very nice. I think had it not been for the storm, probably I would never have seen much. `` One of the reasons I went out was because in the backstage area there was n't a single cigarette. I came back with 10 marijuana cigarettes, no regular cigarettes.'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said, `` They said the food backstage was spiked with acid. Whether it was true or not, it dims the appetite. The drinks were supposed to be dodgy. In those days you never used to drink from an open can anyhow.'' Neither can remember what Ten Years After played, except for `` I'm Going Home,'' the high-energy rocker used in the `` Woodstock'' movie and, they think, the jazzy `` I Ca n't Keep From Crying Sometimes'' and `` Love Like a Man.'' `` I remember we did ` Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl,''' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said, `` because the tuning went out because of atmospheric conditions. We had to stop the song, apologize and retune. We did ` Going Home' as an encore.'' `` We were the first on after the storm,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> recalled. `` Everybody was worried. Sparks were still flying off the stage and it was very wet. Somebody had to do it. Think how many of our records would have sold if we'd been electrocuted. `` It was definitely the movie that made <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> the memorable thing it was,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> was probably as good a festival as <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. It got forgotten. `` We carried on in 3,000 to 5,000-seat halls. A year later the movie came out and we're into 20,000 seaters.'' The night before their <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> appearance, Ten Years After was in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> at a jazz festival before a primarily black audience. `` <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> went on,'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. `` Four white hippies went on afterwards. When we walked on stage, an uproar was starting. It was frightening. But we played a bit of jazz and blues and we were OK then.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> sais that in one way <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> was a statement against racial prejudice. `` It was even more about the peace movement and the Vietnam War. We thought the peace movement was very real and a good thing to be doing. <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> tended to make it into a fashionable thing. The fashion grew old and it was no longer cool to be a hippie.'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> added, `` <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> was anti-establishment, a peace and love thing, anti-violence. It was for tolerance, let people do what they want, help one another. I think it had a lot of long-term benefits.'' But they did n't know what <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> symbolized before they got there. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said, `` It was just another line on the sheet.'' They flew from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and drove until they came to blocked roads. `` They took us in an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` I was hanging out on a safety strap over all the audience. It was a mind-blowing experience.''

<HEAD>Kodak Blames Restructuring for Second Quarter, Half-Year Earnings
Loss</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says its second-quarter profits fell 85 percent, mainly the result of a $ 225 million restructuring charge that was announced last week. Without the special charges, profits still would have dropped 26 percent in the second quarter. The company blames higher costs, including interest expenses and the impact of the strong dollar. Chairman <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> vowed last week and again Tuesday that strong steps would be taken to deal with the slump in operating profits. Nevertheless, the stock fell Tuesday. It was off 62 -LCB- cents at $ 47.50 in late trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Net earnings were $ 60 million, or 18 cents a share, down from a record $ 390 million, or $ 1.20 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to a record $ 4.5 billion from $ 4.13 billion for the second quarter last year. For the first half, profit fell 60 percent to $ 260 million, or 80 cents a share, from $ 650 million, or $ 2 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to a record $ 8.4 billion from $ 7.46 billion in last year's first half. The one-time charges cover changes that `` have happened, are happening and will be happening,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. He said the changes could involve layoffs, sale of businesses and discontinuation of products. But the company has not released details about its specific plans. `` That's what we're waiting for. There's been nothing concrete so far,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, stock analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the company has already made it clear that the current restructuring is not going to be major by Wall Street proportions. `` It's going to be significant, but not gigantic,'' <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said. `` But that leaves the question of whether the company is going to tighten its belt by one notch, two notches or three.'' `` While volume gains so far this year have been gratifying, especially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, our earnings have not kept pace,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. Some cost-cutting steps may be taken in the company's <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> business segment, which includes copiers, and microfilm and graphics equipment For the second quarter that segment posted a $ 144 million loss, as compared to a $ 92 million second-quarter profit last year. Even without restructuring charges, the segment would only have posted a profit of $ 6 million. `` There seems to be tremendous pressure there for something to happen,'' said <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>.

<HEAD>House Votes to Increase National Debt Ceiling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House has voted to increase the national debt limit temporarily by $ 70 billion so the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> wo n't go into default while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is on its summer recess. The bill, approved 231-185 Tuesday and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, adds to the debt ceiling of $ 2.8 trillion only through Oct. 31. By then, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hopes to complete work on bill boosting the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent borrowing authority to more than $ 3.1 trillion The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> is already bumping up against the $ 2.8 trillion limit and would be unable to meet its obligations by mid-August without additional power to issue debt. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government default would be unprecedented. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the short-term debt extension after blocking, 228-193, an attempt by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., to make the increase contingent upon <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> consideration of an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget The House actually approved the permanent debt increase when it passed the fiscal 1990 budget last spring, but the legislation has been held up in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Several senators plan to use the must-pass legislation to carry amendments addressing pet priorities, and it could also become the vehicle for a new deficit-reduction effort by congressional leaders and the White House. The national debt has tripled since the beginning of the decade due to the huge budget deficits of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> has been forced to borrow more and more money to finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts. The annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over $ 200 billion a year, but nearly $ 150 billion in red ink will be added to the pool this fiscal year. The Gramm-Rudman budget law, itself passed as part of a 1985 debt bill that first put the limit above $ 2 trillion, mandates that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president reduce the deficit in fiscal 1990 to $ 100 billion. Fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> commences its four-week summer recess this Saturday. The short-term debt limit bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday also included a provision, requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, to change the way the government accounts for its zero-coupon bonds when calculating the debt. The change will lessen the immediate impact the bonds have on the debt.

 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the conservative giant of Japanese industry, says it plans to drop special courtesy titles for employees and cut in half the number of approvals required for most decisions. The steps are part of a broad plan to make <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> more flexible and `` provide every employee the opportunity to work creatively and to the fullest of his or her ability,'' the company announced Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> also said it will spend $ 730 million on bettering employees' work lives, through new recreational facilities, dining rooms and company housing for both married and single employees. Aspects of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s plan such as more company housing are strictly Japanese, but the emphasis on employee creativity is Western. While American companies are trying to be more Japanese in management, the Japanese are trying in some respects to become more American. `` This is in order to have quick decisions and get more ideas, more energetic work from the staff,'' said <PERSON> Akikazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kida </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The changes were also announced in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. To promote workplace democracy, old titles such as kacho -LRB- manager -RRB- will be discarded and all employees will be referred to simply as san, the Japanese equivalent of Mr., Mrs. or Ms. Personnel evaluations that have been dominated by seniority will now take performance more into account, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> said. About 1,000 supervisors will be reassigned to creative, hands-on work. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> is the largest industrial company in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and has a reputation for a slow, conservative management style, in contrast to more Western-style companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Convictions Could Strengthen Use of Racketeering Statute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<UNK>AP Business Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The conviction of six Wall Street professionals on racketeering charges has intensified debate over whether the laws passed in 1970 to fight organized crime should be used to prosecute white-collar crime. Legal experts said Tuesday the guilty verdict on 63 of 64 counts in the Princeton-Newport tax fraud trial strengthens the government's decision to use the controversial Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. `` I think the verdict shows the statute can be used successfully in this area,'' said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a criminal law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would have expected it would be used more anyway and this verdict encourages it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial of five executives of the defunct investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> trader was the first time the statute was used in a securities case. Opponents of the law say applies far too stiff penalties for white-collar criminals _ including a 20-year jail term per count. They also say its provision for pretrial asset seizures can force companies out of business before a trial. `` I think RICO as originally promulgated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was excellent. I think it has become grossly overused and abused,'' said securities lawyer <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who represented a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader in another case stemming from the government's three-year crackdown on Wall Street crime Former <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, now running for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor, pioneered the new use of RICO _ and, critics say, threats to use it. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> was accused of trying to pressure the Princeton-Newport defendants to testify against others by charging them with racketeering. <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON> has said the charges last August forced its liquidation shortly thereafter. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> has said his firm agreed in a separate case to pay $ 650 million and plead guilty to six securities felonies rather than face a possible RICO indictment. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond operations, was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud earlier this year for transactions that included one also cited in the Princeton-Newport complaint after refusing to enter a plea agreement. A person familiar with his legal preparations said Tuesday the Princeton-Newport verdict would not affect <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s plans to fight the charges. But legal experts said Monday's guilty verdict would give prosecutors a psychological boost as they ready for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s scheduled March 1990 trial It also could spur more RICO securities cases. `` It certainly would indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> the viability of RICO at least before a jury and in a case where tax seemed to be the overriding concern,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> securities law professor <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmid </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> guidelines on RICO state the law should not be used as a substitute for tax fraud prosecutions. But the guidelines are flexible, and in the <LOCATION> Princeton-Newport </LOCATION> case tax claims were brought instead as mail fraud charges. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s, argues that the statute should not be used simply to fit the needs of prosecutors. `` It's not a substitute for the securities laws or the tax laws and it's not to be used as a catchall for every other federal statute,'' he said. Nevertheless, proponents of the law say its broad nature and the changing nature of crime, in which such frauds as insider trading have become more common, have made RICO a logical tool to fight any pattern of criminal activity. `` If the RICO statute can be used for three bookmakers standing on the corner it certainly ought to be used for individuals sitting in corporate boardrooms stealing massive amounts of money from the public,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstock </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering two bills that would revamp <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION>'s use in civil cases, eliminating its award of triple damages. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> in May called for imposing limitations on civil use of RICO. Others said RICO's severe potential penalties were inappropriate for cases such as Princeton-Newport. The jury, lawyers said, may have convicted the defendants of arranging illegal tax schemes with or without the RICO charge. `` My own view is that it's got to be an extremely aggravated white-collar case to use the RICO statute,'' said criminal defense lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON>. `` I do n't think it was originally designed for this use. I think it's very heavy-handed.''

<HEAD>Route 128's Woes: A Matter of Style As Well As Substance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Every morning, traffic moves at a crawl along Route 128, the high technology highway ringing <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Some insiders say the pace of business inside the sleek corporate headquarters along 128 is n't any faster. `` Tactical decisions that take six weeks in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> can take anywhere from six days to six nanoseconds in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, founder of a public relations firm that represents computer firms on both coasts. After a year of falling profits and employment, many companies along Route 128 are going through a period of painful retrenchment and self-examination, and a common conclusion is that they need to become more agile, less hierarchical and more willing to take risks. In the last week, three of the four largest computer makers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ announced quarterly losses. Prime's troubles have made it a takeover target, and two other <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> high-tech companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Cullinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apollo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ already have been sold this year. Another former high flyer, <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is in bankruptcy. All told, high technology manufacturing companies in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> have eliminated 7,300 jobs in the past year and 36,100 since their peak in December 1984, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> and Training says. Underlying Route 128's woes are the maturing of the computer industry, the slowdown in the national economy and the stiff competition that minicomputer makers face from workstations and ever more powerful personal computers. But those trends do not entirely explain why some <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> computer firms are still prospering, or why Route 128's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> counterpart, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, is generally healthy. The substance of Route 128's problem, critics charge, is style: Boston-area executives in their button-down shirts and brown shoes are more cautious and slow-moving than their <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rivals in polo shirts and Reeboks. `` In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies, the hierarchy seems compressed,'' said <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>. `` An account executive in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION> might be reporting directly to the president, the CEO or the founder. In <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, that person will speak to the communications manager, who works for the VP of you-name-it, who reports to the executive VP, who whispers to the Main Force.'' In part, <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said, the different management styles reflect cultural or lifestyle differences. In part, they are a matter of age. `` The high-tech superstructure on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is run and managed by people in their 30s, and the people who run the high-tech companies on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> are mainly in their 50s and 60s,'' he said. `` People in their 20s and 30s have no fear _ of anything.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Josselyn </PERSON>, a computer market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, agrees that decision-making is slower and product cycles longer along Route 128. `` It's just harder to get people to move on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' he said. Examples abound: _ Wang, which pioneered the market for word processors, lost ground when it failed to move quickly into personal computers It is now making a big push into document imaging products, but it announced a $ 375 million quarterly loss Monday. Some analysts say the family-controlled company may have to find a substantial outside investor. _ <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest computer maker, also stuck with proprietary operating systems and failed to capitalize on the PC explosion Now it is moving into `` open,'' or non-proprietary, software. But <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings have slipped this year, and it has frozen salaries. _ Data General also is moving away from proprietary systems toward open software and reduced instruction set computing _ or `` risc'' _ technology, which simplifies the circuitry of a computer and allows cost savings In a two-year restructuring, it has cut its work force from 16,000 to 14,000, and posted a $ 23.1 million loss for the quarter ended June 24. Data General spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klatman </PERSON> calls the critic's charges `` baloney. `` From the time management made the decision to commit to open systems, it took us just nine months to get our first products out the door,'' he said. `` That's something you never would have seen in this industry 10 years ago.'' <PERSON> Klatman </PERSON> and others point out that aside from sales of PCs and workstations, the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer market is slow. Minicomputer makers have been hit particularly hard, squeezed between mini-supercomputers on the high end and technical workstations on the low end, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It just so happens, it's an accident of nature, that there are more minicomputer makers based in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and the traditional minicomputer is not growing at the rate of other areas,'' said <PERSON> Klatman </PERSON>.

 The jury that convicted five former officials of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> trader of racketeering charges now must decide how much money they will have to forfeit to the government. The jurors began deliberations on the forfeiture issue Tuesday after hearing arguments from both sides. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the defendants should relinquish salaries and other claims that could total more than $ 21 million. Defense attorneys, who have said they will appeal the conviction, argued that the forfeiture sought by the government was excessive and violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. On Monday, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court jury convicted the defendants of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy and numerous counts of mail and wire fraud. The case marked the first time securities professionals were accused of racketeering under a controversial federal law aimed at combating mobsters and drug pushers. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law provides for heavy fines and lengthy prison terms, in addition to forfeiture. The trial received widespread attention because it grew indirectly out of the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal that rocked Wall Street three years ago. The largest forfeiture was sought from former Princeton-Newport partner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. His partnership interest was placed at $ 13.3 million and his salary at $ 1.75 million. From former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, the government sought $ 2.5 million in salary. The prosecution asked the jury to require forfeiture for the other Princeton-Newport defendants as follows: former partner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON>, $ 1.1 million partnership interest and $ 267,483 in salary; former partner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, $ 791,191 partnership interest and $ 454,507 in salary; former partner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, $ 762,613 partnership interest and $ 558,328 in salary; and former controller <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smotrich </PERSON>, $ 124,583 in salary. `` Here's a man who has no money and the government wants him to forfeit millions and millions of dollars,'' said <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` I submit to you that is cruel and unusual punishment.'' But <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> told the jury that the racketeering statute permitted the forfeiture of all interest from an illegal enterprise. `` As they chased the almighty dollar, they crossed far past the line of law,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` You must decide whether the defendants should be stripped of some of their tainted wealth.'' The case involved a series of pre-arranged stock transactions from 1984 to 1986. The government alleged during the five-week trial that the defendants illegally bought and sold stocks to generate phony tax losses. <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON> went out of business after the indictment was brought last August. Defense lawyers said at the time that the charges alone, though unproven, destroyed the securities firm's ability to do business Besides forfeiture, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison on each of the two racketeering counts, jail terms ranging from five to three years for the other charges and fines. A sentencing date has not been scheduled. Before the lawyers presented their arguments to the jury, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> ruled that the prosecution could not tell the jury about a $ 650 million fine <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> paid to settle securities law charges in another case, which also stemmed from the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal. Defense attorneys had argued that telling jurors about the fine would prejudice them on the forfeiture question.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> families are losing at least $ 607 million a year because the government has n't passed legislation guaranteeing workers unpaid leave to care for young children or sick parents, a group backing such a law said today. `` Year after year, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families are the big losers because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has failed to pass minimum family and medical leave policies,'' <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenhoff </PERSON> of the Women's Legal Defense Fund said in prepared remarks. `` Working parents should not have to choose between having a job and having a family.'' Legislation is awaiting debate on both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floors that would require employers to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave over a two-year period to meet family needs during the birth or adoption of a child and for family medical emergencies. `` Unnecessary Losses,'' the report for the Family and Medical Leave Act Coalition, was based on a 1988 survey of 7,000 families conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The institute compiles data on a broad range of topics annually and it is then used by researchers who break out and interpret areas of particular interest to them. The analysis said the $ 607 million in family losses `` represents the additional earnings lost by new mothers who return to work, but are unable to return to their former jobs because their employers do n't have parental leave policies in place.'' `` When these new mothers without job-protected leaves return to work but are unable to return to their former jobs, they experience more unemployment and lower wages than those mothers who return after a period of protected leave,'' the report said. Moreover, the report said, taxpayers spend $ 108 million a year on government assistance programs that would n't be necessary if there was a nationwide family and medical leave program. `` Working mothers without job-protected leave receive $ 108 million more in assistance from such programs as unemployment insurance, supplemental security income and welfare than do mothers working for employers with parental leave policies,'' the report said. `` As <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prepares to leave for their summer break, we wanted to remind our nation's lawmakers that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families are suffering unnecessary losses due to their inaction on family policies,'' <PERSON> Lenhoff </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has boosted its daily flights to 350 as part of a plan to emerge from a crippling strike as a leaner carrier, but unionized pilots say the only thing that has increased is the danger level. The expansion, which began on Tuesday, represents an increase of nearly 60 percent over last month's schedule. Eastern is now back to about a third of its pre-strike size. `` It's another major step back from the impact of the strike and the bankruptcy and a very significant phase in the rebuilding of the airline,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. But union officials called the schedule expansion an unsafe rush to return with inexperienced flight crews. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying, `` If you get past all of the hype and all of the slogans, there is a level of risk to the flying public never before experienced in the history of American commercial aviation.'' <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> said 75 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flight crews are unfamiliar with the type of aircraft they are flying and that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is violating federal standards by pairing inexperienced pilots. `` We are in complete and total compliance with all <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rules,'' Eastern's <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> countered. `` Our training and procedures are guided by conservatism is all respects.'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> added the unions have repeatedly used `` safety scares and smear tactics'' in an effort to hurt Eastern. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said Eastern `` is meeting the recommendation. If there is anything to the contrary, we would like to know about it.'' Eastern said the inreased flights went off smoothly, except for one <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-to-Montreal </ORGANIZATION> flight canceled because a catering truck damaged a plane. Also, some passengers in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub, where many of the new flights were added, complained about long delays. `` This is my first time on Eastern in two years _ first and last,'' said passenger <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who complained that his flight from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> arrived about an hour late. `` My travel agent talked me into this for the $ 39 fare.'' To entice more passengers Eastern offered temporary one-way fares as low as $ 39. It also was required to lease several planes from its sister carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Unable to maintain its pre-strike schedule of nearly 1,100 daily flights when the strike began March 4, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection five days later. Last month, the company filed a reorganization plan calling for Eastern to emerge from bankruptcy by year's end at two-thirds its previous size. The airline's unions back an alternative buyout proposal by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>. Eastern said it plans to increase its daily flights to 390 by Aug. 15. Its goal is 800 daily flights from 77 cities, down from 102 cities before the strike. Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The unions contend <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> wants either to liquidate Eastern or merge it with predominantly non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>.

PLC and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement with the British government on conditions for resuming their joint bid for <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, the government said The British and German electronics giants have pledged to remedy public interest questions identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief statement. The department in April said <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> could renew their bid for <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>, also a British electronics company, on the recommendation of the monopolies commission. But the clearance was conditioned upon the companies negotiating with the department and the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> to ensure there is no reduction in competition in the British defense electronics industry. Details of the agreement were n't immediately available. But a department spokesman said there were `` no differences of substance'' between the measures agreed to by <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> and the recommendations made in the commission's April report. Among the commission's chief objections to the original structure of the <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> takeover was an accompanying plan for <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> to acquire a 35 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>' defense interests. The commission said it opposed such a stake on the ground it would give <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> an interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> radar and military communications interests to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>. The original GEC-Siemens offer made earlier this year, valuing <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> at $ 2.8 billion, automatically lapsed when the monopolies commission launched its inquiry in January. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> refused to say whether the two companies would renew their bid. `` We are considering with our partners'' on the next step, said the spokesman, who was n't identified, in accordance with British custom. Under British takeover regulations, <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> have 21 days in which to re-introduce their bid. A <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> spokesman could n't be reached for comment. <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> is not related to the similarly named American company.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, putting aside for the moment the legal battle between <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, dined peacefully together this week and announced an `` office on a disc'' for the Apple Macintosh. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, quipped that `` the legal departments are n't friends.'' But he noted that the two companies remain steadfast allies and share the same vision of the future of computing. <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said his appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> presentation on Tuesday `` shows that we want to be partners together in innovation'' despite <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s ongoing copyright suit against <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Apple and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> are working together `` more now than at any time in the past,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said `` We have decided not to let -LRB- the lawsuit -RRB- affect the other things we're doing and let it run its own course.'' <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, recently won a round in the courtroom fight when a federal judge issued a tentative ruling that would substantially narrow <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s suit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> of stealing the `` look and feel'' of the Macintosh system. `` <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> has always been very clear that we do n't understand why Apple brought the lawsuit, and that we expect to win the lawsuit,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` I think the recent developments are consistent with -LRB- our -RRB- predictions. The case is not over but it was a very positive milestone.'' The `` office on a disc'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macintosh </ORGANIZATION> consists of a compact disc containing four of <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s most popular business programs for the Macintosh _ <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Word </ORGANIZATION>, Excel, PowerPoint and Mail _ plus documentation for each, a thesaurus and other items. Both companies hope the product will help spur the evolution from floppy diskettes to compact disks for computers. The <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> collection on disk will be priced at $ 949 and is expected to be available by the end of September. That is a one-third discount from what the programs would cost if bought separately on floppy diskettes. Sales of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s compact disc drive, which retails for about $ 1,200, have been slow so far as businesses await more software for it. `` This is just an introductory technology. I do n't expect it to have a major financial impact,'' said analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It's more a demonstration of capabilities, laying the groundwork for future uses.''

<HEAD>Eisner: New Disney Studio Theme Park to Expand to Handle Large Crowds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Heavy crowds and unexpectedly long waiting lines will soon force <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> to double the size of the entertainment portion of its new Disney-MGM Studios theme park, company Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> says. `` The demand for it has been even greater than our wildest hopes,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. `` We do not want the lines to be that long. We are trying to rectify it as soon as we can.'' Specific plans for the expansion, to be carried out in three years, will be announced in six weeks, <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Tuesday. The $ 500 million, 135-acre central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> complex has two sections: the themed area, which is the site of most of the major attractions, and the film production portion, where visitors ride trams and walk through a backstage tour. <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said the studio park `` needs to be bigger, and it needs to be on the scale of the other two parks,'' known as the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center. The Magic Kingdom's estimated capacity is 45,000 and <PERSON> Epcot </PERSON>'s about 60,000 The studio theme park can handle about half the crowds of the Magic Kingdom. Because many of its attractions now are geared toward adults, the studio expansion would add more attractions for younger children and introduce more traditional Disney characters, <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. It also would introduce a nighttime extravaganza _ like the fireworks show at the Magic Kingdom and a laser light show at <LOCATION> Epcot </LOCATION> _ plus a themed `` land'' attraction such as Fantasyland and <ORGANIZATION> Tomorrowland </ORGANIZATION> now at the Magic Kingdom. <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> would not say how much the new construction would cost. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION>, plans to open the theme park portion of its new <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> to tourists in the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> area this coming spring. Its working studio, which began movie and television production last fall, is billed as the nation's largest outside <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. The studio-and-tour complex is built on a 440-acre site, more than three times as big as <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, has taken issue with <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>'s remarks that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s park is `` a new concept, a new idea.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> officials contend that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> copied the idea. `` We strongly believe that not only the ` idea' to do a studio tour, but much of the specific content of the Disney attraction originated with <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, which has been operating a studio tour in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> since 1964,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said in an interview after <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s studio park opened last May.

<HEAD>Sales of New Homes Rose 5.5 Percent in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of new homes, propelled by falling mortgage rates, rose 5.5 percent in June, the third consecutive monthly increase, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales of new single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000 units in June as the housing industry continued to rebound from a sluggish period earlier in the year when sales fell to their lowest level since the 1981-82 recession. Mortgage rates fell further in July, causing many economists to look for a climb in home sales and construction in the months ahead. In fact, many economists believe that a significant rebound in housing is needed to keep the country out of a recession. In a second report showing a slight rebound, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for manufactured goods edged up 0.4 percent in June following a steep 2.6 percent drop in May. Fixed mortgage rates dipped last week to 9.81 percent, their lowest point since April 1987. Fixed-rate mortgages peaked in March at 11.22 percent, the same month that housing starts fell to an annual rate of 555,000 units, their most sluggish pace since December 1982. The 5.5 percent rise in new home sales in June followed a 4.3 percent May advance and a 9.7 percent rise in April. Altogether, the three months of increases have driven home sales 20.7 percent above their March low. The increase in sales has come despite the fact that home prices are up sharply. The median price of a new home jumped 8.3 percent in June to $ 129,900. This designates the level where half the homes in the country sold for more and half sold for less. The average price of a new home rose as well, climbing 8.4 percent to $ 159,100. Housing analysts have blamed the increase on the fact that much of the market is now composed of the move-up buyer, who can afford a more expensive home. First-time buyers have been frozen out so far by the jump in mortgage rates. The June increase in sales was powered by a 23.4 percent jump in sales in the West, which climbed to an annual rate of 232,000 units. Sales in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> were up as well but by a smaller 3.1 percent to an annual rate of 99,000 units. Sales in the South edged up 1.9 percent to a rate of 267,000 units. The increases were enough to offset a giant 18.2 percent drop in new home sales in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, whcih fell to an annual rate of 72,000 units.

 Badly divided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats took their fight over a capital-gains tax cut behind closed doors today and apparently agreed only that opposition should not be a litmus test of party loyalty. Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the caucus indicated to him that most Democrats oppose a major cut in capital-gains tax rates, as is favored by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I believe that is bad tax policy, bad fiscal policy, unwise, inequitable and ill-timed,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. But he added there has been no talk of retaliating against Democrats who side with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the issue. `` We do n't have a guillotine around here,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., a Ways and Means member who is chief sponsor of the proposed rate cut, said he has enough votes in committee and in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to pass the plan cutting the tax on profits realized from investments in securities or property Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the committee, said, `` I think there's a hopeful atmosphere of some kind of compromise,'' perhaps along lines of a new plan that he outlined Tuesday His proposal would protect investors from having to pay taxes on gains caused by inflation, but he declined to provide other details. He has said he could not support a reduction in the capital-gains tax rate. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said he planned to present the idea later today to the 13 Republican members of his committee who have joined six Democrats to produce a majority in favor of a rate cut. A Republican committee member, who spoke on condition that he not be identified by name, said there was no chance <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> can persuade Republicans to drop their support of a rate cut, an idea already rejected by the White House. However, the first task facing <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> is to win back at least one of the six Democrats. If he does that, he'll have an 18-18 tie in the committee, and wo n't have to face the caucus in the somewhat embarrassing position of being in a minority on his own committee. One of the six Democrats, Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> called the proposal `` creative'' and said it probably could have drawn wide support if it had been presented earlier. `` It's a pretty sound concept, but six of us are still committed to Mr. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' proposal,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> referred to another of the six, Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., chief sponsor of a plan to cut the top capital gains tax rate to 19.6 percent for two years, and then raise it to 28 percent and exclude gains caused by inflation The top rate is identical with the top federal income tax rate on other income, 28 percent, or, for certain upper-income taxpayers, 33 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not formally endorsed <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' plan, but administration officials have said there was a lot in it they could support. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal would set a top rate of 15 percent, but it would not apply to timber or commercial buildings. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s plan would exempt gains caused by inflation from taxation, but neither he nor <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> would give further details. The change would apply to profits from assets sold after Dec. 31, 1989. Capital gains are increased values of any asset _ stocks, homes, farms, stamp collections or almost anything that has value. All parties agree that a lower capital gains tax rate increases government revenue in the first year or so it is in effect as investors take advantage of the rate reduction to get rid of investments they no longer find of top appeal. The Democratic leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, has opposed a rate reduction on the grounds that most of the benefits would go to taxpayers making more than $ 100,000 a year. Supporters have argued that denial of rate cuts on those grounds is nonsensical because it hurts the economy and stifles job-creating new investments. The other four Democrats targeted by <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> are <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today said investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who holds a stake in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> stock, has proposed a possible acquisition of the cosmetics company for $ 41 a share, or nearly $ 3 billion. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said it received a letter from <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> late Tuesday requesting a meeting to negotiate the deal. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' letter would be discussed at the board's regular meeting on Thursday. In a brief statement, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said he has sent a letter to <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> informing him that the Avon board repeatedly has said the company is not for sale. Earlier this year, the Avon board rejected a $ 39-a-share takeover offer from rival direct selling company <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and indicated at the time that it would resist future acquisition attempts. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its bid of about $ 2.1 billion but continues to hold roughly 10.3 percent of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>'s common stock outstanding in a partnership with <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. The A-J Partnership, as the alliance of <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> is called, did not act jointly in making the initial bid for <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> nor are they acting together now. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said in a telephone interview today that <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> was not participating in his offer for Avon in any way. If <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> prevails in his takeover attempt, he said, he plans to sell <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s retail division, which consists of some the country's best-selling perfumes sold at department store counters, including <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and Red The direct selling operations of New York-based Avon in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad would be retained, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. He said he has no intention of selling any piece of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> or to <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of direct seller <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also has previously expressed interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who runs his investment operations from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, also said he has submitted a filing to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in which he said he has hired an investment banking division of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> to arrange financing for the all-cash bid. He said he has not had any contact with <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> executives except a telephone call to acknowledge receipt of his letter. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' $ 41-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> is worth about $ 2.25 billion based on 54.91 million shares of common stock outstanding. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> also said in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that he contemplates redeeming <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s preferred shares, which would cost $ 33.50 per share, or a total of about $ 603 million <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> also has about $ 1 billion in debt that would be part of any acquisition.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, halfway through another record year, today opened contract talks with union leaders who say they want a wage hike this time instead of the productivity bonuses of the past six years. Negotiations began in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, between <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and three districts of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which represent 57,800 workers in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. Representing the union are District 751 president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>'s District 70 and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s District 24. Aerospace industry analysts say the union is in a strong position to exact a favorable settlement because of a $ 67 billion backlog of commercial airplane orders, $ 346 million in profits in the first half of 1989 and a shortage of skilled workers that forced <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> to borrow <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers earlier this year. Union officials say they want an hourly wage increase, likely to be in the double-digits, to replace once-a-year productivity bonuses <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has given the past six years. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> customers have been irritated by deliver delays for 747-400 model jets. With 44 due for delivery in the last quarter, a work stoppage would jeopardize <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation for reliability. The company borrowed about 600 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> workers earlier this year as it rescheduled delivery dates for the 747-400, and union officials say those workers should be leaving <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> this month. `` I think they will get a wage increase ... I do n't think push is going to come to shove here,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, aerospace analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The chance of a strike is small, say analysts, who believe <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers know they are better off riding the crest of record airplane orders than sitting out the good times on a picket line. `` I would not anticipate a prolonged labor disruption or strike,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Deatherage </PERSON>, aerospace analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Not many people at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> are not aware of the cyclical nature of the business. This is the opportunity of a lifetime -LRB- for workers -RRB- to get all the overtime they can,'' he said. Other union contract requests will cover overtime rules, an improved cost-of-living index, better pension payments, on-site education programs and child care, union officers said. Wages will be the last item discussed. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, led by chief negotiator <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON>, vice president of human resources, has until Aug. 9 to make its first counterproposal, with further negotiations scheduled as needed. The union's current three-year contract expires Oct. 3. Before departing for <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the union would ask for a `` significant'' wage increase, adding he did not consider a single-digit increase significant. Except for welders, the people who make <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes currently earn $ 8.88 to $ 18.42 per hour depending on pay level and seniority. The average wage is $ 13.50 to $ 14 an hour. `` All the signals are that it looks good for us. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> can well afford to pay an increase in wages and increase benefits,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Our relations have in general been very good with the union,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. He declined to comment on the negotiations. Union officials want a wage increase to replace, either completely or partially, the bonuses that have ranged from 3 percent to 12 percent a year since 1983. Analysts said a reasonable increase would not affect <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s profitability, especially if it can pass part of the increase on to customers <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also adjusts its prices as labor and commodity indexes rise. `` Customers may have to take a bite in the next three years'' if a wage hike is granted, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, senior aerospace analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> He is not related to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, has said that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s goal is to hold down costs to improve profit margins and increase shareholders' return on equity. The union's bargaining position represents a complete turnaround from its position during the 1983 and 1986 negotiations. In 1983, about 12,000 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers had been laid off because of the industry slump, weakening the union's hand at the bargaining table.

<HEAD>GTW Wins $100 Million Libel Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury awarded $ 100 million in libel damages today to <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> after rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that the communications company was to blame for lost sales <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> contended <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> did n't give it adequate equipment to handle a large volume of calls in 1986 and 1987 as the network expanded into 11 new markets. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> won the case on its counterclaim. The six-member jury reached its verdict after about five hours of deliberations in the complicated case following a six-week trial before Pinellas Circuit Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rives </PERSON>. The award was to be split evenly by <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communciations </ORGANIZATION>. In a breakdown of each award, the jury said $ 10 million should by paid by <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>, $ 20 million by board Chairman <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON> and $ 20 million by President <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Paxon </PERSON>. In final arguments Monday, <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> told `` little white lies'' to the network to cover up the communications company's failure to provide for the volume of calls. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> responded that a Dec. 2, 1986, letter placed in evidence documented that <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> thought the telephone firm had been `` responsive to all our previous needs'' and was looking forward `` to continuing this highly successful relationship.'' Ten months after that, <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> sued, claiming it lost millions of calls and about $ 500 million in potential sales because its <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> telephone network equipment was insufficient for the volume of calls. The parent company, based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> subsidiary and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> were named as defendants. In response, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> filed a slander and libel counterclaim placing blame for <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s decline in the electronics market and stock market on its own mismanagement there. <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 purchase of 11 UHF stations in new markets, combined with its entrance into the cable television market, caused subscribers to soar from 9 million to 46.5 million in one year, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> knew about the cable arrangements, he added. Cable companies were offered a $ 1 million stock option which enhanced their interest in <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>, he said, and 70 cable outlets were obtained. But, even when <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> made its initial public offering of stock on May 13, 1986, the company did n't mention its plans to purchase the broadcast stations as a second operational network, <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> argued. He recalled that <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> operations vice president <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLany </PERSON> warned in September 1986 the company did n't have enough personnel to handle the growing number of calls, but <PERSON> Speer </PERSON> `` did n't want to hear they needed more operators.'' Competition from similar retailers also has hurt <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said.

 Shares ended sharply higher Wednesday following a strong rally on Wall Street during the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> afternoon. A lack of selling pressure and strong rallies in the retaili and pharmaceutical sectors also combined to push the market higher. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share ended up 15.5 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,307.8, the session high. At its lowest, the index touched 2,285.8, a fall of 6.5 points.

Dealers said trading volume wilted during the afternoon, as the market tracked movements on Wall Street. `` It was a pretty volatile day but it seemed the market wanted to rally after its declines earlier in the week,'' one trader said. Volume was 424.8 million shares, compared with 413.5 million shares Tuesday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Wednesday to re-enter the financial markets for the first time since defaulting on $ 2.25 billion in bonds for two nuclear plants in 1983. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to sell $ 450 million in revenue bonds to refund higher interest bonds sold in 1981 and 1982. Pricing and sale of the bonds for <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plants 1 and 3 are expected to take place the week of Aug. 21. The 1983 default on bonds for nuclear plants 4 and 5 was the largest in municipal bond market history. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bond ratings were suspended in 1983, but <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> restablished its rating late last year. The refunding bonds are secured by net billing agreements that require the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a self-financed federal agency that markets electric power, to pay all costs connected with projects 1 and 3. The net billed bonds are the first step in a long-awaited refunding program to reduce debt service on about $ 2 billion of high interest bonds. The supply system also expects to refund aproximately $ 800 million of high-interest bonds issued for project 2 over the next several years. `` At current interest rates, the program will reduce the supply system's costs an average of $ 70 - $ 80 million a year over the next 30 years,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>, supply system managing director, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jura </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said in a statement Following the WPPSS default, an amendment to federal bankruptcy laws clarified that a bankruptcy would not impair protection of revenues, funds and other assets of projects 1, 2 and 3 from claims by projects 4 and 5 bondholders. In contrast to projects 4 and 5, bonds for projects 1 through 3 are secured by net billing agreements with <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>, which markets power from 30 federal hydroelectric projects, most in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basin. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> is a consortium of utilities that was formed in the early 1970s to build the five nuclear plants. Bonneville and participating utilities without interruption have provided funds for all obligations with respect to supply system bonds on projects 1 through 3 since the first bonds were issued in 1971. Project 2 has been in commercial operation since 1984. Projects 1 and 3 are in extended construction delay because the energy they would produce is n't needed presently.

 Wheat futures prices were mostly higher but corn and soybeans lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, where the expected commodity fraud indictments may have sent some traders to the sidelines early. While wheat thrived in the wake of a 100,000-ton buy late Tuesday by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and rumors of a second buy, equally large purchases of soybeans established a contract low for the seventh time in eight days.

 Stock prices rallied today, rebounding from Tuesday's setback. The market's unsettled showing Tuesday was attributed partly to concern that the slowing of the economy might lead to something worse than the `` soft landing'' many economists have been predicting.

The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that new factory orders rose 0.4 percent in June.

 An advertising agency said Wednesday it had dropped the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>' $ 5 million-a-year account, saying proprietor <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> intruded too much and recently cut agency fees by 60 percent. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who has been on trial in a tax evasion case in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, has been depicted in the advertising as the `` queen'' standing on guard making sure everything is perfect at the hotels. The ad agency <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Aarons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had handled the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> account for the past three years Agency president <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON> said her company stands to lose $ 500,000 a year from its decision. `` All of us knew she was queen and we were there to serve her,'' <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON> said. `` It was evident in her body language, her imperiousness and her arrogance.'' She described a typical business meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>: `` She was drinking martinis, and I was drinking <PERSON> Brioschi </PERSON>. There was a lot of tension ... She told me, ` Do n't get comfortable. You're not here for a social event.' Agency officials said she sealed her fate with <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON> when she imposed an arbitrary 60 percent cut in agency fees for May and June. They said Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was informed of the decision in a letter sent to her home. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was approached by reporters at the courthouse about the agency's decision, but she said nothing. <PERSON> Taylor-Gordon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON> was not the first agency to use Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> in ads for the hotel chain, or to dub her the `` queen.'' The approach was apparently effective: occupancy jumped from 24 percent before the ads to 87 percent afterwards, agency officials said.

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 217.63 million shares.

<HEAD>Say Air Bags Increase Ford Prices for 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 models will cost about 4.8 percent more than 1989 models, partly because of new federal requirements on air-bag protection for passengers, a preliminary price list indicates. The increase showed up in a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> advisory recently sent to dealers for use in taking early orders for fall, company spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` About half of that is for air bags,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> said of the price boost. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will announce final prices for the 1990 models in mid-September, two to three weeks in advance of the Oct. 5 debut of new vehicles, he said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials remained silent Wednesday on their pricing plans for the new model year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will announce prices later this month in preparation for a late September introduction of the new models, spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will announce prices in late September or early October and introduce its 1990 models in early October, spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. Neither <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has sent preliminary prices to dealers, the two said. Analysts have predicted automakers would trim production in anticipation of slow 1989 sales continuing into next year, consequently raising prices. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> have estimated air bags will add $ 500 to the price of a new car, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that cost at between $ 350 and $ 700.

 The dollar gained against most major foreign currencies in subdued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings Wednesday after weakening on markets abroad. Gold prices posted minor changes. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for August delivery closed at $ 370.10 a troy ounce, down 70 cents from Tuesday's settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 369.70 an ounce as of 4 p.m. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 80 cents lower than Tuesday's late bid. Despite closing near its highest levels of the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, currency dealers said the dollar lacked direction and a bearish undercurrent lingered in the market due to the likelihood of additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rate declines. The value of a country's currency typically is eroded by reductions in the country's interest rates. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, of Bear, <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed part of the buying to reactions to Tuesday's selloff and maneuvers in anticipation of reports expected to shed more light on the condition of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s June report on the Index of Leading Economic Indicators is scheduled for Thursday release and on Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is due to issue June unemployment figures. The market was preoccupied with developments in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> regarding Western hostages. Reports of American warships moving positions raised speculation about possible military action in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> following the reported execution of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Earlier, in currency trading in foreign financial centers, the dollar ended generally lower. Dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> reported trading seemed trendless, with the number of participants operating in the market down due to summer holidays. They said the dollar was unlikely to make any major moves ahead of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic reports. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.45 yen to close at 136.20 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 136.05 yen. But, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 136.60 yen, up from 135.80 yen on Tuesday. The British pound traded at $ 1.6635 late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up from Tuesday's $ 1.6550. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling stood at $ 1.6560 compared to $ 1.6648 on Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8575 West German marks, up from 1.8505; 1.5970 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 1.17515 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1747; 6.29 French francs, up from 6.266; and 1,334.50 Italian lire, up from 1,330.05.

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ Investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> has made a roughly $ 2.85 billion takeover proposal to <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the latest unsolicited offer for the cosmetics company that has spurned previous suitors, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> disclosed Wednesday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' request for a meeting to negotiate a possible purchase of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> _ the world's biggest direct sales company _ would be reviewed at the board's regular meeting on Thursday at <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. In a brief news release, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said he sent a letter to <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> informing him that in the past the board members have stressed that <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> is not for sale. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who oversees his investment empire from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that he's never been in a better position to carry out an acquisition attempt and indicated he would be tenacious in his quest for Avon. `` We've had the best year we've ever had,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. `` All these things play a part. I have never been more serious about a commitment in my life.'' In three separate deals in the past year, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and investment partners reported making more than $ 164 million in profit. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' $ 41-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> is worth about $ 2.25 billion based on 54.91 million shares of common stock outstanding. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> also said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that he contemplates redeeming <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s preferred shares, which would cost $ 33.50 per share, or a total of about $ 603 million, raising the price tag on <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> to roughly $ 2.85 billion. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> also has about $ 1 billion in debt that would be part of any acquisition. Avon stock gained $ 1 to $ 36.50 a share in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Wednesday. The company has slammed the door on at least two suitors in recent months. In May, the Avon board rejected a hostile $ 39-a-share takeover bid from rival direct selling company <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and indicated at the time that it would resist future acquisition attempts. Only days after <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> turned down <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the door-to-door makeup seller <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, disclosed its interest in acquiring <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> and also got a cold shoulder. Although <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its bid of about $ 2.1 billion, the company still has a stake in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. Through a partnership with <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> has an interest in about 10.3 percent of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>'s common stock outstanding. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> controls about 55 percent of the <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> stock owned by <ORGANIZATION> A-J </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, as the alliance of <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> is called. The partnership did n't act jointly in making the initial bid for <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said they are not acting together now. If he prevails in his takeover attempt, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said, he would keep <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s core direct-selling business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and retain a significant interest in the company's international division. There are about 475,000 Avon sales representatives operating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and another 1 million selling Avon cosmetics, toiletries and jewelry in foreign markets. Avon, known in the past for the ad slogan `` <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong </PERSON>, Avon Calling,'' is the world's biggest direct-sales company <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said if he gets control of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> he would sell <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION>'s retail division, which consists of some of the country's best-selling perfumes sold at department store counters, including <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and He also would finish divesting the health care businesses which <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has been selling. The divestitures have been part of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>'s strategy to enhance profitability. In the second quarter, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> earned $ 39.5 million on sales of $ 778 million compared with a loss of $ 82.5 million and sales of $ 704 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said he had no intention of selling any piece of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> or to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. He said he has not had any contact with <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> executives except a telephone call to acknowledge receipt of his letter. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> would n't take a management position at <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> if he gains control, he said. But he said he is familiar with the industry by virtue of his ownership of <ORGANIZATION> Watkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Winona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> purchased the health and beauty aids company out of bankruptcy in 1977 <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said he has hired an investment banking arm of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> to help him arrange financing for the all-cash offer for Avon.

 Energy futures prices closed mixed Wednesday with crude oil bouncing back from earlier lows despite ongoing concern about excess oil supplies. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the September contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 25 cents to finish at $ 18.28 a barrel after falling 28 cents on Tuesday. The contract had dipped to $ 17.78 a barrel during the trading session. Contracts for later delivery were mixed. Among refined oil products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline for September delivery fell 0.58 cent to 50.85 cents a gallon, while future contracts were mixed. Domestic heating oil for September rose 0.34 cent to 49.54 cents a gallon and other contract months were mostly higher. The market opened lower mainly on a report showing that oil and gasoline inventories are continuing to rise. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said supplies of crude oil, gasoline and heating oil increased in the week ended July 28. The API report was released after the close of trading on Tuesday. Crude oil inventories rose 882,000 barrels to 331.4 million barrels from the previous week, while gasoline stocks increased by 4.6 million barrels to 225.96 million and heating oil rose by 2.1 million to 111.5 million barrels, the report said. On a yearly basis, however, crude oil stocks were down 16.9 million barrels from the same time last year and heating oil was off 6.8 million barrels. Gasoline inventories, however, were 16.3 million barrels higher. Later in the day, traders said oil prices recovered, partly on technical factors. `` The momentum just was n't there to move lower,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglio </PERSON>, energy broker for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said nervousness about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> also helped boost prices. Traders have attributed some price strength in recent days to investor concern that political events involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages could disrupt oil shipments from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Soar on News of Big Export Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cocoa futures snapped a slump and surged Wednesday on rumors that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the world's largest producer, had sold 500,000 tons to a major trading house. On other markets, sugar continued rallying in the face of growing demand and the fear of weak yields from Western Eurpoean crops; soybeans fell to a new low for the seventh time in eight days, depressed by wet weather and stuck there because many traders halted trading early to await indictments stemming for a 2 -LCB- - year investigation into commodities trading fraud Cocoa, traded on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Coffee, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, jumped at the opening bell after rumors surfaced that <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphet-Boigny </PERSON>, who had been in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in recent days, helped seal a huge export deal with trading company <ORGANIZATION> Philipp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The rumored deal suggested a heightened demand for cocoa, which has languished recently. The size of such a purchase, if confirmed, would also raise the possibility of short-term supply problems. `` As sleepy as the market had been, a lot of traders thought the market was at its technical bottom and as soon as it got a boost from the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> report, there were a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Henig </PERSON>, who tracks commodities for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Cocoa climbed $ 66 to $ 70 per ton higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 1,327 a ton. Sugar continued gaining because demand is outpacing supply. Early reports that a virus has cut substantially into crop yields in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> helped bolster prices. Sugar climbed .22 cent to .31 cent higher, with October at 14.43 cents a pound. Nervousness over commodity fraud indictments, announced after the close of business Wednesday, had sent some traders to the sidelines early at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures prices closed higher, but corn and soybeans were mostly lower. Wheat thrived in the wake of a 100,000-ton buy late Tuesday by the Chinese, and there were rumors they planned a second, equally large purchase. But November soybeans slipped 7 cents, establishing a contract low for the seventh time in eight days. The indictments `` probably kept people away,'' said one trader who asked not to be identified. `` But how much effect it actually had is debatable. A lot of this is already in the market. `` And besides,'' the trader added, `` bearish weather is killing the beans _ not indictments.'' Wheat was unchanged to 2 -RCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.90 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher, with September at $ 2.21 -LCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to -LCB- cent higher, with September at $ 1.33 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower, with August at $ 6.08 \ Livestock and pork futures were sharply higher at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle climbed .35 cent to 1.20 cents, with August at 73.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .60 cent higher, with August at 83.62 cents pound; live hogs were .23 cent to 1.23 cents higher, with August at 46.35 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to 1.10 cents higher, with August at 25.92 cents a pound. Precious metals were off slightly, with silver leading the decline. At the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold settled 79 cents to $ 1.50 lower, with August at $ 370.10 a troy ounce; silver was 2.7 cents to 3 cents lower, with August at 522.5 cents a troy ounce. Platinum, traded at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, was off $ 1.50 to $ 1.60, with September at $ 500.10 a troy ounce.

Crude oil was 9 cents lower to 25 cents higher, with September at $ 18.28 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent lower to .34 cent higher, with September at 49.54 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .58 cent lower to .35 cent higher, with Septmeber at 50.85 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Major Airlines Match Fare Cuts by Continental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The rare phenomenon of a summer air fare war broke out Wednesday, as several major airlines matched a discount program announced a day earlier by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, often a fare-cutting leader, said Tuesday it reduced to $ 75 each way its weekend fares through Labor Day on most non-stops, and lowered transcontinental fares to $ 100 each way. Tickets for the lowered fares must be purchased on a round-trip basis and are non-refundable. The cuts were quickly matched Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, two of the largest carriers, joined in Wednesday, along with <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` For competitive reasons, we will match this,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Blattner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Fares normally hold steady or rise in summer, when travel demand is at its peak. `` Recent research shows that more and more Americans want to take several more short vacations, or long weekend trips,'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` So what we've done is develop this nationwide weekend fare program to meet this growing trend.'' Tickets must be purchased by Aug. 11 and must be paid for within 24 hours after a reservation is made. Travel must begin on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday. On some of the airlines, the return flight must be on that same weekend or the Monday following it. On others, the return may be on any Saturday, Sunday or Monday through Labor Day. About 750,000 seats will be available on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for the lowered fares on each of the five weekends, according to the airline. Under the new fares, a round trip from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> will cost $ 150 on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, compared with the carrier's current lowest, advance-purchase MaxSaver fare of $ 318. A round trip from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> will cost $ 150, compared with the lowest MaxSaver fare of $ 298. A New York-Seattle roundtrip on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> will cost $ 200, compared with the $ 358 MaxSaver fare, and a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-to-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> round trip also will cost $ 200, compared with the $ 358 MaxSaver price.

 Sales of new homes climbed 5.5 percent in June, the third consecutive monthly increase, the government said Wednesday in a report that gave some economists hope that a rebound in housing will help keep the country out of a recession this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales of new single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000 units in June as sales continued to respond favorably to falling mortgage rates after skidding in March to their slowest pace in more than six years. Mortgage rates, which peaked at 11.22 percent for fixed-rate loans in March, have been falling since that time, helped along by credit easing on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. Optimistic forecasters said they believed a rebound in housing and other credit-sensitive sectors of the economy would be enough to keep the record peacetime expansion chugging along, although at a more modest pace in the second half of the year. `` We are confident that we can avoid a recession,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Housing is recovering from a slump earlier in the year as people respond to lower interest rates.'' But a second economic report Wednesday produced less enthusiasm. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new orders for manufactured goods remained weak in June, edging up by only 0.4 percent after a steep 2.6 percent drop in May. Factory orders have fallen in three of the past six months, and the widespread view is that manufacturing will weaken further in coming months as businesses cut back their own investment plans. But many economists said they believed strong export sales and a rebound in housing would be enough to keep the economy moving forward. `` If exports continue fairly strong and housing comes back, that will help offset the weakness in other areas,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` We believe we will be able to skim by without a recession.'' Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> said her optimism was based in part on the fact that sales of both new and existing homes posted good gains in June, even before the biggest part of the drop in mortgage rates had occurred in July. Fixed rate mortgages are currently averaging 9.81 percent, their lowest level since early 1987. Economists are predicting further declines in the months ahead as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> continues easing credit in an effort to prevent a recession. `` Buyers are taking advantage of falling interest rates to buy the most they can afford,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. `` The continued decline in rates is drawing buyers to new homes as well as existing homes.'' The 5.5 percent rise in new home sales in June followed a 4.3 percent May advance and a 9.7 percent rise in April. Altogether, the three months of increases have driven home sales 20.7 percent above their low point of the year, an annual rate of 555,000 sales in March, which was the weakest sales pace since December 1982 in the depths of the last recession. Home prices were up as well in June with the median price of a new home jumping 8.3 percent to $ 129,900. The median price means half the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price of a new home was up 8.4 percent to $ 159,100. Housing analysts said part of the increase reflects the fact that much of the market is composed of move-up buyers who can afford more expensive homes. The June increase in sales was powered by a 23.4 percent jump in sales in the West, which climbed to an annual rate of 232,000 units. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> real estate market is currently the strongest in the country. Sales in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> were up as well but by a smaller 3.1 percent to an annual rate of 99,000 units. Sales in the South edged up 1.9 percent to a rate of 267,000 units. The increases were enough to offset a giant 18.2 percent drop in new home sales in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, which fell to an annual rate of 72,000 units. Analysts said that the Northeast, until last year the hottest market in country, was suffering from a sharp run-up in prices. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed price declines were inevitable in this region, especially given the high inventory of unsold homes being carried by many developers.

 As Wall Street's rally resumed Wednesday, major stock market indexes set records in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. The American stock exchanges are not the only ones that have rebounded from the world stock market crash of Oct. 19 and 20, 1987. In fact, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks trails other major indexes in its recovery. Stock prices rose Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the world's biggest stock market, but remained below the record high set in Monday's session. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market was the first to climb back above the highs reached in 1987. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> shares remained below their 1987 peaks but set a post-crash high, influenced by the rally on Wall Street and rallies in retailing and pharmaceutical stocks. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index rose to 2,307.8. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, share prices recovered from their early weakness to close slightly higher in thin trading. The CAC index of French shares reached a record high of 505.9. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, foreign buying of blue-chip stocks kept a rally going on the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Mercedes cars, was again the strongest performer. The exchange's Dax index entered record territory during the session but slipped back. In <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> stock market index set a record 6,208.77, rising in harmony with other European exchanges. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, stock prices were mixed but there were enough gainers to push the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> main market index to a record for a third consecutive session. The CBS general shares index hit 201.6. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the bull run in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> continued with an 18th record in 20 sessions. Forestry shares led the way. The Affaersvaerlden index closed at 1,317.2. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s news of a resurgence of inflation failed to hurt the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> stock market, where the main index jumped to a record 1,153. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> ended up 0.88 points at 34,899. It surpassed 35,000 for the first time at the end of morning trading but then retreated. So far this year the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market has risen 23.5 percent; the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> stock market is up 27 percent; the Japanese market is up 9.6 percent; and the West German market is up 19.3 percent, when measured in local currencies, according to statistics compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perspective </ORGANIZATION>, a Geneva-based subsidiary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment banking firm. In the very long term, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s stock prices are up nearly 1,600 percent since 1969, while American prices are up a relatively meager 320 percent.

 An attorney who admitted she mistakenly gave confidential court documents to a reporter during the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> takeover fight has been ordered to appear before the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> of the New York-based law firm <ORGANIZATION> Wachtell </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipton </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> has been ordered to court Aug. 22 to show why she should not be held in contempt. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> was on vacation Wednesday and could not be reached for comment. Law partner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> called the incident `` inadvertant and not blameworthy.'' The law firm represented <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had an agreement to be acquired by Time. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attempting a hostile takeover of Time, was appealing a <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that refused to block the merger. The documents had been submitted by Paramount in its appeal. The court had ordered the documents be kept confidential after a request from Time because they contained estimates of the dollar value of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s core businesses, including the value of People, Sports Illustrated, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and Fortune magazines. The estimates appeared July 26 in an article in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesperson for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, who did not want to be identified, called it an `` honest mistake.'' `` We know that there was no intention on her part to violate the court order and we're convinced it was an honest mistake,'' the spokesperson said. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> admitted to the court last Thursday that she supplied the documents to a Times reporter, unaware the documents were confidential. In a letter to state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said the documents were not stamped `` Confidential Under Seal'' on the cover. `` As I am sure you can imagine, as <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s counsel I certainly would have had no desire to release to the public documents as to which Time sought confidential treatment. Indeed, in -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> joined with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> in seeking confidentiality with respect to certain documents,'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> wrote. `` It is an unfortunate outcome of a document not being stamped confidential which Paramount should have stamped confidential,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said.

 A dissident Democrat said Wednesday that despite the all-out opposition of party leaders, he has enough support in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> to win a reduction in capital-gains taxes. `` I have them now,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., said when asked whether he has pledges of enough votes to win the debate <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> talked to reporters after a closed-door <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus that leaders said indicated a substantial majority of party members oppose a cut in the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks and other investments. However, some acknowledged that if a vote were taken immediately, enough Democrats would join a solid bloc of Republicans to pass the reduction. `` I think a majority of Democrats take the position that we should not agree to this particular issue,'' said Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` I believe it's bad tax policy, bad fiscal policy, unwise, inequitable and ill-timed. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was still trying to win back at least one of the six Democrats on the panel who are backing a capital-gains cut He offered a compromise that, rather than reducing thetax rate, would benefit investors by protecting inflation-caused profits against taxation. `` Republicans surprised me with how receptive they were'' to his proposal, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said after briefing members of his committee. He called his plan `` pretty much what I view as a possible compromise where everybody wins.'' His proposal, less generous than <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>', would benefit most assets except preferred stock, stock in foreign corporations, debt instruments and other intangibles. It would work this way for assets purchased after July 31, 1989: _ If held for more than one year but less than five, the asset would be `` indexed'' for inflation That is, total inflation over the years the property was owned would be subtracted from the purchase price; thus only the non-inflation gain would be taxed. _ If held for more than five years but less than 10, an investor could subtract inflation or could exclude from tax 25 percent of the sales price _ If held for more than 10 years, an investor could subtract inflation or 50 percent of the sales price `` I think there's a hopeful atmosphere of some kind of compromise,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> told reporters. He suggested the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should get more involved in the negotiations. `` It's very difficult for me to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with -LRB- Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> -LRB- a Texan who is senior Republican on <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ I do n't know who it is that can say, ` OK. We've got an understanding.' Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one of the six dissident Ways and Means Democrats, sounded a similar tone. `` Compromise must come from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> said. `` If they do n't, we'll just have a little shootout.'' The administration already has agreed informally to a compromise of sorts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed that the maximum tax on capital gains, now 33 percent, be reduced to 15 percent. He reasoned that would boost investment, create jobs and spur so much economic activity that government revenues would increase and help reduce the deficit. There was almost no support among Ways and Means Democrats for that proposal, so <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> came up with a substitute, which now has the administration's backing. The <PERSON> Jenkins-Archer </PERSON> proposal would cut the top rate to 19.6 percent for two years, then increase it to 28 percent and ensure that gains caused by inflation would not be taxed. Democratic leaders oppose a capital-gains rate cut for three reasons: because 80 percent of the benefit would go to investors with incomes totaling $ 100,000 a year or more; they say it would reduce government revenues after the first year or two, and they fear that restoring a capital-gains tax preference that was repealed as part of the 1986 tax overhaul would lead to the unraveling of that landmark law. In an effort to block the <PERSON> Jenkins-Archer </PERSON> plan, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> offered a new formula that would prevent taxation of inflation-caused gains and also give investors at least a slight break in the tax on their profits that represented a real increase in the value of property. However, there was no indication that <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s proposal had drawn any votes away from the <PERSON> Jenkins-Archer </PERSON> plan. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, D-Wis., who opposes a capital-gains cut, cautioned against concluding that the Jenkins-Archer amendment will carry the day `` We are beginning an education campaign'' to point out issues of fairness in connection with capital gains, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Time is on the side of the package that will be worked on by the chairman,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's very sensitive to the pressures.''

 Attorneys are haggling over millions of dollars in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' strike-bankruptcy case, but all <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovinger </PERSON> wants is the $ 3,720 she spent on now-useless Eastern tickets for her family. `` I'm a grandmother,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lovinger </PERSON>, 57, told a public meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors Wednesday. `` It's pretty horrible that big business can do this to me ... and I can be out this amount of money. I'm overwrought about it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lovinger </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, says she purchased 13 tickets for her children and grandchildren in January so they could fly from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for a family gathering in mid-April. Eastern's three unions struck March 4, grounding the Miami-based carrier and forcing it to seek the refuge of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Ms. <PERSON> Lovinger </PERSON> joined the thousands of other hapless ticketholders caught by the strike, hoping a federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> will make sure Eastern compensates them. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister carrier, has been honoring <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> tickets, but Ms. <PERSON> Lovinger </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> offered only to put her and relatives on standby status. She wants her money back or guaranteed seats. `` I need the tickets the way I bought them,' she told about 60 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorneys, creditors, shareholders and employees at Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. On July 21, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filed a proposed reorganization plan, which it said would provide for full repayment of the $ 3.3 billion owed to all creditors including ticketholders. Under the plan, people like Ms. <PERSON> Lovinger </PERSON> could exchange their tickets for cash with interest or more valuable tickets on the post-bankruptcy Eastern. But the plan must receive approval by the bankruptcy court and other creditors first, so Ms. <PERSON> Lovinger </PERSON> could be in for a long wait. `` This example is symptomatic of a problem we see coming up,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flug </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said of the grandmother's case. <PERSON> Flug </PERSON>, who also attended the Eastern meeting, said <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has heard of dozens of similar cases. Consumers Union, the non-profit consumer advocacy group that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, has asked the court to require Eastern to reimburse passengers before the company pays off other creditors.

The cable television retailer claimed it lost millions of calls and $ 500 million in potential sales in 1986 and early 1987 because <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> telephone equipment it contracted for could not handle the volume of calls. But after a six-week trial at <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the jury rejected charges of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and confidence, and breach of fiduciary duty against the telecommunications giant. Instead it awarded <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> $ 50 million each for damages to their reputation and credibility by <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and its two top executives on charges in a countersuit by <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based GTE. <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> was cited for $ 20 million of the total award with $ 40 million each against <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Paxson </PERSON>. Home Shopping immediately said it would appeal the decisions. The jury of four women and two men deliberated for about five hours over two days. `` We are very disappointed with the jury's verdict and we will appeal the decision immediately,'' said <PERSON> Nando </PERSON> <PERSON> DiFilippo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president and general counsel He said the network would maintain that the court should not have presented <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s libel and slander counterclaim to the jury. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carideo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> vice president and general counsel, said the verdict reassures `` the integrity of the companies,'' which the <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> suit `` had put at issue.'' Home Shopping merchandise may be bought by home viewers only while the item is being displayed on the screen. The network said it lost 42 million calls when as much as 50 percent of its incoming calls never got through to waiting sales operators because of the allegedlt faulty equipment. <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> filed its suit in Septmeber 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> denied any wrongdoing, contending there was nothing wrong with its equipment and it had not misled Home Shopping. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s countersuit maintained that the electronic retailer blamed the phone company for financial problems actually caused by mismanagement. The company argued that over-expansion, competition and customer dissatisfaction rather than ineffective equipment triggered <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> losses. In one year, the number of Home Shopping subscribers soared from 9 million to 46.5 million, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for a record $ 24.5 billion in April, said Wednesday it lost $ 309 million in the second quarter because of costs associated with the buyout.

 <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would sell its <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which the oil giant had spent 12 years and $ 200 million building into the largest such operation in the world. The sale to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, which has teamed up with <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> in a joint solar venture since 1987, was expected to be completed this fall, <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> said. Terms of the deal were n't announced. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION>, a pet project of former <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, had never turned a profit. But the company and solar industry observers said the small, quickly evolving solar industry continues to show great promise. They interpreted the sale as part of a back-to-basics trend in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil industry, and said <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>, with its telecommunications, power generation, electronics and other businesses, can better exploit solar technology than can <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a better fit in the <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> scheme of things ... a company that is into so many related industries,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. `` Our core business is oil, gas and petrochemicals, and we feel that Arco Solar is just not part of our long-term strategy for energy development.'' <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> operation will help the conglomerate develop solar energy worldwide as the technology is used increasingly in isolated areas without power from utilities. The solar industry boomed by 35 percent in 1988 to about $ 185 million in sales worldwide, said solar energy consultant <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` At the present time the producers of power modules ca n't keep up with demand. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION> had about $ 30 million of those sales _ a big chunk of the solar market, but a paltry fraction of the $ 18.8 billion generated by <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's seventh-largest oil company. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION>'s devices have ranged from small battery chargers to power modules for cars, boats, rooftops and mountain communications relay stations. It also operates two solar power `` farms'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a 1-megawatt facility in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and a 6.5-megawatt facility in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> did not buy those, and <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a buyer, <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. `` I think it's singular how long <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> has maintained interest in solar,'' said consultant <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, of Strategies Unlimited, a <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, market research firm that studies solar electric conversions. `` Since 1974 there have been a total of eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum companies involved in commercial or research and development of solar electric. At this present time there remain just two _ <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s solar subsidiary is <ORGANIZATION> Solarex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> solar company with sales <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> estimated at $ 18 million last year. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, company, said he remained optimistic about the industry. `` The technology has improved dramatically in the last five years,'' <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said. `` We've seen about a halving of our prices and manufacturing volumes are up dramatically.'' <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Solarex </ORGANIZATION>'s main products are the panels or `` modules'' that can be wired together in various ways and can be seen atop many roofs. They also power communications relay stations atop the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and Andes and ice plants for Egyptian fishermen whose catch would otherwise rot in the sun, <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> noted. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said he expects the next market for solar power to be in small power tools, appliances, outdoor lights and the like, just as solar-powered hand calculators and watches have become common. `` The fact that <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> is getting into it _ another blue-chip company _ it's an indication of the viability of the business,'' <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION>, which employs about 400 people, is based in <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION>, about 50 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> would retain Arco Solar's management and staff, continue operations in <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION> and honor all distributor marketing agreements. Since 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION> have operated <ORGANIZATION> PV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION>, making and selling solar products mainly to the auto industry based on thin film silicon technology licensed from Arco Solar. The joint venture has a factory in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and conducts research on solar technology. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer <PERSON> Lodwrick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said, `` Every effort was made to find a buyer with the management depth, financial resources, commitment to solar energy and willingness to retain the current management, staff and facilities. <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> met those criteria.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Wednesday to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for $ 2.4 billion in cash, capping a complete financial turnaround for the worldwide mining company. If approved by shareholders, the deal will expand <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION>'s mining operations and mark its return to nickel production. Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> is the world's second-largest nickel producer. <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest coal and aluminum producer, said it has secured financing needed to pay $ 2.8 billion, or $ 36.12 -LCB- a share, in Canadian currency for <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION>. The offer is worth about $ 2.4 billion, or $ 30.50, in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, an <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. The acquisition is subject to approval by Canadian regulatory authorities. `` <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> is an excellent organization with quality people and assets. Its acquisition will complement <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION>'s current metals businesses and position the company well to serve growing markets,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Born </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, chief executive and president. <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 741 million on revenue of $ 4.2 billion in 1988. In the first six months of this year, the company reported $ 245.1 million in profits on revenue of $ 2.06 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> shares closed up 12 -LCB- cents Wednesday at $ 25.50 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Trading in <LOCATION> Falconridge </LOCATION> shares was delayed until after the <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> announcement. The stock shot up after it began trading, closing at $ 36.62 -LCB-, up $ 6.37 -LCB-, on the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In the last year, <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> sought to expand operations and <PERSON> Born </PERSON> said it was interested in acquiring natural gas properties. The possibility of expansion seemed unlikely in 1985, when <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> ended four years with $ 1.7 billion in losses. In addition to ill-advised ventures into silver and energy, <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> rejected lucrative takeover offers from <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Its interest payments on debts totaled $ 200 million a year Born was hired in 1985 from a Canadian mining company to help turn the company. <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> then sold about half the subsidiaries contributing to its 1984 losses, pulling out of iron ore, nickel and agricultural chemicals production. The work force was cut to nearly half its 1981 peak of 20,385 workers. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> began making new acquisitions, particularly in coal and aluminum. The combination of cuts and purchases returned <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> to profitability in 1987 and its work force has grown again to about 20,000 worldwide. <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> is an international resource corporation that explores for, develops, mines, processes and markets metals and minerals. Its major product is nickel, but it also mines ferronickel, copper and zinc. <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> has 9,500 employees with major operations in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION>, a supplier of metals and energy, has as its major products aluminium, coal, gold and molybdenum. The <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> deal is conditioned on acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION>'s offer by at least two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> shareholders No deadline has been set for tendering the company's 79 million fully diluted shares, the <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. If the deal goes through, <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to make an additional offer to acquire all untendered shares. <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> recently moved its headquarters from <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but maintains corporate offices here. <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> immediately implemented a shareholder rights plan to defend against hostile offers. The measures would give existing shareholders the right to purchase additional stock at a bargain rate if another party acquires at least 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> stock. The so-called `` poison pill'' plan will expire in 120 days if the deal is not approved by shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> said in a joint statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the company abandoned the nickel business because it was only a refiner and not a miner. She said <ORGANIZATION> Falconbridge </ORGANIZATION> presented <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> with a `` quality position'' in which it will both mine and refine nickel.

<TEXT>
 Negotiators for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union began talks Wednesday on how much money will go into the next union contract and how it will be distributed. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON>, business representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' District 70 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, would n't reveal the contents of the initial proposal the union made to the aerospace company He called it `` fair, reasonable and justified.'' The Machinists' current 3-year pact with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> expires Oct. 3. Industry analysts say the union is in a good position to extract favorable terms from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. A strike is unlikely, they say, primarily because <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is already having difficulty delivering airplanes on time. `` The unions have a heck of a lever this time around, particularly after being given the wire brush the last two times around,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, an aerospace analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials declined comment on any aspect of the negotiations `` We do not discuss any of that in the press,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said getting a general wage increase is the top priority of the union. The Machinists at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> have not had a general wage increase for six years, with the union settling in each of the last two contracts for lump-sum bonuses. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, analysts say, is likely to again offer substantial bonuses in an attempt to avoid a general wage increase that would also raise the costs of overtime and benefits, and lock the company into higher expenses even if economic conditions should turn sour. `` What <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> would like to do is give the employees a part of the boom times, but not get stuck when the weak times come,'' said analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bosworth </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is based. The expiring contract paid workers a 12 percent bonus in 1986 and 5 percent the following two years. <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said surveys of union members showed that as many as 65 percent of them support the goal of a general wage increase and that such sentiment was even stronger in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. Since the last contract was negotiated three years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been amassing record sales and profits on the strength of unprecedented orders for new airliners. Just last week, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> announced its earnings for the first six months of 1989 were $ 356 million, a 20 percent increase over a year earlier. The company has nearly $ 3.7 billion in cash and investments and an order backlog valued at nearly $ 68 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has until Aug. 9 to make a counterproposal. <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said he expects the negotiations to be tough. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has a long history of taking you right down to the wire, and we'll probably be meeting on Oct. 3,'' he said

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials at the world's two largest commodities exchanges moved quickly Wednesday to bolster public confidence after a federal grand jury indicted 46 traders on charges of making illegal trades. But ordinary traders at bars near the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in the downtown <LOCATION> LaSalle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> financial district took a more low-key view of the indictments. Several traders refused to comment on the indictments, while others expressed mixed opinions about the federal probe that resulted in charges ranging from tax fraud to racketeering. Those traders willing to comment refused to identify themselves. `` If they're dirty, then they deserve it,'' one trader shouted over his shoulder as he walked out of The Trade Inn across from the Board of Trade building. But other traders questioned the validity of the indictments, which resulted from a 2 -LCB- - year undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation at the two exchanges The charges involve such violations as pre-arranged trading, altering trading records and withholding customer orders from the market in order to dole them out to compatriots. From the indictments emerge a picture of several dozen traders, none of whom are considered especially influential, who allegedly conspired to skim profits from customers' accounts and hide the profits from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Some traders at the Limit Up Bar in the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> building portrayed several of those indicted as basically honest brokers who were not smart enough to cheat. `` There are things that look real dishonest that are done for the good of the customers,'' said one trader, who has been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for 10 years. He refused to elaborate on what practices he meant. The trader said he thought the federal investigation has focused so far on traders who had done little wrong. `` They're taking honest people and turning them into crooks,'' said the trader. `` If they're looking for something bigger, that's fine, great. The trader and two colleagues sitting at the bar denied ever breaking exchange rules and defended the record of most traders. `` That's very good if all they can find is 24 bad apples'' out of the 2,724 seats on the Mercantile exchange, he said. The government announced indictments of 22 traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and 24 at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. The exchanges were not accused of wrongdoing and neither were any of the scores of brokerage firms whose customers were allegedly cheated. Officials at both exchanges said those traders under indictment would be barred from trading except for their own personal accounts. When asked about the number of indictments, <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> told a news conference that `` one was too many'' and vowed to protect the integrity of the exchange. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> had launched its own investigation of traders before reports about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe surfaced in January, but was asked by federal authorities to hold off while the government investigation continued. CBOT President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said the exchange has since moved to improve its computer surveillance system so that it will be able to audit all transactions within one business day and stiffen its maximum fines for violations from $ 75,000 to $ 250,000. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said the board would conduct its own investigation into the practices of the indicted traders and revoke the trading privileges of anyone who pleads guilty or is convicted on charges stemming from the probe. `` Without integrity being a major part of the way we do business, we can not exist,'' <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> told the news conference. At the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the executive committee, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldermann </PERSON>, chairman of the board of governors, issued a statement promising to deal `` severely'' with any member found guilty of the federal charges. They said the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> had commissioned a special committee to review all trading practices.

 <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> on Wednesday credited his new all-movie cable channel, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, with boosting <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s revenues and profit in the second quarter. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 5.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $ 25.9 million for the same quarter a year earlier. However, it reported a net loss per common share of 12 cents in this year's second quarter due to the payment of dividends and the accumulation of discount on its Class B preferred stock. Quarterly revenues were up 33 percent, to $ 264.5 million from $ 199.3 million. For the six months ended June 30, net income was $ 5.1 million, or a loss of 37 cents a share after an extraordinary item, compared with a loss of $ 40 million for the same period in 1988. Revenues were $ 496.5 million, up 30 percent from revenues of $ 381.9 million for the same period a year earlier. `` The addition of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> to our already successful lineup of basic cable networks has lifted our quarterly operating profit to an all-time high,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, chairman of TBS. `` We are particularly pleased that our improved performance is the result of contributions from all four basic cable networks, confirming our belief that each network remains attractive to advertisers and viewers alike,'' he said.
