<HEAD>Former Broker Pleads Guilty To Illegal Trading Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former broker pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges that he defrauded his employer of more than $ 1 million in a scheme involving illegal trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a former trader in <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index-futures contracts, pleaded guilty to two counts of commodities fraud, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Alesia </PERSON> set sentencing for April 7, <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, a former employee of <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine. Under a plea agreement, <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> said, the government reserves the right to grant <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> was expelled by the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> last March and fined $ 100,000 on charges of fraudulent trading. The charges to which he pleaded guilty were brought last week. The plea agreement states that he defrauded <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> by diverting money from profitable S & amp; P futures trades to four accounts between January 1984 and July 1986. Authorities charged that <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> split the profits with four other people after diverting the money into their accounts. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>'s share, 35 percent of the profits, amounted to $ 350,000, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> said <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> already has paid back some of the money. `` He and the others have made substantial restitution,'' the attorney said. Pearl would not say whether the other four would be charged. But he said the investigation is continuing. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> was among 10 men charged Feb. 9 with fraudulent trading in commodity futures. The men were accused in four separate schemes _ one of which, authorities said, involved the use of wigs, makeup and phony credentials to gain access to trading pits. But <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> was involved only in the scheme to which he pleaded guilty Tuesday.

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> did n't mind playing two squares in the comedy hymn to marital fidelity, `` She's Having a Baby. In fact, they liked the movie's emphasis on old-style morals. `` Old-fashioned is new-fashioned, let's face it,'' <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said. Director-writer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> `` is basically an old-values type of guy in all his movies,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. And his story of a young couple, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, is `` a tribute to suburbia'' and to the virtue of commitment. Though the actors are young _ Bacon is 29, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> is 26 _ both are examples of another old-fashioned virtue: hard work. They recently talked about just how hard it was to bring out `` Baby.'' One scene _ the <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>' wedding _ was shot over 26 consecutive hours. It was filmed in the <ORGANIZATION> Winnetka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, which was available for only a limited time. Two versions of the scene were filmed: a straight-forward account of the wedding, and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>'s hallucination about what his wedding vows really mean. `` <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON> thou listen to endless conversations about children's clothes and decorator checkbooks? the minister asks in the fantasy version. The marathon session demanded a lot of Bacon. `` I actually fell asleep on my feet,'' he said. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, who previously appeared in `` Diner'' and `` Footloose,'' is on the screen in almost every frame of the film. In one scene, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> sits outside the church with his best man, who tries to tempt him not to get married. The struggle, <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> says, was to win the audience's sympathy, despite the fact that his character is on the brink of jilting the beautiful <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON>. `` I really wanted him to seem like a little boy in a monkey suit, and that was difficult,'' <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>'s travails were more subtle. Her character, <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON>, appears bland. But she's not, said the actress. <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> is `` very strong, although she does n't necessarily appear on the surface to be strong,'' said <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, who first drew attention in the industry with her portrayal of <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s girlfriend in 1980 in the Academy Award-winning `` Ordinary People. The next year, she had a supporting actress <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> nomination for her role in `` Ragtime.'' `` She's a person you would n't ever think twice about,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. But before the end of the movie, `` The door opens on her soul and you see how much there is she has to offer.'' Both actors lauded <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' direction. `` As strong and independent as I come off on the set, I need a director who will say, ` OK, that's good, you got it,''' <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> did that for him. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> agreed. `` I always felt supported and I always knew that he would guide me.'' By the end of the filming, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> trusted <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> to improvise. One touching and funny result has <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> trying natural childbirth methods _ massaging his abdomen and panting _ while <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> gives birth in another room. `` By that point I'd been playing this character so many times and in so many different situations that I really felt that I knew him and <PERSON> John </PERSON> knew him. ... And he just kind of said, ` We'll turn the camera on and you just hang out in the room and do what you would do.'' The tension <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> has felt in front of the camera in other movies did n't apply in this one, he said. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> sort of blows all that tension right out of the water,'' by letting the camera roll during retakes instead of shouting, `` Action!'' or `` Cut!'' a lot. The atmosphere during filming was relaxed enough for <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> to bring along his dog, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, whom he calls `` a <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION> deceiver'' _ a mutt that's part Lab. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> and <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> are both accomplished on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage, and are used to feeding on the energy of an audience. But in a way, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said, the director filled that function. `` When he was looking at me he would see <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON>, he would n't see <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>,'' she said.

<HEAD>After 25 Years, Cop-Killer Case Still Stirs Emotions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The letters, phone calls and telegrams come from across the nation, but the message to police and state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> members is almost always the same: <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> must not go free. Nearly 25 years after <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> and an accomplice shot Sgt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Voto </PERSON> and officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tedesco </PERSON> to death at point-blank range in a nightclub here, emotions still run high. From an accountant in nearby <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>: `` The courts and the parole system should start to recognize the danger which these criminals present to society. If he killed in cold blood two police officers who were in uniform, how can those of us who are citizens in plain clothes be safe?'' From a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman: `` I do n't want to hear that he is a model prisoner who is now a writer, a painter. ... They are forgetting he has one other glaring accomplishment, and that is that he committed a cold-blooded murder of two human beings.'' The prospect of release has sparked a petition drive, legislative proposals, a letter-writing campaign and a candlelight rally by more than 1,500 people to convince the <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> must remain behind bars. The case has also revived debate over an old question: When has a murderer finally paid his debt to society? <ORGANIZATION> Paramus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, a leader of the campaign against parole, said many feel `` the people who commit the violent acts are n't getting punishment that fits the crime.'' `` They want to see pure, unadulterated punishment,'' he added. `` Do n't say ` life in prison' for someone and then let him out 15, 20 or 25 years later.'' On Aug. 26, 1963, <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> were at the Angel Lounge celebrating a robbery. When <PERSON> Voto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tedesco </PERSON> arrived to investigate a disturbance, <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> surprised them, partially stripped them and shot them. <PERSON> Falco </PERSON> was killed the next day by police trying to capture him. <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> was caught, convicted and sentenced to die in the electric chair. The sentence was commuted to life when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972. In 1980, the full <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> voted to release <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON>, provided that he make restitution to the families of his victims. The decision sparked an outcry, and in 1982 the board voted to keep <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> locked up for 10 more years, a term that was cut almost in half through credits for good behavior and work. A two-member panel decided last month that he should be paroled March 15, but the full board has decided to review the decision. A Parole Board official, citing policy, declined to explain the decision. However, under state law <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> can be paroled only if he shows `` no substantial likelihood of future criminal activity'' and proves he has `` made progression in rehabilitating himself.'' From 1978 to 1982 <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON> was granted regular furloughs from prison, which ended after the controversy over his parole. In 1980, he married the community college English professor who had edited his prison writings into a book. <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON>, 50, is now at the medium-security Riverfront State Prison in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, and declined an interview request. In a 1986 interview he said he had no recollection of the murders and believed his freedom was long overdue. He works in the prison canteen storeroom and participates in a program that tries to convince juvenile delinquents, in a `` low key'' way, to change their ways, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON>. Victims' rights organizations, <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Voto </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, now police chief in this small blue-collar community, have been at the forefront of efforts to block parole. Recently, <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Voto </PERSON> appeared on <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s television talk show The next day about 1,000 people called the board from across the country to oppose <PERSON> Trantino </PERSON>'s release. `` He's a classic con artist,'' <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said. `` I have dealt with people in my many years as a cop and there's no question in my mind that if they release him he will kill again.'' The case has struck a chord among family members of crime victims. `` Most of the letters that come in to me thank me for picking up the fight against coddling prisoners. There's too much concern for these people,'' <PERSON> Voto </PERSON> said. `` Why should a man walk out when he was sentenced to death? There is rehabilitation, and I am for it, but not in these types of cases ... not an outright killer, a cold-blooded killer.''

 Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> took in stride his bottom-of-the-pile finish in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary Tuesday, saying he was ready to shine in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, `` in my backyard.'' With returns nearly complete in the Republican primary, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was last among the five contenders. `` We played in <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s backyard -LRB- in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB- and I beat <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> there,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` We played in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, which according to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is his backyard, and he won convincingly. `` Tomorrow morning, I go into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and they're going to be playing in my backyard,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in a concession speech at a hotel ballroom as several hundred supporters cheered, stomped and chanted, `` We want <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>!'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 57, with his wife, <PERSON> Dede </PERSON>, at his side, said: `` I'm throwing the gauntlet down to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is the first Super Tuesday state, and I'm going to beat you there convincingly.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Republicans actually vote the Saturday before Super Tuesday, when 20 states hold caucuses or primaries. The crowd cheered again when one supporter yelled out, `` You've got the biggest backyard, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>! Earlier, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s national field director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON>, acknowledged that after <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s surprise second-place showing in the Feb. 8 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, `` We were hoping to do better here.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>: `` Our polling showed we would have a strong third place. We came up very short on that.'' <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s showing on two controversies in the past week: <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s charges about allegations made by a group from which <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> distanced himself and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s claim during a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> debate Sunday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has `` nukes in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was hounded Monday by questions on his statement during the debate, and subsequently said his was not `` a categorical statement per se.'' But in his concession remarks, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he will meet with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this week, and `` It may be that something happened in the debate here which may be the key to victory in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' Later he said: `` We've got an issue that came out of here on the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> missiles. I was n't expecting it to play this way, but I'm getting reports from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that the people down there are with me on this issue So New Hampshire may have given me the key issue to win the two biggest states in the South.''

<TEXT>
 It was once known as the Black Country because of its long winters, harsh terrain and hard life. Even at the dawn of this century, it still was a land of barbarian tribes and powerful feudal warriors _ one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s last frontiers. Warrior clans and impoverished peasants lived in isolation among its vast mountain ranges. But it had a bucolic tranquility and Japanese poured in from all over to enjoy what <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> once was _ volcanic hot springs and rugged seascapes, folk crafts and villages, old temples and teahouses, well-tended apple orchards and rice fields. This is <PERSON> Tohoku </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION>'s formal name, and it takes up the entire northern end of <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main island. But <PERSON> Tohoku </PERSON>'s leaders are planning to catapult <PERSON> Tohoku </PERSON> into the 21st century, turning the region into a hub of technological progress, filled with high-tech factories, seaports and telecommunications centers. If that happens, some fear, <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION>'s culture and way of life will vanish. Some of it already has. New highways and high-speed train lines have brought modern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> closer to <LOCATION> Tohoku </LOCATION>. Thousands upon thousands come to its ski resorts and lakes, snowscapes and primieval marshes in three national parks, all offering a respite from the urban plain around <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a little over 100 miles to the south. <LOCATION> Sendai </LOCATION> is now <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION>'s largest city, with 700,000 residents. Devastated by World War II bombing, its broad tree-lined boulevards are a rare product of postwar city planning. Between <PERSON> Tohoku </PERSON>'s growing cities lie vast wooded mountains and cultivated plains, where people carry on a simpler, more traditional Japanese lifestyle. Most live in houses that are huge by comparison with those in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but they lack central heating and flush toilets. People's lives are suited to the seasons: The cold winter months are spend clustered around quilt-covered heaters called kotatsu, and observing the traditional festivals and rituals tied to the planting and harvesting of rice But in <LOCATION> Sendai </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, a powerful business alliance, is planning a leap into the 21st century. If the federation has its way, rustic northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will become a network of technolopolises, marinopolises, teletopias and a `` magmapolis'' _ modern cities based on high technology, seaports, telecommunications and power generation and tourism tied to volcanic activity. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s `` Furusato -LRB- Hometown -RRB- Concept'' _ a plan to establish centers of industry and culture in rural <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ is further encouragement for <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION>'s planners. More than 34 foreign firms and some of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading electronics companies already have moved their factories from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to industrial parks in <LOCATION> Tohoku </LOCATION>, attracted by tax incentives, lower land costs and abundant water and energy. Real estate cost an average $ 9 a square foot in <LOCATION> Tohoku </LOCATION> in 1987, compared with $ 110.50 in suburban <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Several company presidents said fresh, skilled labor drew their firms to <LOCATION> Tohoku </LOCATION>, where the people are known for their `` serious character and diligence.'' Federation officials maintain that high-tech industrial development poses little threat to the Tohoku's environment. But opponents claim the air already has become polluted around heavily used roads and that even `` clean'' semiconductor factories must use dangerous chemicals. About one-tenth of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 121 million people _ the same number that live in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> _ live in all of <LOCATION> Tohoku </LOCATION>, which makes up 20 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s land area. <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamakawa </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> federation </ORGANIZATION> and president of the region's largest corporation, <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, says <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION> is an attractive alternative to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s congestion and high prices. `` People used to say <PERSON> Tohoku </PERSON> was a barbarian hinterland,'' he said. `` They certainly ca n't say that anymore.'' Nearby <PERSON> Matsushima </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> -RRB- is still considered one of the most beautiful spots in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast to north and south is a mass of gray factories and shipyards. Modernization has brought flashy department stores and hotels to <LOCATION> Sendai </LOCATION>, along with subways, urban sprawl and traffic jams. But even in quieter, less developed areas, life is changing. A few hours north of <LOCATION> Sendai </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hiraizumi </LOCATION>, taxi driver <PERSON> Kirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoyanagi </PERSON>, in blue uniform and white gloves, talks of how he returned to his native town from `` miserably lonely'' <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after living there almost 10 years, to marry and raise his family. <PERSON> Aoyanagi </PERSON> now guides tourists through ancient temples and describes the floods, wars and fires that destroyed most of <PERSON> Hiraizumi </PERSON>, a city built around 1100 by the powerful <PERSON> Fujiwara </PERSON> clan that was once a center of political power. <PERSON> Aoyanagi </PERSON> says he and others ca n't live by farming alone, and need factory jobs. But he worries that old traditions are disappearing as <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION> grows more modern and less isolated. `` It's not like it used to be,'' he said. `` People are becoming self-centered just like in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The younger generation is completely different.'' A giant <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>'s face loomed out of a nearby cliff in a quiet mountain valley. Below, a group of farmers, in traditional aprons and kerchiefs, worked at rethatching a farmhouse roof _ a picture of the past. `` I want to keep <PERSON> Tohoku </PERSON> a good place to live,'' <PERSON> Aoyanagi </PERSON> said, `` where people care about each other, and not just their money.''

In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> on Friday, troops fired rubber bullets and smashed windows with their rifle butts to break into <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and detain four Arabs suspected of throwing stones. A wall was smeared with blood where docors said the Arabs were beaten and six windows were broken, one punctured with a rubber bullet. Besides treating scores of victims, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> hospitals have served as havens for Arab protesters trying to elude detention after anti-Israeli demonstrations. <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> has been a staging ground for riots by hundreds of Palestinians who hurled firebombs and stones at soldiers. Troops stormed the hospital twice within two days in December and shot dead two Arabs. `` This is a situation worse than on the TV serial ` M-A-S-H,''' said Dr. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, a member of a fact-finding team from the <ORGANIZATION> Boston-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> that visited hospitals in the territories. `` People are stitching wounds without gloves and without anesthesia. These hospitals are completely inadequate for the treatment of this kind of trauma and do not meet an acceptable standard,'' <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said last Wednesday. As <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> spoke at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION>, a large ginger-colored cat wandered through wards that reeked with the smell of urine and feces. Thick fetid water filled clogged-up toilets and sinks in the bathroom and a pool of open sewage ran on the floor. At <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> last week, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter watched doctors stitch up the wounds of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> patients lying on blood-stained stretchers on the emergency room floor because all the beds were filled. A doctor stitched shut a deep gash on the head of a 20-year-old man shaking with pain, while in a stretcher beside him another doctor set a man's broken forearm. `` We work with the minimal medical standards,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassih </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION>, which like <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> is Israeli-run. `` Every time we operate there is a shortage.'' `` One day there was no clean linen. Another day, no water. Then no towels, no sterile instruments. Sometimes we work without electricity or have no silk thread for stitches,'' said <PERSON> Yassih </PERSON>, one of four Palestinian surgeons who perform most operations at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yassih </PERSON> said he discharged 45 Palestinians with beating injuries, including 24 with broken limbs, after only a few hours of treatment last Wednesday. `` There just are n't enough beds,'' <PERSON> Yassih </PERSON> said. `` We get more and more cases every day. I have to keep at least 15 beds free for emergencies.'' Lying in rows of narrow metal frame beds were dozens of Palestinians recovering from more serious beating injuries and gunshot wounds. One 17-year-old Palestinian student, Jihad <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Achronz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, was paralyzed from the waist down from a bullet wound that punctured a spinal nerve. Another 14-year-old, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalud </PERSON> of Jabaliya refugee camp, suffered epileptic seizures, incontinence and paralysis of his lower spine and upper leg from a bullet wound to the back. <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>, 40, screamed as doctors lifted him to examine a swollen black bruise from his neck to lower back. Both <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>'s arms and legs were in casts, his bandaged head had 12 deep gashes, and several ribs were fractured. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said he was beaten by 10 soldiers who accused him of raising the outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag on a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> street. <PERSON> Yasih </PERSON> said beating victims often were from the same family or section of a refugee camp and frequently were clubbed at night. He said he treated 12 members of the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> family from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, six of whom had broken limbs. `` We find people injured in the same places over and over: the upper chest, legs, back, knees, arms, hands and elbows,'' <PERSON> Yassih </PERSON> said. He said about half the victims treated at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> had broken legs and 60 percent had broken hands. <PERSON> Yassih </PERSON> also said many Palestinians were reluctant to go to <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> or other Israeli-run hospitals because hospital officials are required to give patients' names to the army, which patrols outside the hospital gate. Three days earlier, troops entered the hospital and took three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> patients from their beds, reinforcing Palestinians' fears, the doctor said.

 ABC only got a silver in the ratings the first week of Winter Olympics coverage, but <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' was golden for the first time since August, snapping <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' 20-week win streak. The first two nights of the Olympics, Saturday and Sunday, varied widely in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings, but according to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> averaged higher than the first two nights of the 1984 games. An estimated 25 million viewers saw Sunday night's coverage, featuring pairs figure skating, putting it in the top 10 with a 19.7 rating and a 30 share. But Saturday's coverage of hockey was in the bottom 10 with a 9.9 rating and 17 share. The rating is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are tuned to that program. The first two nights of the 1984 games were a Tuesday and a Wednesday, and had a combined rating of 13.8 compared to 15.5 for this year, said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s highest rated show of the week was n't the Olympics, but the conclusion of the two-part miniseries `` Elvis and Me,'' the highest-rated miniseries so far this season. But <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> handily won the week ending Feb. 14, with an average prime-time rating of 16.2. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 14.9. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was third with 14.2. After winning 19 of the 21 weeks so far in the season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has an average rating of 16.4, and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> are tied with 13.6. The 10 top-rated shows of the week were: `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Elvis and Me, Part 2'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Growing Pains'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Night Court'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` L.A. Law'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and the Winter Olympics Sunday coverage on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s new `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON> as a chameleon private eye, premiered last Friday with so-so numbers, ranking 49th. The lowest rated shows of the week were: `` Our House,'' Winter Olympics Saturday coverage, `` West 57th,'' `` The Law and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>,'' `` Decision'88 _ The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caucus </LOCATION>,'' `` Star Trek II: The Wrath of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>,'' `` The Thorns,'' `` 48 Hours in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' `` Sledge Hammer!'' and `` The Charmings.'' For the week ending Feb. 12, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had an average rating of 11.8 and a 20 share. The `` CBS Evening News'' had an 11.1 and 19. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.9 and 19. Network analysts had no immediate explanation for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s showing. However, last week's ratings could have been affected by coverage of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential race. `` We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or coverage of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, and with live programming like the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hearings and political coverage,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Adde </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s prime-time special on <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> ranked a respectable 44 out of 68. It followed the conclusion of `` Elvis and Me.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> coverage ranked 63rd. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> delayed its coverage of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> until 11:30 p.m. EST, after prime time. The last time <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was first in news ratings was the week of Aug. 10, 1987.

 The 130 Palestinian deportees whose voyage home was aborted by the bombing of their ship this week include prominent <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> proponents of peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well as others who advocate violence. Most were expelled from their Israeli-occupied homeland without trial, under a process considered illegal by virtually every nation except <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> gathered the deportees and hundreds of observers in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> for a trip back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> aboard a `` ship of return.'' Their goal was to focus attention on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy of exiling Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Participants said the voyage would have been probably the largest non-violent action attempted by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have chosen to go back with no guns, no explosives, not even any stones,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON>, deported mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION>. Israeli leaders had vowed to block the ship from reaching <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s shores. On Monday, before the deportees could fly from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to the port of <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, to begin the protest voyage, an explosion left a hole below the waterline of the ferry bought for the trip. A day before, three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were killed in a car bombing also in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of responsibility. The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the ship Exodus, in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned back by British forces as they tried to reach <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had called the PLO-sponsored trip a `` declaration of war'' on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and branded participants as `` terrorists and those who want to kill us, every one of us.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said in 1985 that deportations were effective `` for those who instigate and call for participation in terror, even though they themselves are not active.'' The same 1945 British Mandate laws used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for many of the deportations were applied against <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders who led guerrilla bands that assassinated and bombed British soldiers and Arabs in the 1940s. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> denounced the deportations in 1980 and again last month, saying they contravened the 1949 <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>. `` Their goal is to leave our people leaderless,'' said <PERSON> Abdul-Jawad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, exiled in 1973, a year after his re-election as mayor of <LOCATION> Al-Bireh </LOCATION>. Among those listed for the trip are the president of <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> mayor of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and the assistant Anglican archbishop of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON>, expelled in 1980 and elected to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Committee in 1984, often has been suggested as a moderate <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiator for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> described himself as `` a non-violent activist,'' and said he was never told specifically what triggered his deportation. He recalled that Israeli military officials had summoned him to warn against founding agricultural cooperatives and ordered him to stop protesting on behalf of villagers outside <LOCATION> Al-Bireh </LOCATION>. Like <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON> and many other exiles, <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said he favors acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> alongside a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. `` Two states to live in peace together in the same country,'' was the way Anglican Bishop <PERSON> Eliya </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON> put it. Not all deportees agree with that view. Four Palestinians expelled last month issued a statement shortly after arriving in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, saying Islamic radicals there should `` threaten to execute'' three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hostages if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> kept up its crackdown on Palestinians in the occupied lands. More than 50 Palestinians have been killed in rioting in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since Dec. 8, most of them by Israeli gunfire. According to Palestinian and <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> officials, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported up to 3,000 Palestinians. Many deportees say they want peace with Israelis, but within an Arab-dominated Palestinian state. `` My brother and my grandfather and his father and my children were born in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nashaat </PERSON> <PERSON> Labadeh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> school principal. `` This is our land. <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> belongs to us.'' He said he was deported largely for his involvement in a 1968 teachers' strike against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attempt to impose its school books on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> pupils. <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not close its doors to those who have attacked it in the past. `` Even if we were terrorists, and we are demanding a peaceful solution, I think we are the people to make peace with,'' he said. `` You do n't make peace with your friends. You make peace with your enemies.''

<HEAD>City Transit Executive Pledges To Catch Saboteurs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A city official says transit agency employees are suspected sabotaging safety devices on train doors. `` This appears to be an insider problem, someone who obviously knows enough about cars to disable them,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s senior deputy executive director in charge of maintenance. Inspectors at a rail yard discovered the vandalism, involving the air-filled rubber edges that prevent doors from closing on passengers, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Over the weekend, 25 doors on 18 cars were vandalized, he said. Air hoses either were disconnected or cut cleanly where they connect to a compressor, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said Monday. On Tuesday, crews found 11 new cases of apparent tampering, including five instances of damage to cars that had been repaired since the weekend, he said. There were no passenger injuries linked to the faulty doors. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has been very outspoken about the agency's problems since coming to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> a month ago from a similar post in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Last fall, the transit authority suspected employee sabotage when fuses necessary for emergency brake systems were missing in 100 cars. An investigation failed to produce any suspects.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got the win he so badly needed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Republican presidential primary Tuesday and proclaimed `` reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> fumed over what he called campaign distortions and told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` Quit lying about my record.'' `` Thank you, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, apt words of gratitude to the state that revived his presidential hopes. `` On to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where we're going to rise again.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign of distorting his record in a flurry of late television commercials aired in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said the ads unfairly accused him of backing an oil import fee and trying to raise taxes. After complaining for much of the evening, he was asked if he had anything to say to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a live interview with both men on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` Yeah, quit lying about my record,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` I'm not for raising anybody's taxes and he knows that; I'm not advocating a $ 10 oil import fee, and he knows that _ but they were on the ads all weekend.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also said he regretted not answering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> more forcefully during the waning days of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign, saying he had been `` too kind.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led with 38 percent to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 29 percent, with all precincts reporting. The remaining three <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates lagged far behind _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> at 13 percent, former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> at 10 percent and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> at 10 percent A sixth candidate, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, dropped out of the race Friday and registered less than 1 percent. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> claimed he was in third place and sought to make that sound like a victory. `` We won the contest for the conservative wing, and now we're going to contest fo the whole nomination of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> looked ahead to primaries in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, saying he had competed in <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s backyard of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` Tomorrow morning we go into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and they're going to be playing in my backyard,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. He pointed to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which holds a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary three days before the rest of the South votes on Super Tuesday March 8. `` I'm going to beat you there convincingly,'' he said to his rivals. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> also contended he was in the running with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> for third place. He called it `` a virtual tie'' among those three and said, `` That's got to be good.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said: `` It's better to win, and I congratulate the winner. I can stand here with my head held high.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had distorted his record by accusing him of backing tax increases. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who was battling a reputation as a slashing campaigner earned in his 1976 vice presidential race, suggested he may come back at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the campaign turns to the South in the coming three weeks. `` I think we should have answered the charges. I mean, I think you can be too kind to your opponent and we were,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` They kept saying <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> wants to raise taxes. They know that was not accurate. ... We wanted to keep it positive and see if it worked. `` It's unfortunate that the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who knows better, would sink to that level,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Asked later about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s accusing remark, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know what he's talking about. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued a statement quoting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> four times over the last six months saying he would support the oil tax. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has said he would consider the oil import fee but would rebate the fee to homeowners who use oil for heat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory came after his once-strong advantage in the polls had evaporated following his dismal showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> a week ago. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> forces pointed to that comeback, even as it fell short. `` We were down more than 20 points eight days ago,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>. `` To have come this close is a tremendous commentary on <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and also ... on the softness of the vice president's supporters. `` If he is going to have this kind of a problem in the South ... he's got a real problem,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` things have dramatically turned around'' for him in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, just as they did for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pointed cheerfully to the traditional first returns that were counted just after midnight in tiny Dixville Notch in the state's northern mountains. There he was a winner, with 11 votes to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 6. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s once-substantial lead in polls in the state evaporated following <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s two-to-one victory over him in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses a week earlier. But daily polling by the television networks indicated the trend to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> tailed off by the weekend and the race stabilized into a virtual dead heat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also found comfort in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s history of rejecting <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> winners _ including himself in 1980. `` He did what I did in 1980,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` He won in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and came in and talked about momentum. I did what Presidnt <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did. He came in and started talking the issues'' after losing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> searched urgently following his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> debacle for a way to better deliver his message _ that he is the logical heir to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative legacy. He was an insulated candidate who rarely made contact with reporters in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a time when he was beset with questions over his role in sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But with his politial future on the line after the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> defeat, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began asking for votes with apparent emotion and uncharacteristically climbed into the cab of a big truck and drove a forklift to try to display a common man's touch.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> claimed `` a great victory'' in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential primary Tuesday, moving to the front of the Democratic field with the backing of his neighbors. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> _ the winner last week in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses _ held onto the No. 2 spot, besting Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> for the second time in a row. `` It's really a great victory in many ways,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` because these are the people who know me best and they had to test me, not as neighbor, but as a presidential candidate. `` It's just a terrific boost. Obviously, it's going to be very important as we go into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>,'' he said. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor would not claim the front-runner's crown: `` I'm wary of that label.'' With all precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 36 percent, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 20 percent and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 17 percent. Further back were <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 8 percent, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> at 7 percent, former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> at 5 percent and former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> at 4 percent. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he did well across the state, exaggerating his showing a bit by claiming, `` The only thing we did n't carry was the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburbs.'' `` About a week ago, they said we could n't compete in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. Now, he declared, `` It appears that we've got a Dukakis-Gephardt race in the rest of the country, but that could change.'' And the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman said money is not a problem. `` We're raising money at a good clip,'' he said. `` We are going to be fine for Super Tuesday.'' That was not the case for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, whose campaign was alrady $ 500,000 in debt before the primary. `` This is not helping,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` From the financial point of view, if I were 3 percentage points ahead instead of 3 points behind, it would make a huge difference in collecting money.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> was next-to-last and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> last, but both refused to end their campaigns. `` This nomination is not won in one week or 30 days, it's going to be a six-month campaign,'' said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in 1984. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who re-entered the race saying `` let the voters decide,'' admitted he would have to start doing better: `` It will take at least 30 to 60 days to determine whether or not I can put together a viable candidacy.'' Asked if he was going to withdraw, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, `` No way. I'm going to move on to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a couple of days and call and talk to my supporters all over the country and ask them this question: how ... can we keep this reform movement alive Should I wage a guerilla campaign or should I withdraw or do something else?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was satisfied with his showing here. `` Our message has won ... They outspent me 10-to-1. And yet a poor campaign, a rich message has been successful in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he did better than anticipated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and had no regrets about doing little campaigning there. `` We made a decision not to spent a million dollars on two or three delegates. We're saving that for the 1,400 delegates here in the Super Tuesday states,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He was the only candidate who was n't in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Tuesday night. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had been concentrating their fire on each other until the final weekend, when both switched to ads attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I have n't been watching a lot of television lately, but I'm told people have been saying some pretty nasty things about me,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` I assume that's going to take its toll.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was angered at <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s ad, which suggested he is a technocrat who does n't care about people. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> `` obviously does not know what he's talking about,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said.

 Leaving the snows of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> behind, the presidential candidates set their sights today on the next big test _ the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, with its high-stakes Super Tuesday contests looming three weeks away. `` On to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where we're going to rise again,'' said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, fresh from his revival in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Republican rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> threatened to shatter what his campaign called a `` myth of invincibility'' surrounding the vice president's organization in the South. The change in scenery could n't come too soon for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> after his last-place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a Virginian, consoled his followers by saying, `` Tomorrow morning we go into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and they're going to be playing in my backyard.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, coming off a strong first-place finish in his neighboring state, was conceding nothing to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a Tennessean who is banking on his native Dixie, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has a strong base in the region's large black population. `` Some people have been asking how a New Englander can hope to do well on Super Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The fact of the matter is, I do n't have a Southern strategy. I do n't have a Northern strategy. I have an American strategy.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, was the only one of the candidates not in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Tuesday night. `` We made a decision not to spend a million dollars on two or three delegates,'' he told supporters. After <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, several candidates were heading to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where lower-stakes contests are scheduled between now and March 8. But the big attention-grabber is Super Tuesday, March 8, when 20 states, most of them in the South, stage primaries or caucuses. The delegate prize: 1,307 Democrats, or more than half of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination, and 700 Republicans, also more than of the 1,139 needed to nominate. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has a favorite line about his decision to bypass <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and run a limited campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>: `` If you're going to go duck hunting, you go where the ducks are. If you're hunting for delegates, you go where the delegates are.'' Super Tuesday, in a sense, is <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s first stand _ and without a strong showing, it could be his last. `` We must do well on Super Tuesday _ there's no ifs, ands or buts about it,'' said his campaign manager, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has solid black backing, has taken the lead in some recent Southern surveys. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, both of which have only tiny black populations, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> notched respectable fourth-place showings, indicating he has broadened his base of support. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has singled out <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as his main opponent in the South. `` I think it will essentially become a two-person race,'' he said. He raised the `` electability'' of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Tuesday, saying: `` Democrats in all parts of the country are really hungry for a victory in 1988 and interested in finding a nominee who can offer the best chance of beating the Republicans in the fall.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are displaying vastly differing campaign styles. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is racking up endorsements from key political leaders, and kicked off a massive media campaign last week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does n't have the money for big media buys, but his campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, said that is n't important because <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is already well-known. As for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s support from the Democratic political establishment, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> retorts: `` We're depending on the endorsement of the people, not the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speakers and the like.'' The well-funded <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending heavily in delegate-rich <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and his organization is seen as strong, especially in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. To mount a serious Super Tuesday television offensive, a candidate must buy air time in 20 or more separate television markets. That means big expenses _ a major factor for candidates like Democrats <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who are saddled with debt. Among Republicans, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was kicking off his Southern campaign with a news conference Thursday at the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Capitol. Despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strong Southern organization _ the best among the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates, in the view of some _ <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was banking on winning over a large undecided vote. `` It does n't surprise me when the people with the vice president say they've got an organization that ca n't be matched down here,'' said <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign director for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, he said, `` We have the thrust to break through that invincibility myth. I think we are going to make rapid gains.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, also was confident. `` We're going <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and fight. It looks good there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He was to campaign in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Thursday and in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> through the weekend. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the former television evangelist, has also shown a strong Southern organization, and his church-backed following will be a formidable force in the Bible belt. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also needs to regain momentum after his disappointing showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, so he's looking to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary on the Saturday before Super Tuesday. An expected low turnout, combined with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s constituency of fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> voters, make that state a likely spot for an improved <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> performance heading into Super Tuesday.

<HEAD>Life-Threatening Illness First Thought To Be Just A Pain In The
Neck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> experienced a pain in the neck, he was placed in a brace until it felt better. But last week when the pain came back suddenly, doctors found an aneurysm on the brain that required delicate surgery to save his life. The surgery, performed last Friday, was so successful that doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday transferred the 45-year-old <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Democrat out of intensive care and into a regular hospital room. `` Physicians are pleased with his continued progress and his condition is listed as satisfactory,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> spokesman. A neurosurgeon familiar with the <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> case said many patients with cerebral aneurysms are not as lucky, particularly if there is rapid and serious bleeding. `` It can kill you in 10 minutes,'' said the surgeon, who asked not to be named. `` Most patients survive,'' he added, but for a serious medical condition, aneurysms on the brain are `` big time.'' The doctor said that <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> is in `` the lucky two-thirds'' who live through cerebral aneurysm surgery, and the senator's relatively quick release from intensive care probably means he avoided a long list of problems that can ambush such patients `` One third of these patients die,'' said the surgeon, while others may experience some loss of function, such as paralysis or decline of intellectual ability. `` But if everything is perfect and the surgery is within 24 hours -LRB- of serious bleeding -RRB-, they can be out of the hospital within seven days. Recovery can be absolutely normal.'' Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Laws </PERSON>, chairman of the neurosurgery department at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no details on the <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> case but that patients with successful surgery usually are released within a week or 10 days. `` It sounds like he -LRB- <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> -RRB- is doing better than that, though,'' said Laws. `` I think he's probably going to do great.'' An aneurysm is caused by a weakness in the artery wall that allows pressure to force the artery to swell outward, like a blister. The danger is that the aneurysm will burst. But in the brain, even a mild leakage can be dangerous and damaging. A leakage into the brain from a branch of the carotid artery can cause a neck pain, but both Laws and the other neurosurgeon said it is `` unusual'' for such a pain to be misdiagnosed. Laws suggested that <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, in fact, may have had a neck problem earlier and that development of the aneurysm, which manifests a similar pain, was just coincidental. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> first complained of the neck pain in late January. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, an aide in <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, said when the senator sought medical care, he was issued a brace. `` They thought he had a pinched nerve and a viral infection in the neck at the same time,'' she said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, wore a neck brace in late January during hearings on the nomination of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. A week later, the senator was too ill to vote on the confirmation. But last week, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> felt well enough to take off the brace and accept several speaking engagements at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> colleges, Ms. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the pain returned suddenly and powerfully, and <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> also experienced nausea. He went home to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and immediately was admitted to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> `` for tests.'' One of these tests was a CAT scan, a sophisticated X-ray technique. The aneurysm was spotted and <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> quickly was transferred by ambulance early Friday morning to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> where surgery began only hours later. Laws said that typically in such a procedure an incision is made in the temple area of the head. Surgeons then cut a small window through the wall of the skull and the brain is raised slightly to gain access to the aneurysm site. To correct the flaw, surgeons use a clip, a small metal device with two tiny jaws that lock together. The clip is placed at the base of the aneurysm, parallel to the flow of blood. Left in place permanently, the clip isolates the weak spot and allows the artery to heal. The procedure, said Laws, is `` microsurgery'' because the artery, which he described as like `` a piece of wet spaghetti'' is so small. `` It is very difficult and delicate surgery,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is remaining mum on the battle for the Republican presidential nomination as he heads back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and his regular weekly meeting with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> watched returns from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary on television on Tuesday as he wound up a three-day vacation at his ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> mountains north of here. `` We wo n't have any comment,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said when asked about the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voting. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has maintained a public stance of neutrality in the race for the nomination, although he has repeatedly praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s performance as vice president. In response to a question, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, facing stiff competition from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, had made no requests that the president step up his commendation of the vice president. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had not talked with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent days. The two are scheduled to have lunch at the White House on Thursday, as they do each week. Also on Thursday, the president will meet with bipartisan negotiators in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who worked out the $ 1.1 trillion budget compromise to be formally unveiled that day. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would tell them that `` it is a remarkable budget that ... includes more money for AIDS research, more money for housing and education, but makes cuts in other areas that will allow us to meet the budget reduction and keep the deficit on a downward path.'' Later Thursday, the president will attend the swearing in of Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He nominated <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected his nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and his second nominee, Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, withdrew in the face of reports of his marijuana use in earlier days. On Friday, the president will meet with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> before leaving for Camp David to spend the weekend. At his final meeting with reporters in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked about a speech in which <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, the president's disarmament adviser, told a group of scientists in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is `` squandering time'' in arms talks and `` remains a brutal adversary. `` I think Ambassador <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> was just giving them a little prod that says, ` Come on, fellows, let's get down to business here,''' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We might not use those words, but we share his concerns.'' The spokesman also announced that the president was signing a bill by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, rescinding an $ 8 million appropriation for schools for North African Jews in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> was criticized after including the funds in a catch-all appropriations bill.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said reports of his death had been greatly exaggerated. His comeback may get the same treatment. That's the way it is in the crucial, high-stakes, do-or-die, make-or-break, pick-a-cliche contests that begin the season of competition for presidential nominations. Every state leaves an indelible imprint, until the next state votes. That sometimes means as long as a week. The early omens, circa 1988, point to a season of political trench warfare, in which battle cries and claims to momentum yield to a long, hard struggle to collect delegates, one state at a time, then one vote at a time, until they add up to a nominating majority. One week after he became the Republicans' leading loser, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gained a solid comeback victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential primary Tuesday. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, third among Democrats in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, won easily in next-door <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and said that put him on a winning path that leads South. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> claimed satisfaction in second place, but it was way before midnight when he stopped smiling and started snarling at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the Democratic victor in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, said runner up and 20 percent of the vote was a solid showing _ and it was, to the extent that he out paced fellow Midwesterner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for the second week running. `` This is n't helping,'' the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator said in bow-tied understatement Sen. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> polled 17 percent, three points and a good many dollars short. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said if he could have reversed that narrow edge it would have made `` a tremendous difference in raising money,'' which is in dangerously short supply in his campaign. For all of that, nobody was quitting outright, not even former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who got 5 percent and barely beat <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he'd talk with his supporters and figure out what to do next. So, coming out of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, both political parties have confirmed what they knew going in _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the man to beat in what looks like a two-way Republican contest, with <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> looking from the outside in. The Democrats have yet to pick a face from the crowd. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has what edge there is because he is the most recent winner, but he is heading into difficult territory in the Southern primaries that come up on March 8, Super Tuesday. A victory next Tuesday in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> would provide an undeniable boost. To this point, for all the effort and money they have spent, the contestants have succeeded in eliminating <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> from the Republican running, and pushing Democrat <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> toward the exit. Neither of them had a chance in the first place. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who embarrassed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, slumped to last place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The former television evangelist acknowledged that he'd come up short of his hopes, but said he was n't discouraged `` My natural base is down in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and that's where we go from here,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> ran third, with 13 percent. He said that made him the winner in the competition to become the candidate of the conservative wing of the party. Or, as he later billed it, the progressive conservative wing. He, too, said the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> promised him a better lot. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> ran narrowly ahead of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Democrats <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said they, too, were aiming southward. The black vote there is certain to boost <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s showings. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> decided to wait near his <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> base for the rest of the field to come there. `` Super Tuesday is a completely new ball game,'' he said. But it is a game in which there will be enough conflicting messages to enable most of the contestants to claim headway. All 20 contests are not in the South. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and next door <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> will be holding primaries on March 8, among the half-dozen outside the Southern and border states.

 Student protesters who have held a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> building for five days began deliberating a tentative understanding late Tuesday hammered out earlier in the day by their negotiators and university officials. The students' meeting was closed, and there were conflicting signals on whether an end to the five-day standoff, which began when some 200 minority students took over the school's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in a protest of campus racial tensions, was near an end. `` Not all -LRB- the students' -RRB- demands have been met, but all have been responded to in good faith,'' Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said as he forwarded a written statement to the students. `` There are things I can not do now, but we've agreed to plan to address general concerns.'' Earlier, university officials had said <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> would be putting into writting a tentative understanding reached between him and a nine-member student negotiating committee during a meeting that lasted nearly four hours. `` It looks like we have a resolution,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, after the meeting broke up. But a student spokesman said late in the evening that the document sent by <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was received with `` mixed emotions'' by the entire student group and that discussions of what they would do next could last well into the night. `` The vote is going very slowly,'' spokesman <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. ` I'm getting nervous.'' Earlier, when the meeting with <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was still in progress, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had also expressed optimism on the way it were going, saying he was `` pleased with the results.'' <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, university spokeswoman, described the tentative understanding as `` an agenda for what we'll do, where we will go from here.'' Administrators did not release the document sent to the students, but <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, another student spokesman, said it contained a promise of further efforts to improve minority students' condititions on the campus, including increased support for minority organizations. The day also saw a rally by more than 500 white UMass students who supported the minority students' protest. `` Hey, ho, Chancellor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, racism has got to go'' was chanted by students, who were held back by black students linking arms to clear a path for <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> as he walked toward the building. Students and faculty also read letters of support, including a message sent Tuesday by Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Some supporters had traveled from <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and local businesses and residents had sent protesters blankets, pillows and food. `` I came to see if they needed any help,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, 21, a senior from <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who added that she was missing two classes to attend the vigil. `` I think it's a good cause.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a Democratic presidential contender who was in nearby <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> for Tuesday's primary balloting, called the protesters at 9:15 a.m. to lend his support. `` The students occupying the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have taken a principled position on legitimate concerns. The quality of leadership in the state and country can be determined by how it handles such crises as this one,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a statement read by a protester. The protesters had said they would meet with <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> to negotiate on a revised set of demands, which a spokesman for the group declined to detail. They vowed to remain until <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> agrees to their conditions. The six original demands included a written policy against discrimination by the university, prosecution of five white students accused of attacking two black men and a white woman on Feb. 7, and the suspension of campus police officers who allegedly formed a line-up of black men when women complained of harassment. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON>, a German professor, said 50 faculty members have signed a statement deploring the recent incidents and urging the administration to resolve the dispute. `` A climate of hostility, danger and racial intolerance must not be allowed to continue,'' said the statement, signed by members of an ad hoc committee to promote racial tolerance. The group was formed in response to a fight between black and white students following the World Series in 1986. The university rescheduled classes that usually meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> to other buildings. `` We see this as a short-term, temporary thing. We do n't want to escalate tensions,'' spokesman <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> had said. Between 50 and 200 students remained in the building through the long holiday weekend, according to <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Associate Dean of Students <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Townes </PERSON>, who is serving as mediator, said the protesters were civil but determined. `` There has been a resolve that this was going to be the last time they were going to make a stand,'' <PERSON> Townes </PERSON> said. `` This is not a movement led by radical students. These are good students tired of dealing with this.'' A session between the protesters and <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, planned for Monday, was canceled because <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> left campus to visit an ailing brother. The protesters sent <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> a sympathy card signed by more than 200 students. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> responded by sending them a fruit basket and a card that read: `` I send affection and respect.'' About 9 percent of the 25,000 students at the state's largest public university are minorities. There are 641 blacks enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> and about 500 of them are undergraduates, <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said. Total undergraduate enrollment is approximately 19,000 students.

 The latest appearance of a great white shark and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON>'s film of his own book received the dubious honor Wednesday of being at the top of the pack as the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raspberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> announced its picks for worst pictures of 1987. The 8th Annual Golden Raspberry Award nominations also went to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> and the $ 35 million superflop `` Ishtar'' as the foundation took note of what it felt was truly terrible in motion pictures last year. `` Jaws: The Revenge'' and `` Tough Guys Do n't Dance'' received seven Razzie nominations each, with the acting considered so bad in the latest `` Jaws'' sequel that even <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> the mechanical shark was nominated for worst actor. The Razzies are a light-hearted parody of the Oscar ceremonies and coincide with the annual Academy Award nominations, which will be announced Wednesday. The Razzie ceremony will be held April 10 and will feature dramatic readings of the most ridiculous lyrics from some awful movie songs. The winners, if they dare to show up, will receive a trophy of a golf-ball size raspberry glued atop a film reel and spray-painted with gold. `` There are three basic theories of what qualifies as a Razzie,'' explained <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, Razzie foundation president. `` First, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s own measure, how much money did it lose? Second, a movie that was not supposed to be a comedy that generated enormous laughs from the audience. ` Jaws' was one of those and so was <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON>'s ` Tough Guys Do n't Dance,' which was laughed off the screen in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>. `` The last is how excruciating it is to actually sit through a film. Does someone have to pay you money or bribe you with popcorn? ` Who's That Girl?' fits into that category,'' he said. Cosby received three nominations for star, author and producer of `` Leonard: Part 6,'' a movie that he disavowed and almost no one saw. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, last year's Worst Actress winner, is a contender this year for `` Who's That Girl?,'' nominated for five Razzies. <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, the all-time Razzie champ with four wins, is continuing the tradition with `` the maudlin arm-wrestling melodrama'' `` Over the Top,'' which got three nominations. The Golden Raspberry Foundation, made up of film professionals and critics as well as frequent film-goers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and nine other states, believe the worst pictures of 1987 were `` Ishtar,'' `` Jaws: The Revenge,'' `` Leonard: Part 6,'' `` Tough Guys Do n't Dance'' and `` Who's That Girl? Named for worst performances by an actor, besides <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> the Shark, were Cosby in `` Leonard: Part 6''; <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> in `` From the Hip''; <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> in `` Tough Guys Do n't Dance''; and <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> in `` Over the Top.'' Worst actress nominations, in addition to <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, went to <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> in `` Ratboy''; <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> in `` Jaws''; <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandlund </PERSON> in `` Tough Guys Do n't Dance''; and <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> in `` <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quatermain </PERSON> and the Lost City of Gold.'' Worst supporting actor nominees are <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barty </PERSON> in `` Masters of the Universe''; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcroft </PERSON>, all of `` Million Dollar Mystery''; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> in `` Jaws: The Revenge''; and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendenhall </PERSON> in `` Over the Top.'' Nominated for worst supporting actress are <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, `` Leonard: Part 6''; <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, `` Wall Street''; <PERSON> Mariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, `` Superman IV''; <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, `` Siesta''; and <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON>, for both `` Siesta'' and `` Tough Guys Do n't Dance.'' Worst director nominees were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> for `` Who's That Girl?''; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> for `` Tough Guys Do n't Dance''; <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> for `` Ishtar''; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> for `` Jaws: The Revenge''; and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiland </PERSON> for `` Leonard: Part 6.''

<HEAD>Department Wants To Share Cost For Recreational Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is looking for state and local business partners to help share the cost of upgrading recreational facilities on national forest lands. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the move is in response to increasing demands for more recreational areas and service, and to help relieve pressures on federal spending. `` The squeezed budget is a factor,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told a news conference. A spokesman for an environmental group, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, supported the agency's program but with some reservation. `` There definitely needs to be greater emphasis on recreation, and I would applaud efforts on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to increase the emphasis on recreation,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, a society economist. `` I would urge them to use caution in opening the door to private development, however.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the `` Challenge Cost-Share Program'' was authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a pilot basis at a level of $ 500,000 for the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1. Of that, $ 100,000 was earmarked for the <ORGANIZATION> Tonto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, with the remainder available to other regions to supplement money put up by local people, companies, state agencies, municipalities or other groups. Some 31 recreation projects have been approved and will be under way this spring and summer he said. Restoration and improvement of existing facilities, areas and trails are typical goals. The $ 500,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> seed money was met with $ 908,000 from various partners involved in the 31 pilot projects. One of the objectives of the program will be to provide more facilities on national forest land near cities. Private investors will be encouraged to develop new campgrounds, marinas, ski areas. No increase in user fees is being proposed at this time, but that eventually will have to be faced, he said. Asked if the plan means opening the door for major private development on national forest land, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> replied: `` Yes, we are opening that door, but we also need to work with those private sector proposals to see if they fit into the overall scheme'' for recreation development. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> administers 191 million acres, or about 8 -LCB- percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total land area. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the proposed budget that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for the 1989 fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1 will include $ 3 million for the recreation cost-share program, up from the $ 500,000 in pilot funds this year. One that began in 1986 for fish and wildlife will be requested at $ 5 million, compared with $ 1.5 million in fiscal 1988.

 Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of Feb. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.86 million head, up 8 percent from a year ago and 3 percent from two years ago, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. Marketings of `` fed'' cattle in January totaled 1.76 million head, down 2 percent from a year ago but 1 percent above two years ago, the report said Tuesday. The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last month was reported at 1.66 million head, up 4 percent from a year ago and 5 percent more than in January 1986. The report said those were the largest January feedlot placements since 1974. As of Feb. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year earlier in six states and down in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The states account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef production. State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Feb. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>Justice Finds No Conflict In Ginsburg's 16 Cable Matters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former antitrust chief <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> dealt with 16 different cable industry matters while holding cable stock but either his role or his chance for personal gain was too small to violate federal conflict-of-interest laws, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The department's decision not to request appointment of an independent counsel for further investigation of the former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee was detailed in a 116-page report released Tuesday. The report by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, head of the department's criminal division, summarized the results of a three-month inquiry in which Justice and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials interviewed more than 50 people, including <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> did not return telephone calls seeking his reaction, but his lawyers had joined the department in asking that the report be released to the public. The report was released by the division of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here that appoints independent counsels to investigate alleged wrongdoing by high federal officials. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Government Ethics says it wants to read the report before deciding whether to do or say anything about the case, according to its general counsel, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. Separate from the criminal sanctions, a presidential executive order prohibits actions that might give an appearance of conflict. The penalty for violating this is administrative discipline. But <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> has since become a member of the judicial branch, sitting on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here. All the ethics office or any other executive branch agency could do now is issue a letter or reprimand for a former employee. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said the department conducted a preliminary inquiry into three matters that had been reported in news accounts. In addition, department investigators came up with 13 other instances of <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s involvement in cable issues, but <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said these did not even merit a preliminary inquiry. <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> withdrew from consideration as a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice last November after he acknowledged that he had smoked marijuana while a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation covered a period from 1983 to 1986 in which he was either assistant attorney general in charge of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division or a deputy to the chief During this period, his only substantial stock holding was about $ 140,000 worth of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian-based cable operator which is also among the top 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cable operators. The news reports about the cable dealings triggered the Justice inquiry that began last November and was concluded with the Feb. 6 report released Tuesday. The marijuana use was not a subject in the inquiry because no federal laws were violated. In one of the newly disclosed instances, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s stock in <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> might have risen in value as a result of <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s participation in a copyright infringement case before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s participation, including ordering a brief opposing <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review of the case and editing an early draft, was substantial as required by the conflict-of-interest laws. And <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said that case might have relieved <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of paying some fees for transmitting copyright programs over its cable systems. `` Judge <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, through his ownership of class B shares of <ORGANIZATION> RCI </ORGANIZATION>, may have had an interest in <ORGANIZATION> RCI </ORGANIZATION>'s no longer paying the transmission fee,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> wrote. But <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> added that `` any such interest would be remote, direct and infinitesimal.'' In addition, he said, <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> did not appear to be aware of his financial interest. In one case in which the department did conduct a preliminary inquiry, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> participated personally and substantially in a friend-of-the-court brief to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In that case, the high court for the first time extended First Amendment protection to cable operators. But <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said officials questioned by the department differed on whether and how much <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> would be helped or hurt by this ruling. In two previously reported matters involving comments filed by the antitrust division with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s role was `` tangential and unimportant'' in one case and `` insubstantial'' in the other. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> handled the matter as acting attorney general because Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and four other more senior <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials decided to take no part in the case.

<HEAD>Grain Pledge Surprises US Officials</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unsually large Soviet pledge of 250,000 tons of grain to famine-plagued <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> has generated surprise among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials but concern over who will pay for delivery. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> has officially welcomed the Soviet commitment, pointing out that it has encouraged all potential donors to make a contribution to easing <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s plight As one of the world's largest grain importers, it is somewhat unusual for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to play the role of food donor. But <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is a close <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ally and has benefited for years from Western food conributions. According to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is expected to purchase about 32 million tons of grain during the year ending next June 30. But Soviet grain harvests have been comparatively good during 1986-87, surpassing 200 million tons in consecutive years for the first time. The Soviet pledge was made three weeks ago, generating surprise here because the largest previous donation by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> was 10,000 metric tons of rice during the 1984-85 famine. The latest food shortage is primarily the result of a severe drought last summer. The 250,000-ton pledge exceeds the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment by about 3,000 tons. An A.I.D. statement said the combined contribution of Western nations exceeds half a million tons. The major unanswered question <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are asking is who will pick up the cost of distributing the Soviet deliveries. A.I.D. said it would have no objection if private voluntary organizations working in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> help in distribution of the Soviet grains, but no request has been made thus far. `` We naturally assume that the Soviets will fund the cost of distribution as A.I.D. has done for food provided by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' the agency said, estimating at $ 25 million the cost of delivering the Soviet shipments. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said that the Soviets have provided transport aircraft to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> for food distribution in the past, as well as trucks and Soviet drivers.

<HEAD>Sales Of Existing Homes Held Steady Last Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Home prices skyrocketed in many Northeastern cities last year, propelled by that region's prosperous economy, while prices were falling in depressed farm and energy regions, according to a survey by a real estate trade group. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that prices on existing homes rose 5.1 percent to a national average of $ 84,300 at the close of last year, slightly ahead of consumer inflation, which was up 4.4 percent in 1987. But the nationwide average masked widespread geographic differences. Home prices shot up 32.2 percent in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, six times the national average. Three other Eastern cities, <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also saw home prices climb by 18 percent or more. But the association said its survey of 53 metropolitan areas found 14 cities where prices fell during the year. This list was dominated by areas dependent on farming and energy industries. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> suffered the biggest price decline, a drop of 7.2 percent, followed by declines of 5.6 percent in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 5.5 percent in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> was ranked as the most affordable place to buy a home last year with a median price of $ 52,000. At the top of the price scale were <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, with a mid-point price of $ 180,800, and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, with a selling price of $ 178,600 at the end of last year. These two cities have held the top two price positions for the past two years. Despite volatile mortgage rates and the October collapse of the stock market, home sales remained near eight-year highs last year. Sales totaled 3.885 million units in 1987, down a tiny 0.3 percent from 1986. Both years represented the fastest sales pace since 4.05 million homes were sold in 1979. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, two states which had suffered a big slump in sales because of depressed energy industries, enjoyed a rebound last year, leading the country along with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with the largest percentage gains. Sales in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> rose 26.2 percent and were up 18.8 percent in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Twenty-two states had sales increases last year. Others enjoying big gains were <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, with an 18.5 percent increase and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, with advances of 17.9 percent and 14.3 percent respectively. `` The <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> continues as the strongest region but we saw considerable strength in the South and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, two areas which had been lagging the rest of the country,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the realtors group. Twenty-two states suffered sales declines last year, led by a 13.8 percent drop in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, a decline which erased a 15.5 percent gain of the previous year. Sales fell 13.3 percent in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, followed by declines of 9.7 percent in both <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Analysts said that one factor which pushed up 1986 sales was a last-minute rush to close sales and reap capital gains profits before the new tax law took effect on Jan. 1, 1987. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted that price increases nationwide should be lower than the 5.1 percent rise in 1987 with sales expected to decline by around 8 percent, in part because of slower economic growth. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted that the Northeast will continue to have the highest home prices of any region, but he said the rate of increase should slow. `` A leveling off is occurring after a long period of overheated activity,'' he said. `` The losses incurred by those in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financial community are still having a lagging effect on home buying in that area.''

 The new U.S.-Soviet nuclear missile pact is seriously flawed but its defeat in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be a politically unacceptable blow to the unity of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, two national security experts say. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Perle </PERSON>, who recently stepped down as assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for international security affairs, is trying to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to change the medium-range missile treaty. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that the pact should permit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to deploy medium-range, ground-launched cruise missiles armed with non-nuclear explosives. But <PERSON> Perle </PERSON> said that if it became clear such an amendment would have the effect of killing the treaty, `` I would not favor it.'' Retired Army Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, until recently the supreme allied commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, told the committee that he believes the treaty overall will have an adverse impact on the military situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Pershing missiles, which are to be destroyed under the treaty, are the one weapon that can strike with assurance deep into Soviet territory from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is faced with a no-win situation because it would be almost impossible politically for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to keep its medium-range nuclear missile force in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, even if the treaty were defeated. `` I would say that failure to ratify might well have a major negative impact on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the future viability of the alliance,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. He said the alliance must now insist on modernizing its force of short-range nuclear weapons remaining in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a hedge against Soviet aggression. Both <PERSON> Perle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> questioned whether Soviet compliance with the new treaty could be adequately verified. But in closed-door hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a different sort of worry surfaced about the treaty's verifications provisions The concern centered on the on-site inspection provisions of the treaty, which apply to both sides and permit teams of Soviet officials access to certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile facilities. `` I think on-site inspection presents problems,'' said one committee source. `` One of the things we're trying to figure out is how to keep tabs on the Soviets who are coming here. `` It's for sure they're going to be interested in a lot more than looking at <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>,'' the source said, speaking on condition he not be identified by name. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has responsibility for counter-intelligence, but <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials have balked at taking on the job of watching the Soviet inspectors, said committee sources. Instead, they reported, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials have suggested that the Army should be given the task. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, reporting on a week-long trip by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said he found a European consensus for modernizing short-range nuclear weapons, but no agreement on which weapons to build Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said European leaders told the senators `` that the INF treaty should be approved without amendments and that following that, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should proceed with modernizing those ground-based nuclear weapons that are eligible under the treaty

<HEAD>Detroit Newspapers JOA Application Goes to Meese for Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will decide `` as promptly as he can'' whether two <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspapers should be allowed to merge their business and production operations. On Tuesday, the last day for filing briefs before the case went to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said denial of the joint operating agreement application would result in the closure of the 156-year-old Free Press and the loss of 2,200 newspaper jobs. Under a joint operating agreement, the newspapers would split profits and combine their advertising, circulation and production departments, but would retain separate news and editorial departments. The newspapers said a joint operating agreement would result in the elimination of 600 to 1,000 jobs. The application was filed under the Newspaper Preservation Act, designed to prop up newspapers in danger of financial failure as a means of preserving competing editorial voices in cities. The issue is decided in a quasi-judicial process, with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division presenting arguments against the proposed agreement and the newspapers arguing for it. The attorney general acts as an impartial judge in making the final ruling on the application. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` will act as promptly as he can,'' but that he probably will want his staff to review and analyze the case first. The News is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The two papers have long been locked in a battle for newspaper dominance in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The News, which is the larger newspaper, has lost $ 75 million since 1979, and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has lost $ 100 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>. Final briefs by the newspapers and the antitrust division included discussion of the weight <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should give to a decision in January by directors of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> to close the Free Press if a JOA is disapproved. The antitrust division contends that when the newspapers announced their application for the joint operating agreement in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> was willing to continue subsidizing the Free Press. `` Whether a newspaper is failing within the meaning of the -LRB- Newspaper Preservation Act -RRB- should properly be determined as of the time it enters into a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> agreement, not on the basis of decisions made in the face of subsequent failure to win approval under the statute,'' the division said. The newspapers countered that the board's announcement made it clear that `` the choice now is between a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> and the certain closure of the Free Press.'' Local 22 of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, which represents editorial employees, voted 349-84 Monday night to continue opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>. But a brief filed by the newspapers included statements by five other unions representing News and Free Press employees, withdrawing opposition to the proposed agreement. Those unions said `` the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> is the only way to assure the survival of the Free Press and the preservation of two independent editorial voices in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>March 31 Deadline Firm on Beef and Citrus, US Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials have reiterated to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that they will not extend a four-year agricultural quota agreement beyond its March 31 expiration date. The agreement includes Japanese quotas on imports of American beef and citrus fruit, restrictions to which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials now object. Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Hidero </PERSON> <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> was informed of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position during a visit here last week, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative's office. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to extend the four-year quota agreement carried the implied threat of taking Japanese import barriers against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citrus and beef before the international panel that resolves disputes under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has said that possibility would be considered. The expiring quotas cover fresh beef and fruit. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier asked for a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> ruling on Japanese restrictions on the import of 12 categories of processed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foodstuffs. Officials said during the visit of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> last month that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would abide by <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> findings. Imports of foreign agricultural products are a sensitive political issue in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of resistance from strong rural factions of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal-Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is already the best customer for American farm products, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials maintain that the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and high consumer prices for home-grown foodstuffs justify a freer Japanese market for imports.

 <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>, an economist and author whose work influenced much of the economic thinking of the New Deal, has died at the age of 91. Means died Monday of complications from a stroke suffered six months ago. Widely regarded as the father of the theory of administered prices, Means was the author with <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> of `` The <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> and Private Property,'' a study of the behavior of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations.

He held a variety of posts before leaving the government in 1943. Since 1958 he had been an independent economics consultant, analyst and author specializing in the study of how the corporate economy functions. He first published his theories on administered prices during the 1930s, and they gained wide circulation in the 1950s and 1960s. According to the theory, certain corporate giants in industries such as oil, steel and automobile manufacturing and some labor unions have wide discretion over prices they set on their products and their members' labor. They are able to set and hold _ or `` administer'' _ prices without regard to fluctuations in demand. He observed that profit levels were maintained simply by decreasing production and thereby reducing costs when demand fell.

<HEAD>GOP Turnout High At Precinct Meetings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> showed his strength in statewide precinct meetings that drew a record turnout, Republican officials said. The precinct meetings are the first step in the process leading up to the Republican national convention in August. Those participating in the meetings will choose the delegates to go to county conventions and discuss what should be in the state's platform Although the delegates eventually chosen to go to the national convention will be bound by the result of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary March 8, the campaigns want good showings for their candidates at the precinct meetings. `` <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had a good night around the state,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` In rural areas, in the south and east, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> clearly was the winner. `` He probably got 60 to 70 percent. That's not large numbers but it's more than we have had in previous years.'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Tuesday night that party officials did n't know exactly how many people attended the meetings, but the figure could be as high as 28,000, compared with between 12,000 and 13,000 last time. One Republican official said Monday that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters had been told to `` flood the precinct meetings.'' `` We want as many delegates as possible at the convention,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who is working for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We've been burned in conventions before. We always have trouble when we hit the convention floor with the party establishment.'' Those attending the precinct meetings selected delegates to the county conventions, where delegates to the district and state conventions are chosen. Each district will elect three delegates and three alternates to the national convention. The state convention will pick 18 delegates-at-large and 18 alternates to the national convention. Republican county conventions are scheduled for March 5, with congressional district meetings March 26 and the party's state convention April 16. The national convention is Aug. 15-18.

 A woman seeking psychiatric help in a hospital emergency room suddenly shot a social worker to death with a handgun and held three people hostage before surrendering Tuesday night, police said. <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 31, of suburban <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> was arrested on homicide and related charges in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the city's <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> neighborhood at about 10:15 p.m., according to police Cmdr <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> apparently was sitting with hospital caseworker <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in the psychiatric waiting area of the emergency room at about 8:55 p.m. when she shot Miss <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> without warning, according to police and to hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON>. `` The social worker was talking to this woman and ... there did n't seem to be any conflict, and a security guard turned around and heard four gunshots,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON> said. `` They were sitting, I assume, side by side.'' After the shooting, Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> took two women and a man hostage and held them for more than an hour before they were released unharmed, police said. The hostages, who were not identified, were waiting at the emergency room for a relative who was being treated, police said. `` Everyone else in the emergency room was evacuated. The people who were being seen in treatment rooms were taken out,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> came to the hospital by herself seeking psychiatric care. Police Chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said four to six shots were fired. After that, he said, Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> went into a restroom and pointed a handgun through a slightly opened door at the people seated nearby, ordering them not to move. Police entered the emergency room and began talking to Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in the bathroom, who allowed them to remove the wounded caseworker, <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> died before getting medical treatment, he said. <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> first let one of the three hostages go free, then asked to talk to <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a popular local television talk show host. When <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> arrived, the woman freed the other two hostages, police said. Officers then managed to distract her enough to be able to close the restroom door on her, and eventually persuaded her to surrender. Police said the woman was being questioned by homicide detectives during the night. No time had been set for an arraignment and bail hearing.

<TEXT>
 Late-deciding Republican voters confounded the polls and boosted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to his convincing victory over Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential primary, analysts say. Voters who made their choice in the race's final days went strongly for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in part because of his superior campaign organization, his ties to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and his experience in office, exit polls indicated Tuesday. The result was a 9-point victory for the vice president, after some polls had shown him leading <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> just barely, by 4 points in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll and 2 points in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey. `` The voters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> have a well-deserved reputation of upsetting poll results, and tonight was a good example of that,'' said NBC News pollster <PERSON> Laurily </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>. `` People change their minds, and you ca n't poll for that.'' An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> exit poll found that 14 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> made up their minds on primary day, with 36 percent going for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 29 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Another 11 percent decided during the weekend, breaking 44 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 31 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` It was the undecideds. The undecideds went for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>, a poll analyst for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. A key reason: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s identification with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is very popular among New Hampshire Republicans `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coattails were there,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll consultant. `` People who like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were going strongly for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s exit poll supported that contention. Three-quarters of Republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>; 88 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s supporters held that view, compared with 66 percent of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s. There were fewer <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> backers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and more of them went for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> than for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, albeit narrowly, in the precinct caucuses Feb. 8. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won big there while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suffered a third-place embarrassment. <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s economic vitality could explain <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity in that state, and its benefit for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here, a belief that there may be a threat if I do n't go with someone who's following the same line,'' he said Perhaps for similar reasons, a third of Republicans said experience was the chief factor in their vote, and 54 percent of them voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to 37 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the CBS-Times poll said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won among Republicans looking chiefly for a strong leader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but that group made up just 19 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> total. Another key for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was his extensive campaign organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The CBS-Times poll found that 47 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his organization, while just 26 percent of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s supporters reported contact by the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign `` I think the thing that won it for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was his organization,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>, polling chief at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. While the polls did not anticipate the extent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory, <ORGANIZATION> Mitofsky </ORGANIZATION> said they did identify trends in the race: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> way ahead before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, dropping sharply after losing to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, then halting his slide and rebounding during the weekend. Speaking on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> credited his victory to a surge of support in the last 48 hours. `` I learned from that, fight back. Fight on,'' he said. `` It's taught me a good lesson: Do not be discouraged by the polling numbers.'' The exit poll results were less remarkable on the Democratic side, where <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won handily, as expected. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had him winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in organization. The poll results also indicated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backyard advantage. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said 55 percent of Democrats rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> above average as governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and 59 percent of them voted for him. Moreover, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found that 20 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Democratic voters moved there from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and four in 10 of them went for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s second-place finish appeared to be aided by his first-place showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Of the voters who made up their minds after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 27 percent went to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, 26 percent to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 20 percent to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who finished second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the formal, patrician Republican whose presidential bid had been thrown into sudden peril with a trouncing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, stood in the lot at <PERSON> Cuzzin </PERSON> <PERSON> Richie </PERSON>'s truckstop `` This is the real me,'' he insisted, climbing into the cab of an 18-wheeler. `` This is my home turf.'' It was three days after the vice president had been crushed in an embarrassing third-place finish in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, riding the wave out of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, was surging here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. But then came the new <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his new campaign. With a U-turn in style and approach, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came back and blunted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s surge with a big victory in Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s formidable organization swung into high gear. The vice president's association with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which had hurt him in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, proved a big plus here _ one that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> milked for all it was worth. And an eleventh-hour advertising campaign, attacking <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and touting the support of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, helped bring him back from the edge of the abyss. The vice president went from a 20-point edge over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> before <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to as much as 8 points behind. But the tracking polls said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> peaked about Friday, the day the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign hit the airwaves with a new ad accusing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of `` straddling'' major issues. In nearly final returns Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a 9-point margin over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: 38-29. On the night of his big defeat in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed stunned. Asked if his big entourage, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection and arms-length style were getting in the way of reaching the people, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> answered that he was n't sure. Still shaky the next day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> started before dawn to greet workers at a factory gate. But few workers used that entrance and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent a good portion of the time talking to reporters. Then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried out a new slogan: `` I'm one of you.'' Born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and with a home in neighboring <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealed to Granite State voters as his neighbors. But he drifted away from the slogan, which was too close to the `` He's one of us'' theme <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had used in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Then, 36 hours after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters saw the new <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Canceling a swing through the South, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew back in from his weekly lunch in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and went to the giant <ORGANIZATION> Pheasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> to shake hands late Wednesday. Munching a chocolate-chip cookie, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shook hands with dozens of voters and heard some of them say he had their vote. `` That's good to hear,'' he told one supporter. `` It's a good morale booster.'' With that, gone were the formal events, the speeches, the `` town meetings'' with the carefully orchestrated crowds. Now it was the informal <PERSON> George </PERSON> and `` impromptu campaign stops.'' The first came at the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumberyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, N.H. There, in a casual coat and a cap, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shook hands with customers and staff and drove a giant forklift around the yard. It was all for the benefit of the media, so the voters could see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mixing with people and doing everyday tasks. Then it was onto <PERSON> Cuzzin </PERSON> <PERSON> Richie </PERSON>'s, near <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> on the seacoast. He talked to truckers and drove a semi-rig around the block _ with a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> man hanging off the mirror and the armored limousine right behind. To go with the new freewheeling style were tough new ads hitting at <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. One labeled <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as a man who had straddled the issues of taxes, the INF treaty and an oil import fee. Another _ a five-minute election-eve buy _ featured <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, known as Mr. Conservative, backing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Still another hit at <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for backing a national economic commission. That `` exists to provide political cover for a tax hike. If it does n't recommend a tax increase, I'll not only eat my hat, I'll eat <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s hat,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the ad <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to campaign in malls and stores and nursing homes, reaching out to people directly, in the retail campaigning style that the state once insisted upon. He brought baseball great <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to the state to add a celebrity touch to the final days. All the while, his well-respected organization was cranking away at high speed, focused on getting its 40,000 potential supporters to the polls. The final piece of the puzzle was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself. A private man in a public job, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was forced to begin talking about himself _ not as a public official, but as a person. `` Mostly these days, I think of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> _ ` Here I stand, warts and all,'' he told a group of senior citizens in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>. `` I have a tendency _ and I will confess to it _ to avoid going on and on with great eloquent statements of belief. There may be better orators out there, but nobody believes more strongly. ... Maybe in some ways, I'm a little more taciturn than I could be,'' he said. `` I care too much to quit now. ... So can you help me?'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> heard and heeded that plea.

 A former employee of a <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> defense contractor fatally shot seven people and wounded five others at the company's offices Tuesday, including a woman who had spurned him, authorities said. The man, identified by police as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, 39, surrendered after barricading himself inside the building for about six hours. Three officers grabbed him as he walked out with his hands in the air and he was taken to the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. Employees dove under desks and inside closets as the gunman shot his way into the two-story <ORGANIZATION> ESL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buiding, witnesses said. As the siege continued into the evening, police negotiators talked by telephone with the man, who at times was tearful and `` expressed a little remorse'' for his actions, said Lt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sunnyvale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Two women and five men were killed, said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON>, commander of the safety department. They were not immediately identified. The gunman, who was fired from the company three years ago, had called police and said he shot three people on the first floor `` and as many on the second floor,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of the safety department. He was armed with a rifle, shotgun and two handguns, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. One woman was listed in critical condition; two others were in good condition. The condition of two other victims was not immediately available. The gunman said he entered the building planning to destroy equipment but began shooting employees because `` he felt threatened by them,'' according to Lt. <PERSON> Rueben </PERSON> <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON>, the chief police negotiator. On the second floor, he saw <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, the woman who had rejected his advances, <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON> said. She slammed an office door in his face and he shot her through the door, wounding her in the shoulder. At least three people had been reported holed up in a computer room and making telephone calls to police, while others were able to escape. The shooting began about 2:30 p.m. at the subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. `` I saw a man walk up and I did n't really pay attention and then just shortly later I heard bang, large bangs, and I realized it must be shots,'' said witness <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, who hid in her office. `` I was in the office by myself and I closed the door and it locked and I got underneath my desk and I must have heard about 50 different shots over a period of time. I must have been in there maybe 20 minutes, something like that.'' Nearby, police found a motor home they believe was driven by the gunman. Inside, officers found a quantity of ammunition, full cans of gasoline and other explosive material, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. Black had been a target of <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s affections for about four years, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who worked at ESL as a computer software technician, reportedly followed <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and <PERSON> Black </PERSON> had tried to obtain a restraining order to keep him away, he said. The two were never believed to have dated, he said. `` It was described to me a situation that had turned into harassment. He had, according to him, had given her a warning and she did n't heed the warning and he said this was his way of making a point,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. ESL, or Electro-magnetic Science Lab, was established in 1964 and specializes in electronic warfare systems for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, most of them highly classified. Products include recognizance systems, data-communications systems, computer simulation and image processing.

<HEAD>Pentagon Confirms That Some Warships Being Withdrawn From Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says withdrawal of some warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> represents a `` fine-tuning'' of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence, but it also is voicing concern over the conduct of Iraqi forces in the region. There are currently 28 ships in the region, but the helicopter carrier <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and two escorts are coming home without being replaced, assistant secretary of defense <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Our mission of protecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag ships in the gulf remains unchanged,'' <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> said. `` We do n't think the -LRB- overall -RRB- threat has abated. However, we think we've learned a lot of lessons in the mine-sweeping area and this allows us primarily to pull out -LRB- some of the ships -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> said the Pentagon no longer thinks it needs mine-sweeping helicopters along with mine-sweeping ships, clearing the way for the <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'s departure. <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON>, in charge of international security affairs, also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already had protested to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> an incident Saturday in which an Iraqi jet fired a missile near a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyer. He said the administration planned to send a team of military officials to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> later this week to discuss the matter further. <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> also said that the administration had no plans to offer military protection to U.S.-owned ships flying foreign flags. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` This represents a fine-tuning of our position in the Gulf and not a policy change that would be reflected in overall forces or in other countries' actions.'' The remarks by <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> were the first reflecting official administration concern about <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military operations near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> thought it had won Iraqi agreement after the deadly attack on the USS Stark last May to keep jet fighters roughly 40 miles away from American warships. In Saturday's incident, an Iraqi jet failed to respond to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> radio calls and fired a missile that passed close to the destroyer Chandler during a convoy operation. <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> announced other moves that had been previously outlined Jan. 26: _ The aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> has just replaced the carrier Midway in the northern <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, making it easier to order the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> home The Enterprise is a much larger, nuclear-powered carrier with a larger air wing than that aboard the Midway. _ The command ship of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION>, the LaSalle, will soon be replaced in a routine rotation by the Coronado _ The amphibious landing ship <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> is being replaced by the amphibious landing ship <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, which will be carrying Marine Cobra attack copters

<TEXT>
 Late-deciding Republican voters confounded the polls and boosted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to his convincing victory over Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential primary, analysts say. Voters who made their choice in the race's final days went strongly for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in part because of his superior campaign organization, his ties to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and his experience in office, exit polls indicated Tuesday. The result was a 9-point victory for the vice president, after some polls had shown him leading <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> just barely, by 4 points in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll and 2 points in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey. `` The voters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> have a well-deserved reputation of upsetting poll results, and tonight was a good example of that,'' said NBC News pollster <PERSON> Laurily </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>. `` People change their minds, and you ca n't poll for that.'' An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> exit poll found that 14 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> made up their minds on primary day, with 36 percent going for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 29 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Another 11 percent decided during the weekend, breaking 44 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 31 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` It was the undecideds. The undecideds went for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>, a poll analyst for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. A key reason: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s identification with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is very popular among New Hampshire Republicans `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coattails were there,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll consultant. `` People who like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were going strongly for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s exit poll supported that contention. Three-quarters of Republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>; 88 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s supporters held that view, compared with 66 percent of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s. There were fewer <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> backers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and more of them went for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> than for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, albeit narrowly, in the precinct caucuses Feb. 8. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won big there while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suffered a third-place embarrassment. <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s economic vitality could explain <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity in that state, and its benefit for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here, a belief that there may be a threat if I do n't go with someone who's following the same line,'' he said Perhaps for similar reasons, a third of Republicans said experience was the chief factor in their vote, and 54 percent of them voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to 37 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the CBS-Times poll said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won among Republicans looking chiefly for a strong leader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but that group made up just 19 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> total. Another key for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was his extensive campaign organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The CBS-Times poll found that 47 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his organization, while just 26 percent of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s supporters reported contact by the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign `` I think the thing that won it for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was his organization,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>, polling chief at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. While the polls did not anticipate the extent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory, <ORGANIZATION> Mitofsky </ORGANIZATION> said they did identify trends in the race: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> way ahead before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, dropping sharply after losing to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, then halting his slide and rebounding during the weekend. Speaking on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> credited his victory to a surge of support in the last 48 hours. `` I learned from that, fight back. Fight on,'' he said. `` It's taught me a good lesson: Do not be discouraged by the polling numbers.'' The exit poll results were less remarkable on the Democratic side, where <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won handily, as expected. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had him winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in organization. The poll results also indicated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backyard advantage. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said 55 percent of Democrats rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> above average as governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and 59 percent of them voted for him. Moreover, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found that 20 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Democratic voters moved there from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and four in 10 of them went for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s second-place finish appeared to be aided by his first-place showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Of the voters who made up their minds after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 27 percent went to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, 26 percent to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 20 percent to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who finished second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Hampshire Primary Wins Provide Psychological Boost, But Few

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> today with a slight bump in their delegate totals that keeps them both on top in the race for their parties' presidential nominations. But the lift from the early primaries and caucuses is more psychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1,139 delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination or the 2,082 delegates for the Democratic nomination. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who picked up 38 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vote in Tuesday's primary, gained 11 of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s 23 delegates to the GOP National Convention. In all, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now has 61 delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who got 36 percent of the Democratic vote in the primary, won 9 of the state's 18 pledged delegates to that national convention. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has 44.5 delegates. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> gained 7 delegates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to bring his national total to 42, while Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> won 3 delegates to raise his total to 35. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, the winner of last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses, gained 6 national convention delegates for his second-place showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> followed with 3 delegates In the popular vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won 20 percent while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 17 percent. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> now has 39 delegates, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has 33. Under Democratic Party rules, the national convention delegates were awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15 percent of the vote. In effect, that disqualified <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> from receiving any delegates from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 8 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 7 percent, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> 5 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> 4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> have a similar rule, but the threshold is 10 percent. That meant former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who had 10.1 percent, picked up 2 delegates, but former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who was within 1,100 votes of du Pont, received no delegates because he had just 9.5 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> already had 8 delegates, while du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> had none before Tuesday's primary. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> already had 10.55 delegates, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 9.8 and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> had 4. The delegate totals for the Republicans include results from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> both have held <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses, precise delegate figures can not be calculated until later because of the way the selection process is structured. The Democratic totals include results from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, as well as an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members who will serve automatically as delegates to their party's convention. Some of the Democratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention.

 <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Castro </ORGANIZATION> militant <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> returned here confident he will have freedom after his third acquittal in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> on charges he planned the 1976 explosion of a Cuban jetliner that killed 73 people, his lawyer said. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> immediately was taken into custody by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals upon his arrival Tuesday from <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. He faces charges of violating parole on his 1972 conviction in a bazooka attack on a Polish ship here. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, 61, made a brief appearance before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Linnea </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who scheduled a preliminary parole hearing for today. No decision was expected. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Adorno </PERSON>, said his client should be released because he voluntarily returned to face the charges. <PERSON> Adorno </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> fled the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1974 only because his life was in danger. `` He served 11 or 11 -LCB- years in a Venezuelan prison for a crime he did n't commit,'' <PERSON> Adorno </PERSON> said. `` He should be allowed to live as a productive member of the Cuban-American community.'' But <PERSON> Adorno </PERSON> said legal technicalities made a quick release for <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> unlikely. `` He knew when he came here what he was getting into,'' said <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON>. `` We are confident when it is all over he will be free.'' The news of <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s arrival took <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s closely knit Cuban community by surprise, but initial reactions were positive. `` At last the man is free,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Canosa </PERSON>, head of the influential <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, adding that the community's reaction `` is one of rejoicing.'' He said he recently received a letter from <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> indicating an embracing of the foundation's more peaceful approach to democratizing <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> was found innocent in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> of the bombing charges for a third time Aug. 7 and was held in a secret location by Venezuelan police for security reasons while awaiting an appeal by the prosecution. But no appeal was filed within a 90-day limit and the acquittal held. After <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, he was charged with planning the Cuban airliner explosion. Most of those killed in the blast were Cuban athletes who had competed in a Central American and Caribbean Games competition in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Venezuelans <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON> were sentenced to 20 years for the bombing. A fourth defendant, Cuban-born <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Posada </PERSON> <PERSON> Carriles </PERSON>, escaped from jail in 1986 and reportedly was fighting with the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> contended he was framed by pro-Castro forces for the 1968 attack on the Polish freighter, which was engaged in trade with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The ship was dented and there were no injuries, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> formally apologized to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> cracked down on militant anti-Castro groups.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar continued its decline against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today after hitting a two-month closing high Monday, while stocks rose for the fifth consecutive day. The dollar closed at 130.11 yen, down 0.09 yen from Tuesday's close of 130.50 yen, after starting the day at 130.30 yen The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, which hit a two-month closing high of 131.00 Monday, ranged from 130.25 yen to 130.48 yen in dealings today. Most dealers, up to 90 percent, are waiting for a new trend to develop following the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures last Friday, said a foreign exchange dealer at a major Japanese commercial bank. `` No one really believes there will be a solid improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fiscal deficit, but there are a lot of supportive elements in the form of trust banks and other Japanese institutional buyers backing the dollar,'' said the dealer. He spoke on condition of anonymity. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which rose 138.19 points Tuesday, posted a 84.29-point gain to close at 24,429.95.

 <PERSON> JoBeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> will portray surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television movie about the landmark court battle over custody of `` Baby M,'' a network spokeswoman said. The two-part movie, to air at an undetermined date this spring, will also feature <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON> said Tuesday. The goal of the movie `` is to tell the story without adopting any one point of view,'' Ms. <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The movie will include an update at the end because the case is still unfolding, Ms. <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON> said. The latest developments involve legal proceedings to determine the visitation schedule for Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, whose parental rights to the 22-month old child were restored in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision earlier this month. The state's highest court overturned a lower court decision that upheld a $ 10,000 contract under which Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> was artificially inseminated with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s sperm and bore the child for him and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. In addition to stripping Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> of her parental rights, the lower court last March 31 awarded custody to the Sterns.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s right to a fair trial in criminal court will be severely harmed if his impeachment trial starts Monday as scheduled, his lawyer told the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Tuesday that conducting the impeachment trial first would subject the criminal trial to prejudicial publicity. `` In my judgment he will be convicted in the criminal trial if this matter -LRB- the impeachment trial -RRB- is going to proceed and he is convicted here,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` It just is in the cards ... and I fear for his liberty.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was expected to decide late today whether to delay the impeachment trial. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON>, a Republican, said he expected the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to approve some type of delay but he would not predict how long it would be. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said that if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decides to go ahead with the trial next week, he will ask a court to halt it. However, some senators have questioned whether the courts have the authority to order the Legislature to delay an impeachment trial. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also decided to wait until today to reconsider a policy that allows all 30 senators to meet in closed conference during the impeachment trial. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved 23 articles of impeachment against the Republican governor Feb. 5, accusing him of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is scheduled to stand trial March 9 on six felony charges contained in an indictment that accuse him of fraud, perjury and filing false documents in connection with the $ 350,000 loan. He also faces a March 17 recall election. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial should be delayed until after the criminal trial, or at least delayed 90 days to give him more time to prepare his case. The House impeachment board of managers, which is overseeing the prosecution in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial, said in a written response that the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> does not require the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to await the outcome of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial. The five-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> board said a delay would leave the state government `` in limbo.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has asked Secretary of State <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who is acting governor, not to accept resignations from his staff and not to approve any tax increases, which he opposes. House counsel <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> said the criminal trial would not be over until mid - to late May at the earliest `` I think that's too long for the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to remain in a flux,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, a Republican, said he had examined the records of other impeachment trials and did not find that they had been delayed until after related criminal trials. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met briefly Tuesday in a closed session to discuss whether it should change its rule on closed conferences during the trial. The conferences would be intended to let senators meet with their lawyers, discuss possible questions to be asked and possibly to hold final deliberations. The policy has been criticized by the media, and 11 senators boycotted Tuesday's closed meeting.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Injunction On Japanese Gillnet Fishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court says Japanese salmon fishermen who accidentally catch seals, killer whales and other mammals are violating an animal protection law. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday upheld a preliminary injunction issued by a federal district judge last June that revoked a permit and halted gillnet fishing for salmon by Japanese fleets in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel rejected an appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the preliminary injunction issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The injunction was obtained by an environmental group and a native Alaskan fisherman's organization to stop the accidental taking of sea lions, fur seals, white porpoises and killer whales that could be ensnared in the nine-mile-long gillnets. As issued by the secretary of commerce, the three-year permit would have allowed the Japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5,250 Dall's porpoises in the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> _ including 789 in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The court ruled that the permit, which allowed the Japanese fishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took, violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

<HEAD>Court: Humane Society May Sue To Stop Hunting On Federal Preserves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has ruled the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> has legal standing to challenge the expansion of hunting on federal wildlife preserves. A three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday overturned a district judge's finding that the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lacked the requisite legal standing to sue the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to stop hunting on nine federal wildlife preserves. `` The gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting on wildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpses and environmental degradation, in addition to depleting the supply of animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view,'' the court said in an opinion written by Chief Judge <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who represented the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, called the decision significant because `` it confirms that environmental groups like the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> have the right to bring actions based on their members' concerns about harms to their aesthetic interests.''

<HEAD>Hart, Last Among Democrats, Says He's Looking For `Long-Term Gain'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who finished dead last in the primary he won in 1984, vowed to remain in the race despite his poor showing. `` We're going to take this fight all the way across this nation _ into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, into the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and then we're going to head West, where I live,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> told a roomful of supporters after finishing at the bottom of the Democratic field in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. In nearly complete returns, the former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator had just 4 percent of the vote, but put the best face on it. His showing, he said, was `` 500 percent better than <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' where he won barely 1 percent of the vote in last week's caucuses. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> dropped out of the race last May after questions surfaced about his relationship with model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. He returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to re-enter the race in December, soared for a time in the polls, then slumped to the back of the pack. Four years ago, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> stunned the political establishment by upsetting front-runner <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, gaining status as a credible candidate. He said he never expected to do that well again this year. `` We have just begun. We are committed,'' said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Earlier, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said his faltering campaign had enough money to last until delegate-rich Super Tuesday on March 8. `` I've always mentally prepared for a long-term gain, not a break-through early on,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. Campaign manager <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said the candidate had $ 400,000 in his campaign treasury _ enough, she said for three weeks of campaigning prior to the caucuses and primaries in the 20 Super Tuesday states. `` I do n't have to do what other candidates have to do,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, before the votes were tallied. `` Other candidates have to make a certain showing to get money and get support. We have support in 50 states.''

<TEXT>
 A group of leading Israeli writers called on the government to withdraw from the occupied territories and conduct direct negotiations with Palestinian leaders. `` I am in favor of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state alongside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as early as tomorrow morning,'' author <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Oz </PERSON> told more than 500 people who gathered to protest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policy in the occupied lands. `` I am in favor of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state ... because that is the way to life. Other ways lead to death.'' The Association of Israeli Playwrights organized Tuesday's gathering, which drew widely known actors, singers and poets, including several who had not previously expressed their views publicly on the unrest in the occupied lands One of them, poet <PERSON> Erez </PERSON> <PERSON> Biton </PERSON>, said that the riots in the occupied territories made it clear to him that through 20 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> had become a nation. `` I think this is the first time I'm not too mad at the Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Biton </PERSON> said. `` From their point of view, their behavior is absolutely one of honor.'' The disturbances, which broke out Dec. 8, have intensified the controversy among Israelis about what to do with the territories captured during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>, is against yielding any part of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in return for peace. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, favors compromise. Both Israeli leaders advocate peace talks with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and refuse to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which is outlawed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a terrorist group. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, the unrest has left 54 Palestinians dead, most by Israeli gunfire. The army has used live bullets, then rubber ones and finally beatings to quell the protests. Israeli troops have wounded or severely beaten hundreds of Palestinians and more than 1,000 others been detained or jailed. Oz said the Israeli crackdown on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrators was increasing hatred between Arabs and Israelis. He predicted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation would eventually collapse whether the two sides reach agreement or not <PERSON> Yehoshafat </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkabi </PERSON>, a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said Israelis and Arabs were beginning to realize they have no choice but to accept one another. `` The Arabs have learned that if the conflict continues it will become hell for both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arab countries,'' said <PERSON> Harkabi </PERSON>, a former army intelligence chief. `` Both the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the Israelis will suffer because both are in the same boat.'' <PERSON> Harkabi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must start negotiating right away. `` The longer we wait, the worse the conditions will be,'' he said. `` I realized long ago that if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> adopts a moderate policy we will achieve the best possible terms.'' Oz said peace advocates must persuade <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> voters to vote for left-wing parties in elections scheduled for the fall. `` We must try to talk seriously with the many people in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who are afraid to give -LRB- the West bank towns of -RRB- <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> back to the Arabs because they are afraid the <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> will chase us out of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> as well,'' Oz said. `` The feelings are complicated. They include an element of genuine fear, historical trauma, many years of Palestinian threats and an element of right-wing demagogy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Death Toll in Attack on Temple Rises to Seven</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two more people died today of injuries sustained in a grenade attack on a Hindu temple a day earlier, raising the death toll to seven, state-run Sri Lankan Radio said. The radio quoted hospital sources as saying two people succumbed to their injuries early this morning. All the victims were Tamil Hindus who were at the temple in southern <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> to celebrate the Mahashivaratri festival. Mahashivaratri day is celebrated as the birthday of Lord <ORGANIZATION> Shiva </ORGANIZATION>, one of the three major gods in the Hindu pantheon. More than 60 people were in the Sri Kathiresan Temple when two hand grenades were thrown into its inner chamber, witnesses said. Five people were killed on the spot. At least eight others remain hospitaized. Members of the main Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, are suspected of being behind the attack, a police officer connected with investigations said. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> attacked the temple because members of a rival militant group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, had sought refuge there. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, who have spearheaded a separatist guerrilla war for a Tamil homeland since 1983, often have been blamed for attacks on rival groups considered to be more moderate in their demands. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> condemned the assassination Tuesday of popular movie star and major politician <PERSON> Vijaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>. `` I have no doubt the whole island would consider this act of terrorism with horror and condemnation,'' <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> said in a statement published by local newspapers today. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>, son-in-law of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, was shot at his <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> residence by gunmen believed to belong to an outlawed Sinhalese group. Another person injured in the gunfire later died in hospital. State-run radio blamed the killings on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has vowed to attack supporters of a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil separatist war More than 150 killings have been blamed on the Front. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sponsored the peace accord last summer to bring the civil war to an end. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was a vocal supporter of the July 29 accord The Front claims the accord gives too many concessions to the Tamils and has compromised the sovereignty of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. More than 42,000 Indian soldiers have been deployed on the island under the terms of the accord to disarm Tamil rebels. <PERSON> Kumaranatunga </PERSON> acted in more than 100 Sinhalese films, mostly as the leading man. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, say they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who form 75 percent of the population. More than 8,000 people have been killed in the year separatist war.

<TEXT>
 It was a ballgame, a prize fight, a poker game and the always popular footrace. It was high stakes, make or break, a snowslide, the shoe on the other foot, popcorn in a microwave. Amid a muddle of metaphors, the networks struggled Tuesday night to impress viewers with the importance of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, occasionally noting with belated cynicism that if they were n't all there, it would n't really mean much. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> opened his newscast Tuesday by noting, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> ca n't make a candidate, but it certainly can break one.'' He was seconded by <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, who described the press attention on the nation's first presidential primary as smothering rather than covering and suggested `` one of the most interesting aspects of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary is not what we will know when it's over, but what we wo n't know.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surprisingly strong comeback was the obvious lead. On the Democratic side, losers were news. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won as expected, so the question became who among the remaining candidates would stay the course. For also-rans as well as front-runners, the task Tuesday night was putting on the best face for the national television audience. Former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who finished out of the money, told <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> he had managed to find his finish in the low one-digits `` disappointing but not discouraging.'' Later on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> noted more candidly of his third-place finish, `` This is n't helping.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, whose alleged `` mean-spiritedness'' became an issue in the campaign, did n't help his image. In <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION>'s piece on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, he was heard during a campaign stop muttering to an interloping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter, `` Go back to your cave.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> orchestrated the liveliest moment in the night's coverage, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the studio and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> live on a monitor. <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what he would like to say to his opponent. `` I wish him well and will see him in the South,'' said a cheerful <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But when <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> the same question, he snapped, `` Stop lying about my record.'' There were milder rematches between anchors and politicians. Rather interviewed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> live for the first time since their interview-turned-debate during the `` CBS Evening News'' last month that sparked a flurry of complaints about Rather's aggressive questioning. This time, Rather sat quietly and let <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talk, then happily characterized the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> win as `` a joy and a jubilation'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> again introduced <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> as a `` former television evangelist,'' a term that last week in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> prompted <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to suggest <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> was engaging in `` religious bigotry.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> let it slide Tuesday night. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> devoted most prime time to politics, but among the other three networks, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was the only one to pre-empt prime-time programming for election coverage with an hour-long special at 10 p.m. EST. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> wrapped up at midnight in lieu of airing `` Nightline.'' All the networks were set up in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and the candidates made the rounds all night, but <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bagged the idea of candidate interviews due to the late hour of its special. Its brief prime-time coverage no doubt had the biggest audience, however, since it interrupted Olympics coverage. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> wrapped up at 11:30 after devoting its regular weekly news documentary `` 48 Hours'' to the campaign trail. In a week when the show's format _ 48 hours of intense coverage _ should have been eminently adaptable to a breaking news story, `` 48 Hours'' fell flat, except for <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>'s poignant coverage of high-class loser <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. After his poor <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> showing, cameras caught two campaign workers embracing tearfully. `` We were the best,'' one said. `` No one will ever know it,'' added the other. The rest of the hour was about as exciting as watching political placards flapping in the breeze. Other moments worth noting: Most meaningful background report: <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>'s examination of the money issue and how it will determine who stays in the race. Most entertaining graphic: Those little straw hats on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. Most finely crafted simile: Rather's `` things are popping like the popcorn in one of those microwaves.'' Most eloquent comment: <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> noting, `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who said let the people decide. The people decided. He came in absolutely last.'' Most timely promo: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial for its 10 p.m. special, at 11 p.m.

 A grenade exploded outside a building housing the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and the death toll in bloody regional elections in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> climbed to at least 25, officials said today. The military reported that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels were suspected in the ambush of a Philippine Constabulary patrol Tuesday in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> province. Eight troopers were killed and another 10 wounded. A constabulary report said one rebel was believed killed but his body was carried away by his comrades. The military also reported that a rebel ammunition dump was discovered in <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ecija </LOCATION> province. It said troops recovered more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, 132 pounds of explosives and 125 blasting caps. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> said an M-2 grenade, rigged with a timer, exploded about 9 p.m. Tuesday outside the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>, shattering windows but causing no injuries. Another grenade was found on the ground floor but failed to explode, he said. The building houses the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, but Ambassador <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavesh </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he did not believe the embassy was the target. `` We do n't have any clues as to who could have possibly done it,'' <PERSON> Gavesh </PERSON> said. Communist rebels this month threatened to attack Israeli targets here because of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s alleged support of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government's anti-insurgency campaign. Israeli diplomats deny the Jewish state is involved in the campaign against the rebels. Philippine and Western intelligence sources say there are thousands of Palestinians and other Arabs living in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. In January, gunmen opened fire at the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> ambassador as he was leaving his office but he escaped injury. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said at least 25 people had been killed and 50 others injured during clashes between rival political factions in <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION> province, which erupted three days before last Monday's regional elections. The military sent 4,000 troops backed by helicopters and warships to the largely Moslem province to guard against election violence. <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION> was the last province to hold regional elections, which began Jan. 18. In other developments, an underground organization of pro-rebel priests and nuns today accused the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy of abandoning its mission to serve the poor by supporting President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s `` total war policy.'' `` By giving blessings to the total war policy of the U.S.-Aquino regime, the reactionary church leadership betrayed us all whom they are supposed to serve,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> group said in an advertisement in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. `` Due to their fear of anything red, they virtually abandoned their flock to be fed to the hungry wolves and modern day Neros,'' the group said, referring to the Roman emperor who persecuted Christians. The CNL is a branch of the Communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The statement followed recent charges by Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, that communists had infiltrated the church's social welfare agency. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said harsher laws are needed to combat the 19-year-old Communist insurrection and restore law and order in this turbulent country. But he said the rebellion was not at the stage where a state of national emergency was needed. During his press conference, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> noted that 18 months ago, he recommended that the government enact tougher laws to help the military fight the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. His recommendations included lengthening the time suspected rebels could be held without charge and restoring the death penalty for `` heinous crimes'' such as treason and rebellion.

<HEAD>Aging Plutonium Producer To Be Mothballed</HEAD>

 After months of debate, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has decided not to restart the flawed and aging N Reactor, one of four reactors supplying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal with bomb-grade plutonium. The N reactor has been closed since January 1987 for about $ 70 million worth of safety improvements prompted by the nuclear disaster that killed 31 people at the similarly designed <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear plant at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> announced Tuesday the reactor at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation will be placed on `` cold standby'' status, forcing about 2,600 workers to be laid off in the next two years. `` This decision signals the end of the plutonium production mission at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> site,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, Hanford operations manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Plans for the mothballing of the reactor will be included in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's proposed budget that will be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. A report prepared last year for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> projected that a gradual phase-out of plutonium-producing operations at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> by 1996 would result in the loss of more than 13,800 jobs in the state. Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and members of the state's congressional delegation pledged to seek a way to cushion the economic shock. But Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., said, `` Frankly, the most likely type of aid to come will be unemployment benefits. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the decision to mothball the reactor was based on a secret <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> review of the nation's future need for plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons. The Energy Department said demand for plutonium could be met by three reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and through plutonium recovery from nuclear weapons retired as a result of the recent U.S.-Soviet treaty. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors are running at 50 percent power because of safety concerns. The N Reactor, operated for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, shares several design characteristics with the Chernobyl plant, including graphite in the reactor core to moderate nuclear fission and lack of a containment dome. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the N Reactor, operated for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was considerably safer than the one at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. The fate of the reactor, the last of nine plutonium producers that have operated at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> since 1944, had been mired in controversy. Proponents said the nation needed the plutonium while opponents contended it did not, and that the reactor was unsafe. The `` cold standby'' status will begin next year shortly after the safety improvements are completed and tested. The reactor could be restarted, but that would take up to three years, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. The N reactor employs 3,300 of Hanford's 14,000 workers. The site is the biggest employer in the nearby cities of <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kennewick </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION>, which have a combined population of about 130,000. `` State agencies will do everything they can to help those who will be affected by the shutdown,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> said he and Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, both Democrats, planned to introduce a `` military waste cleanup bill that we hope will provide thousands of high-skilled jobs.'' Over 40 years of defense wastes are temporarily stored in tanks at the site. Under cold standby status, fuel will be removed from the reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Related plutonium processing plants, which employ more than 3,000 Hanford workers, will be gradually phased out in the 1990s as the stockpiled plutonium is exhausted, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. The decision to close the reactor ended a period of uncertainty for local officials and plant workers. `` I'm just glad that we finally know what the decision is,'' said Richland Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poynor </PERSON>. `` We'll survive this and come out stronger for it.'' `` The reality of it has n't hit home yet,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>, an N Reactor technician who learned of the decision as he came off the afternoon shift Tuesday. Hanford was built in 1943 as part of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project to produce atomic bombs. The N Reactor began operations in 1963. At more than 4,000 megawatts of thermal power, the N Reactor has the highest operating power of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reactor.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president told a visiting Soviet official the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies may try to gain influence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdraws its troops, a news agency reported today. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> met Tuesday night with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>. During the meeting, <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> a letter from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> which touched on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and other issues, the report said. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> left for home today, ending a six-day visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported, told <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was pleased with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and renewed a call for the speedy withdrawal of Soviet forces from that country, nine years after their intervention. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> issued a statement Feb. 8 saying the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would begin withdrawing its 115,000 troops May 15 if indirect talks between the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and Afghan governments produce an accord at least 60 days before that. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also stated for the first time that a pullout would not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a transitional Afghan regime which would oversee such a pullout. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was `` higly pessimistic about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern over <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and sees no sincerity in its -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- stance.

 The army ousted seven officers accused of involvement in revolts that occurred last month at six army camps and the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> metropolitan airport.

 Attorneys for relatives of a murdered woman will try to convince a federal jury that an ad in the military magazine Soldier of Fortune led to her death and that the magazine should pay them $ 22.5 million. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> was sent to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death row for paying $ 10,000 to a hitman to kill his wife, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>, in 1985. The alleged triggerman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>, is serving life terms in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for other killings. <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Einmann </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s mother, and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, the victim's 18-year-old son, contend in their civil suit that an ad <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> placed in the Denver-based publication brought him to the attention of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. They are seeking $ 2.5 million in actual damages and $ 20 million in punitive damages from the magazine, which calls itself a publication for professional adventurers. `` Our case is there was another party in this crime _ Soldier of Fortune,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, attorney for the plaintiffs, said at the start of the trial Tuesday. He accused the magazine of giving Black the means to accomplish the murder. Magazine attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> defended the publication of the ad. `` No one at Soldier of Fortune suspected anything criminal in that ad or any other ad in Soldier of Fortune. We think the evidence will clearly show Soldier of Fortune was not negligent,'' he said. Among questions asked prospective jurors earlier Tuesday before a panel was selected was whether they owned a gun or had watched `` Rambo'' and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> movies. The trial could last through next week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hittner </PERSON> said. The ad in question appeared in four issues of the magazine in late 1984, and sought former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and weapons specialists with jungle warfare expertise for `` high risk assignments'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or overseas. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said in a court deposition that he had received 10 to 20 calls a day in response to the ad. Most of the callers wanted to hire him for illegal acts, including kidnappings, bombings and murder, the network said. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> claimed he was contacted by one group to murder Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. `` From a defense perspective, there's no doubt <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Black </PERSON> met as a result of the ad,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` But that is the only thin thread with regard to Soldier of Fortune. With that ad, there was no way for anyone to determine he was seeking criminal conduct.'' `` You bet we're going to win,'' publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` I have no doubt about it.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, wearing a pin-striped suit and cowboy boots, flipped through the pages of one his magazines while <PERSON> Hittner </PERSON> took about an hour to review motions filed by attorneys in the case. The suit, filed 13 months ago, originally sought about $ 100 million in damages. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Einmann </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s father, recently and without explanation removed himself as a plaintiff. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, in arguments over pretrial motions, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has published and run ads in the magazine for books on learning how to be a commando. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says that never in his wildest dreams would he think that the ad would result in criminal conduct,'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said. `` Yet in the same issue of the magazine he has an ad for ` How To Be A Hitman.'''

<HEAD>Carnival Season Gives Way To Lent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The wild abandon of <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> gave way to the sobriety of Ash Wednesday today as police cleared the French Quarter of revelers hoping to forestall the end of the annual street party. Two fatal accidents involving parade floats marred the feverish excitement of the Carnival season, police said. Officially, the day concluded at midnight with the meetings of the courts of <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> and Comus, the signal that <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> has given way to 40 days of Lenten penance. `` I enjoy it to the max, but it's Ash Wednesday. <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> is over. The normal standards of behavior now apply,'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Seyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a resident of the French Quarter, said early today. Nearly a million people immersed themselves this year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' naughty exhibition of drinking, dancing and parading, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON>. Revelers not ready to give up the Fat Tuesday ghost were shooed into bars and clubs as uniformed officers and mounted police announced on bullhorns that streets were being reopened and cleanup crews were on their way. `` Mardi Gras 1988 is now over,'' police announced. `` Please clear the streets and get off the sidewalks.'' An 11-year-old boy was killed Tuesday afternoon when he was run over by a truck float in suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, and an unidentified man was killed when he leaped onto a tractor-trailer rig hauling a float in city traffic, police said. The last float-related death was in 1984, <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON> said. `` This does not happen every year,'' he said. `` The safety conscious individuals on the parade routes do not approach floats that are moving.'' Despite the accidents, which also included two incidents in which people were injured badly enough to be hospitalized, police described the crowds as generally well-behaved.

Though Tuesday's election was non-partisan, both <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> have served in the past as Democratic officeholders. Each had stressed goals of economic development and job creation in a campaign marked by few clashes, but their rhetoric showed signs of heating up Tuesday night. <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> promised he would tell voters how <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>'s campaign statements differed from past votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on issues affecting <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>, asked how he differed from his opponent, replied: `` I'd be the kind of mayor that would make a decision and stick with it.

<DATELINE>LIBERAL, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the sixth straight year, a British woman has defeated her American counterpart in the Shrove Tuesday international pancake race. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Strieff </PERSON>, who sprinted 415 yards carrying and flipping a pancake in a frying pan, crossed the finish line Tuesday in 67.7 seconds to lead the field of 13 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women here. But it was n't good enough _ <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> covered a similar course in <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in 62.9 seconds. Mrs. <PERSON> Strieff </PERSON>, 30, has won the Liberal leg of the trans-Atlantic race all three times she entered it. The rules prevent her from participating again. `` It's time for someone else to take a turn,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Strieff </PERSON> said. `` ... It would have been nice to have beat them at least once.'' According to legend, the race has been run in <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION> since 1445, when a forgetful housewife left for church on Shrove Tuesday with her frying pan still in her hand. Liberal made it an international event in 1950 by adding its own race after seeing reports of the English competition. Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday, is the day English women traditionally make pancakes to use up cooking fat before Lent. The teams have 19 victories apiece. They tied once. `` I did n't think of the pancake, I just ran,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a physical education teacher. `` I have n't done any training, though sometimes when I take the dog out for a walk, I have a little trot.'' At <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION>, about 700 spectators lined the twisting route as Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> outpaced 19 other women in the dash from the market square to the 14th century church in the town of 3,300 about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A crowd estimated at 3,000, including Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>, lined the route in Liberal, a community of about 17,000 just north of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Even more spectators turned out later for the Pancake Day Parade, said <PERSON> Rosalee </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, the secretary for the annual event. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> received her prize of 100 pounds, or $ 175, in cash, various gifts from town merchants, an inscribed silver tray from the town of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> and a kiss from <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Coverley </PERSON>, a ceremonial official known as the town verger. At Liberal, Mrs. <PERSON> Strieff </PERSON> got the kiss of peace from <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, British consul from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, along with roses, a crown, a $ 500 savings bond and other prizes.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar eased slightly against most major foreign currencies in early European trading today. Gold dropped slightly in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and held steady in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. Currency dealers said trading was thin because of holidays in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the lack of market-moving news. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, it was the first business day following a holiday in most parts of the country, and the first opportunity for many dealers to react to Friday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. The figures showed the trade deficit shrank in December to $ 12.2 billion from $ 13.2 billion in November. `` For some people, it's the first opportunity to take a position or take profits,'' said a dealer with an American bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar continued its decline against the Japanese yen, closing at 130.50 yen, down 0.99 yen from Tuesday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 130.45 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday: _ 1.7103 West German marks, down from 1.7120 _ 1.4050 Swiss francs, up from 1.4038 _ 5.7795 French francs, down from 5.7815 _ 1.9194 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9200 _ 1,258.50 Italian lire, down from 1,260.00 _ 1.2690 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2687 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7449, slightly more expensive <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for gold of $ 444 a troy ounce at mid-morning today, unchanged from the opening bid, but down from late Tuesday's $ 445.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 444.50, unchanged from Tuesday. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> markets were closed for the Chinese New Year.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Late-deciding Republican voters confounded the polls and boosted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to his convincing victory over Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential primary, analysts say. Voters who made their choice in the race's final days went strongly for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in part because of his superior campaign organization, his ties to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and his experience in office, exit polls indicated Tuesday. The result was a 9-point victory for the vice president, after some polls had shown him leading <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> just barely, by 4 points in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll and 2 points in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey. `` The voters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> have a well-deserved reputation of upsetting poll results, and tonight was a good example of that,'' said NBC News pollster <PERSON> Laurily </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>. `` People change their minds, and you ca n't poll for that.'' An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> exit poll found that 14 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> made up their minds on primary day, with 36 percent going for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 29 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Another 11 percent decided during the weekend, breaking 44 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 31 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` It was the undecideds. The undecideds went for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>, a poll analyst for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. A key reason: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s identification with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is very popular among New Hampshire Republicans `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coattails were there,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll consultant. `` People who like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were going strongly for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s exit poll supported that contention. Three-quarters of Republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>; 88 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s supporters held that view, compared with 66 percent of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s. There were fewer <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> backers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and more of them went for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> than for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, albeit narrowly, in the precinct caucuses Feb. 8. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won big there while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suffered a third-place embarrassment. <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s economic vitality could explain <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity in that state, and its benefit for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here, a belief that there may be a threat if I do n't go with someone who's following the same line,'' he said Perhaps for similar reasons, a third of Republicans said experience was the chief factor in their vote, and 54 percent of them voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to 37 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the CBS-Times poll said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won among Republicans looking chiefly for a strong leader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but that group made up just 19 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> total. Another key for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was his extensive campaign organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The CBS-Times poll found that 47 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his organization, while just 26 percent of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s supporters reported contact by the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign `` I think the thing that won it for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was his organization,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>, polling chief at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. While the polls did not anticipate the extent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory, <ORGANIZATION> Mitofsky </ORGANIZATION> said they did identify trends in the race: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> way ahead before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, dropping sharply after losing to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, then halting his slide and rebounding during the weekend. Speaking on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> credited his victory to a surge of support in the last 48 hours. `` I learned from that, fight back. Fight on,'' he said. `` It's taught me a good lesson: Do not be discouraged by the polling numbers.'' The exit poll results were less remarkable on the Democratic side, where <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won handily, as expected. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had him winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in organization. The poll results also indicated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backyard advantage. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said 55 percent of Democrats rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> above average as governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and 59 percent of them voted for him. Moreover, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found that 20 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Democratic voters moved there from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and four in 10 of them went for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s second-place finish appeared to be aided by his first-place showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Of the voters who made up their minds after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 27 percent went to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, 26 percent to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 20 percent to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who finished second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.

 A sailor who struck, spared and guttered his way through 14 days of bowling hopes to regain the world marathon record and raise some money for a good cause, his spokeswoman said. Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s scores for only the first 13 days, which ended at noon Sunday, will be submitted to the `` Guinness Book of World Records,'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Tuesday. King suffered from blistered, bloodied and swollen hands and feet but was pronounced in good condition at a hospital Monday and then went to a hotel that donated a suite for his use in recuperating, Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` He's feeling real well,'' she said. The 39-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> sailor's 312 hours of knocking pins down would easily top the existing record of 217 hours, 55 minutes, she said.

 A document purporting to announce a new state holiday honoring an Indian chief was a forgery, and state employees should plan to show up for work Friday, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. There will be no state holiday to honor Indian Chief <PERSON> Leschi </PERSON>, the governor's press secretary, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Milne </PERSON>, said Tuesday. `` It's a fairly elaborate scam someone is pulling here,'' <PERSON> Milne </PERSON> said of the bogus proclamation, which bore a slightly off-center state seal. The governor's signature is `` an obvious forgery,'' he said. And it's `` definitely not true'' that state employees, local government workers and school children have the day off, he stressed. The forged memo praises the Nisqually chief, `` the wise and generous <PERSON> Leschi </PERSON> who was treated most unjustly. To honor this distinguished orator and arbiter is an essential cornerstone of our state's history.'' The memo says Friday is a state holiday and that when Feb. 19 is on a weekend day, it will be celebrated on a Friday or Monday. `` We have n't even been asked -LRB- about designating the holiday -RRB- or even to issue a proclamation'' in commemoration of the day,'' <PERSON> Milne </PERSON> said. Besides, <PERSON> Milne </PERSON> said, only the Legislature has the authority to proclaim a state holiday. The governor's office has no idea who forged the document, <PERSON> Milne </PERSON> said, adding that the culprit had a good knowledge of Indian history.

 Minority students occupying a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> building remained today after they failed to agree on an understanding reached by their negotiators and college officials. `` I'm not disappointed. I'm tired. We've been going at this a long time,'' <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group, said at a 4 a.m. news conference announcing the deadlock. Two women wept in the halls of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after about 100 protesters debated for five hours on the administration's response to their eight demands The demands included suspending five white students accused of beating two blacks Feb. 7 and suspending campus police officers accused of forming a lineup of blacks the same night in their search for men who allegedly harassed women on campus. `` The students want immediate action, but the way the structure is set up, you ca n't get that,'' said a student negotiator, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the protesters planned to continue the debate at noon today in the building they have closed to whites since Friday. All but one of the nine student negotiators were pleased with the understanding reached with university Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> after four hours of talks Tuesday. `` Not all the demands have been met, but all have been responded to in good faith,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said as he forwarded a written statement to the students at 10:30 p.m Tuesday. `` There are things I can not do now, but we've agreed to plan to address general concerns.'' But the mood quickly changed when the demands and <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s response went before the 100 students occupying the building late Tuesday `` The vote is going very slowly and is being met with mixed emotions,'' <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, another spokesman for the protesters, reported as the debate wore on. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> had said the students were prepared to take over another building if they failed to reach an agreement with university officials. After the deadlock, however, he ruled it out. `` At this point it's too radical an approach,'' he said. He declined to give details about the debate except to say that students felt <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s response to their demands was vague. Administrators did not release the document sent to the students, but <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said it contained a promise of efforts to improve minority students' conditions and increase financing of minority programs. More than 500 white UMass students rallied Tuesday to support the occupation. `` Hey, ho, Chancellor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, racism has got to go,'' white supporters chanted as <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> made his way to the building. Students and faculty members also read letters of support at the rally, including a message from Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The students occupying the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have taken a principled position on legitimate concerns,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in his statement. `` The quality of leadership in the state and country can be determined by how it handles such crises as this one.'' The university moved classes that usually meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, and officials have said they do not intend to force the students out of the building. About 9 percent of the 25,000 students at the state's largest public university are minorities, including 641 blacks. Last year, the university disciplined six white students who pleaded no contest to charges stemming from a campus racial clash in which a black student was beaten after the final 1986 World Series game between the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has started dismantling some of its missiles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> although a superpower treaty scrapping intermediate-range nuclear missiles has not been ratified, a news agency reported. ADN, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency, said missiles stationed in <LOCATION> Waren </LOCATION>, 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION>, have been taken apart, put in crates and are ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` With this step we can make an important contribution toward disarmament even before the treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ratified,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> today printed a front-page report on the preparations for early removal of the missiles. <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> is north of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-. Troops in Waren dismantle ... rockets earlier than expected,'' Neues Deutschland -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- said in a headline to its story. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, agreeing to eliminate all land-based, medium - and shorter-range missiles The agreement stipulates that the Soviets' shorter-range missiles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are to be removed within 18 months and medium-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles within three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not ratified the treaty. The Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s parliament, is expected to approve the accord. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate reaction to the report. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, however, said the Soviets were free to take down their missiles before the treaty takes effect. The official, who demanded anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will go to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the Soviets were complying with the treaty, if it is ratified. Although there was no comment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the reported dismantling, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday criticized Western European countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower treaty. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as criticizing Western European governments for `` the latest wave of praise for the ` nuclear deterrence' strategy ... all manner of projects for the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the Franco-West German military rapprochement, and so forth.'' West German government officials declined comment on the report Tuesday night. `` It is too early for us to comment at this time,'' a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when they would be returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, only that Soviet soldiers `` are making the last preparations to return their SS-12 rockets.'' The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the intermediate-range missile treaty, which bans weapons with a range of 300 miles to 3,000 miles. East German television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading missile crates onto transport vehicles. ADN quoted a Soviet military officer as saying the `` troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit.'' The rockets are to be sent back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by train, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. It said East German journalists who toured the missile base were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the East German leader, indicated in January that Soviet intermediate-range rockets stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be removed ahead of schedule, but he gave no specific timetable. According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice missiles were stationed at the <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> site, which holds the largest numbers of SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There are three other SS-12 rocket sites in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In all, there are 54 SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, according to those figures. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also has 53 SS-23 shorter-range nuclear rockets in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 American labor leaders are breaking a four-decade tradition of unqualified support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, condemning its use of `` unneccessary force'' against Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The 14.3-million-member labor federation's executive council approved the first-ever rebuke of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Tuesday after meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who is scheduled to begin a tour of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> next week. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s winter meeting was <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' last stop of an extended weekend in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to gain support from traditional friends of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for his effort to soften <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s opposition to entering new peace negotiations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is seeking to promote a resumption of negotiations on Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied territories. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> addressed a meeting of the B'Nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> last Friday, seeking help from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish leaders in pressing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to show more flexibility. `` There's been so much emphasis on the process ... direct negotiations on the one hand, an international conference or some kind of international vehicle on the other ... that the discussion has become a little sterile,'' he told reporters Tuesday. `` If we are going to get going, we need to talk a little bit more about the substance of what might happen.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has opposed a resumption of negotiations if they are based on a premise that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will have to give up state control of some of the occupied territories as a condition for peace. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` not trying to stake out a position of one kind or another'' on that issue. However, he said getting `` to the substance in terms of things ... that would be talked about when people address ultimate resolutions of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict'' is needed to get the negotiations going again. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, while blaming Islamic fundamentalists for `` fueling the flames of violence in the occupied territories,'' said the Palestinian demonstrations did not warrant the `` unnecessary force'' used by Israeli defense forces on occasion. `` No doubt such incidents can be attributed to the inexperience of the Israeli army in riot control and other police functions, and to the frustrations of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers as they confront young Palestinians hurling stones and petrol bombs,'' the federation said. `` These factors may explain, but they can not excuse, and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> can not condone, the use of excessive force against civilians.'' The federation, however, rejected what it called a `` notion that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must now redeem itself by turning the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> over to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.''

 The somber young man refused to walk alone from the building in which he had hid atop a steam pipe for six hours while a gunman below shot seven people to death and wounded five others. `` I was there, above him, the whole time he was shooting,'' said the employee of the <ORGANIZATION> ESL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as he left the defense plant Tuesday in the company of a friend he had called to drive him home.

He spoke on condition of anonymity. Also today, the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> ambassador apologized to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials for saying the conduct of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied territories was worse than that of German troops who occupied <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> during World War II. Ambassador <PERSON> Torleiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> apologized after he was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and met with the ministry's political director-general, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>. Doctors at <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> said a 25-year-old <LOCATION> Shuyukh </LOCATION> resident was killed by a shot that pierced the heart. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified him as <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> doctors also said they treated four <LOCATION> Shuyukh </LOCATION> residents for gunshot wounds in the legs and arms and four women for beating injuries. One of the wounded, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumei </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from his hospital bed that soldiers had entered the village at about 5 a.m. to round up suspected agitators. `` They started breaking into houses and taking people away,'' said <PERSON> Rumei </PERSON>'s mother, who would not give her first name. She said soldiers clubbed her when she tried to stop them from detaining one of her sons. The army declared the village a closed military area, and soldiers turned back reporters who went to the scene in early afternoon. The army, meanwhile, clamped a curfew on the nearby village of <ORGANIZATION> Sair </ORGANIZATION>, the site of frequent anti-Israeli protests, the army official said. He said soldiers detained several residents, but did not have further details. During the meeting with the Norwegian ambssador, <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> expressed his `` sharp protest'' to <LOCATION> Anda </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Gol </PERSON>. `` The ambassador expressed regret that his words were understood in a way which has caused embarrassment,'' <PERSON> Gol </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> after the meeting that `` there was a misunderstanding that I wanted to compare these two regimes, and I'm very happy to have the opportunity to clarify.'' <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that many Norwegians were comparing the conduct of the Israeli army to the behavior of Nazi troops who occupied <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> for five years during World War II. `` What the Germans did, including beating and torturing prisoners and suspects, was very bad,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> as saying. `` But we do not remember them going out into the streets to break people's arms and legs or pulling children out of their homes at night.'' The army today said seven Palestinians were wounded late Tuesday in clashes at the Fawwar refugee camp south of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Aliya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said that, in addition to gunshot victims, they treated 12 Arabs who were injured by rubber bullets or beatings. Also Tuesday, soldiers shot and wounded two Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kabatiyeh </LOCATION> and a third in the nearby city of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army confirmed one protester was wounded in <LOCATION> Kabatiyeh </LOCATION>. In another development, Transport Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfu </PERSON> hinted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was involved in bombing the ferry that was to carry 130 deported Palestinians back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the voyage, has accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of responsibility for the bombing Monday at the port of <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION> warned that if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> bought another ship for the trip, `` its fate will be the same.'' Speaking on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio Tuesday, <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION> said: `` We knew we would n't allow the boat to reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. If we could prevent its departure, that was obviously the right thing to do.'' In Parliament Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was questioned about his policy of beating Palestinians to stop riots. He said the beating orders were necessary and `` to the best of my knowledge and judgment, are legal.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said soldiers have exceeded orders `` in many cases'' and confirmed troops used a bulldozer earlier this month to bury alive four Arabs near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The Arabs were saved by other Palestinians. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, deputy chief of staff, said a sergeant-major and a non-commissioned officer were detained in connection with the incident. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> said soldiers had no choice but to use beatings to try to curb nearly 2 -LCB- months of riots in the occupied lands. He said more than 200 Israelis had been injured, most of them lightly, and that 53 Arabs had been killed since disturbances began Dec. 8. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> puts the death toll at 54.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said today that unless he wins in either <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> next Tuesday, he will drop out of the race for president. `` I'm having a press conference ... where I'm going to say I have to win in either <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, receive additional funding from small donors ... or I'm going to have to withdraw from the race,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said his third-place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was `` strong,'' but added that he `` ca n't indefinitely come in second and third.'' `` We have a good base in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. ... I think we have a real shot at one or both of those states,'' he said. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> holds caucuses next Tuesday while <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> go to the polls in a primary election. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said earlier that while finishing behind <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> winner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and second-place <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was n't what he had hoped for, he will not change the focus of his campaign. `` No, absolutely not,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> said as he edged out of his election night headquarters amid a swarm of reporters and cameras. `` The message has to be the same. That's what I believe.'' Speaking earlier to supporters gathered at a restaurant, he vowed to be the advocate for `` a nation that once more cares for working men and women, that fights for the less fortunate, that stands up for middle-class Americans who want to send their children to college, that reaches out to build a world that is safer for our children and generations to come.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s national campaign spokesman attempted to put the best face on the third-place showing, maintaining that the candidate `` turned conventional wisdom topsy-turvy'' even before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> vote. Spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was able to blunt <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s momentum coming out of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was a lock for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has acknowledged that finances are a problem for his campaign, and he had hoped for a second-place showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to aid in fundraising. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaign had debts of about $ 500,000, with about $ 200,000 on hand, but expected to raise another $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 this week. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, after congratulating his backers for their efforts, urged them not to give up. `` You have not been campaigning just for some fellow wearing a bow tie,'' he said. `` You have been campaigning for a cause.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was accompanied on a makeshift stage by his wife, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, and other supporters when it partially collapsed as he began his remarks. Recovering quickly, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> joked, `` Believe it or not, the platform I stand on is a bit ` solider'.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, looking South after their one-two finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary, said today that campaign themes should not change with the region <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would withdraw from the race unless he wins one of two contests next week. `` People in the South are n't voting for a zip code. They're voting for the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, appearing on the same program, characterized his second place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> as a victory. `` The reason we won,'' he said, `` is because we got off the plane last week and began saying the same thing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> that we said in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the race still was `` wide open.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said it had now come down to him and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who came in third, said, `` I have to win either in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Otherwise I'm going to have to withdraw.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the three-term governor of next-door <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, won Tuesday's primary with a strong 17-percentage point margin over the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman. He was leaving today for the next major battleground, the South. Even as he did, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged that his victory did n't decide the race but drew the battle lines more clearly. `` I think it's going to go all the way to the last primary,'' he said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, whose victory in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses eight days earlier was largely overshadowed by the brawl on the Republican side, accomplished his chief aim _ finishing ahead of fellow <PERSON> Midwesterner </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` I love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` It's a result that we needed here,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` It appears to be that we've got a Dukakis-Gephardt race in the rest of the country, but that could change.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won 37 percent of the vote and said the victory gives him momentum heading into the delegate-rich primaries on March 8, when contests are set in every state of the South but one. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor won nearly as many votes as his next two closest challengers combined, and he was leaving immediately for the next round of campaigning in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Last week in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> our message started to shine through, and we won a bronze,'' he said, a reference to his third-place finish in that state's caucuses. `` Tonight here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, our message came through loud and clear. We went for the gold and we won it.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 20 percent and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator, had 17 percent. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 8 percent put him in fourth place, ahead of <PERSON> Tennessean </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s 7 percent. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> finished with just 5 percent and headed for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with advisers and wrestle with the question of whether to withdraw. Finishing last with 4 percent was <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the prohibitive front-runner a year ago who saw his presidential hopes wrecked with embarrassing disclosures about his personal life. When he re-entered the race in mid-December, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` let the people decide,'' and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> their decision was n't the one he wanted. He said it would take 30 to 60 days `` to determine if I can put together a viable candidacy,'' and suggested he may scale back the scope of his effort. `` It's a disappointing showing but we're not discouraged,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> before dawn for stops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, both of which have contests in the next three weeks. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was betting on gaining a boost in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and planned to be in that small state six out of the next seven days _ even though its primary next Tuesday is a beauty contest where voters express a preference but do n't award nominating delegates. He came into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> saddled with debt, as was <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Both face the prospect of a three-week campaign where the costs of buying television airtime across the South are enormous, and where they may be forced to select states to contest while bypassing others. `` We're not badly in debt,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` We're in good shape. Money is coming in.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s fifth-place finish was n't good enough to give him any boost going into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, as he had hoped. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spent a lot of money in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> but not a lot of time, and he departed the state for much of the final week while his competitors dominated the airwaves. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, which like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> has its contest next Tuesday and where he must do well to stay in the race. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had predicted he would beat <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and challenge <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but he insisted `` we're moving on.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, both of whom have an enormous stake in the Super Tuesday primaries across the South, were campaigning there today. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> watched the returns from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. All the candidates were converging on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the first of a series of Southern debates is set for Thursday night in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The Republicans debate there on Friday. Although the first primary of the 1988 campaign was likely to winnow the field, none of the losers displayed a willingness to leave the race right away. The most likely candidate appeared to be <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he talked with <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> about gaining an endorsement if the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor quits the race. `` No way,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> insisted when asked if he would withdraw. But he said he planned meetings with supporters to ask, `` Should I wage a guerrilla campaign or should I withdraw and do something else?'' Although far more was at stake in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, 18 nominating delegates were awarded by the primary results. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> collected 9, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 6 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 3. The rest got none.

 Police escorted <PERSON> Licio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> into a northern Italian prison today after he was extradited from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to face charges in the collapse of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest private bank, Italian media reported. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON>, 69, was taken to a prison on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Parma </LOCATION>, where high-security precautions include television monitoring of his cell and testing of his food for possible poisoning, according to state-run <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> radio. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> faces fraud charges related to the 1982 collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION>, the country's biggest private bank, which has close ties to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The Swiss supreme court rejected Italian extradition requests for alleged political crimes, including charges that <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> was involved in the Aug. 2, 1980, bombing of thee <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION> train station that killed 85 people and wounded 200. Under the terms of the extradition, <PERSON> Gell </PERSON>, also will be exempt from an eight-year jail sentence imposed by an Italian court that found him guilty of financing arms and explosives purchases by right-wing terrorists. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> surrendered to Swiss officials on Sept. 21, 1987, after being a fugitive for more than four years. He escaped from Champ-Dollon prison on Aug. 10, 1983, after serving only three days of a two-month sentence for entering <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on false papers. He also was awaiting extradition to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at the time. Swiss police originally arrested <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> in September 1982 when he tried to withdraw funds from a frozen <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> bank account linked to a South American branch of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has killed a bill to ban sex in city-owned or operated buildings, rejecting a councilman's argument that the measure was needed to stop harassment of female workers. `` There are already laws that take care of this matter,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, who moved to table the bill Tuesday night.

<TEXT>
 East German newspapers today printed pictures of dismantled missiles and hailed Soviet preparations for removing SS-12 nuclear missiles before a superpower treaty scrapping intermediate-range weapons is ratified. `` In the name of reason. A historic moment awaits,'' said a banner headline in the <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Young World -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s youth newspaper. `` Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-. Troops in Waren dismantle medium-range rockets earlier than expected,'' Neues Deutschland -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- said in a headline. <PERSON> Waren </PERSON> is 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> and about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Removal of missile troops ... starts earlier than expected. Transfer to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and destruction of their type SS-12 armaments in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Berliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday night that missiles in Waren had been taken apart, put in crates and were ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` With this step we can make an important contribution toward disarmament even before the treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ratified,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, agreeing to eliminate all land-based, medium - and shorter-range missiles The agreement stipulates that the Soviets' shorter-range missiles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are to be removed within 18 months and medium-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles within three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not ratified the treaty. The Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s parliament, is expected to approve the accord. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate reaction to the report. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, however, said the Soviets were free to take down their missiles before the treaty takes effect. The official, who demanded anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will go to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the Soviets were complying with the treaty, if it is ratified. Although there was no comment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the reported dismantling, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday criticized Western European countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower treaty. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as criticizing Western European governments for `` the latest wave of praise for the ` nuclear deterrence' strategy ... all manner of projects for the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the Franco-West German military rapprochement, and so forth.'' West German government officials declined comment on the report Tuesday night. `` It is too early for us to comment at this time,'' a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when they would be returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, only that Soviet soldiers `` are making the last preparations to return their SS-12 rockets.'' The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the intermediate-range missile treaty, which bans weapons with a range of 300 miles to 3,000 miles. East German television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading missile crates onto transport vehicles. ADN quoted a Soviet military officer as saying the `` troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit.'' The rockets are to be sent back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by train, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. It said East German journalists who toured the missile base were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the East German leader, indicated in January that Soviet intermediate-range rockets stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be removed ahead of schedule, but he gave no specific timetable. According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice missiles were stationed at the <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> site, which holds the largest numbers of SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There are three other SS-12 rocket sites in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In all, there are 54 SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, according to those figures. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also has 53 SS-23 shorter-range nuclear rockets in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Legislation prohibiting local governments from promoting homosexuality is virtually certain to become law after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> defeated an amendment that would have limited the measure to state-owned schools. The Lords, the unelected upper chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, voted 90-48 on Tuesday night to defeat the amendment. The restriction on promoting homosexuality is included in a legislative package proposed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative administration The vote represented the legislation's last parliamentary hurdle and the package has been penciled in for entry onto the statute books on June 1. The package only needs to complete a formal final reading in Parliament for it to become law. The bill stipulate that local authorities _ which run public libraries, some theaters and most state schools _ must not `` intentionally promote homosexuality.'' Authorities that defy the ban can be sued by individuals or penalized by auditors for misusing funds, according to the legislation. The amendment defeated by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> sought to limit the ban on promoting homosexuality to one area only _ state-owned schools. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, also tried to include wording saying the proposed law is not a license to discriminate against homosexuals, but his effort failed when the time allotted for debate ran out. Arguing for the measure, Home Office Minister Lord <ORGANIZATION> Caithness </ORGANIZATION> said `` gay pride'' programs and the promotion of gay rights in youth clubs run by some local authorities sought to glamorize homosexuality. `` Young people are susceptible to these intolerable influences... Activities such as a Lesbian Gay Strength and Pride Week are, in the government's view, at least as likely to glamorize homosexuality in the minds of impressionable young people as anything a teacher might do,'' he said Lord Longford of the socialist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> the measure smacked of a `` general queer-bashing campaign.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> complained last fall that children were being taught `` they have an inalienable right to be gay.'' Her government has accused some left-wing local authorities of using state funds to promote homosexuality. Leftist local governments, including those running inner city <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the northern cities of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, have been criticized by conservative newspapers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for giving grants to gay and lesbian community groups. The government also has acted to curb spending by local authorities and plans shortly to introduce controls on what is taught in state-owned schools, whose day-to-day running is in the hands of local government. Critics said the homosexuality measure, known as Clause 28, was a setback for gay rights in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and a swing toward authoritanian rule by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her government. Walls in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and other cities were covered with slogans attacking Clause 28 as repressive legislation. Some critics of the measure also said the word `` promote'' is so vague it could allow local authorities to censor works by <PERSON> E.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> and other famous homosexual writers in public libraries and theaters. The government has denied prejudice and dismissed that criticism. Homosexual acts in private between consenting civilian males who are at least 21 years old were legalized by the Sexual Offenses Act in 1967, although the age limit is widely ignored by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s gay community. Homosexuality between males in the armed forces is outlawed. For centuries until 1836, the death penalty was used to deter sodomy in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Until 1967, it was punishable by imprisonment. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>, the homosexual Irish-born playwright, was sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labor in 1895, and, until the passing of the 1967 act, male homosexuals lived in constant fear of blackmail. The 1967 act referred only to males, as British law has never banned lesbianism.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, rejoicing that `` we went for the gold and won it'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s presidential primary, sought today to parlay that glitter into solid Southern support. `` People in the South are n't voting for a ZIP code; they're voting for the president ... The next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has got to be somebody who can bring this country together,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' While polls show him in the middle of the pack in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where most states hold primaries or caucuses on March 8, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes what worked in next-door <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> will play in <LOCATION> Dixie </LOCATION> as well. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was flying today to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> for rallies. `` I had to prove to them that I was a viable candidate for the presidency,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The South is very much a part of this country. The goals, dreams, the values of the South are very much the same as the northeast.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scored a convincing win over <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who in turn edged Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, who has financial worries. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` I would think it's going to be difficult'' for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to continue in the race. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor faces strong Southern competition from two Democrats who finished behind the front-runners in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is also expected to do well in the South. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was looking ahead to the Southern battle even as he made his victory speech in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` Some people have been asking how a New Englander can hope to do well on Super Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` They want to know what my ` Southern strategy' is. The fact of the matter is, I do n't have a southern strategy. I do n't have a northern strategy or a western strategy. I have an American strategy. `` I believe in the kind of politics where you say the same thing, wherever you go in our country. A campaign that unites <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and does n't divide it. The people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are n't asking where candidates are from. They're asking where they'll take us.'' Overall, the speech focused on principles and general ideas, for the most part, and stayed clear of specifics and political details. `` Thank you, the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, for starting us off on the road to the White House,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a gathering of about 1,000 supporters in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said the governor plans to spend nearly $ 4 million in the South. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, for his part, has launched a $ 1 million media campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was confident enough about Tuesday's outcome to talk about his plans for Super Tuesday before the polls closed. The March 8 presidential extravaganza involves primaries and caucuses in 20 states, including 14 southern and border states. `` We're going to contest every one of those states,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I think we're going to surprise some people in the South.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> said today that while he was concentrating on the South his presidential rivals picked up harmful `` political baggage'' by taking narrow positions while campaigning in other parts of the nation. `` They all came out for mandatory controls on agricultural products ... that would be a disaster in the South,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' Overall, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> says, he has no regrets about skipping the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary because there was no point in spending `` $ 1 million on two or three delegates.'' `` We're saving that for the 1,400 delegates here in the Super Tuesday states,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said Tuesday night after meeting with a group of about 20 <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businessmen including former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> maintained his focus on Southern states involved in next month's Super Tuesday primaries while most presidential candidates were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> awaiting results of that state's leadoff primary. `` We made a decision not to spend $ 1 million on two or three delegates,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaigned little in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and finished fifth in the Democratic race there with about 7 percent of the votes. He said that was better than he expected but the big test is yet to come. `` Super Tuesday changes all the rules,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I think what we've seen were some rather inconclusive results in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and the fact that the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> momentum did not have much of an impact on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> indicates that Super Tuesday is a completely new ball game.'' He said the candidates involved in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> are bringing to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other Super Tuesday states a set of positions on issues that are not in touch with mainstream voters. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign already has started television commercials in major markets in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as well as national advertisements on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and cable-distributed <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Augsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> officials have changed their minds about naming part of a new building after a major donor because they learned he had mailed thousands of hostile letters to interracial families. The college will, however, keep the $ 500,000 <ORGANIZATION> Elroy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> donated last year, as well as other contributions made over 20 years. `` The positions and actions of Mr. <PERSON> Elroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, as reported in the media, have disturbed, angered and saddened hundreds of individuals and families, including members of the <LOCATION> Augsburg </LOCATION> community,'' college President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Tuesday after a regents committee meeting. `` For some persons, to have the name of Mr. <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> on a wing of our new building would be misunderstood to mean the college agrees with his stance,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who is white and has a black daughter-in-law, said he received three anonymous letters himself from Stock. Stock, a 65-year-old retired executive of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who lives in <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION>, gave the <PERSON> Lutheren </PERSON> college $ 500,000 for a new worship, drama and communication building. It was the largest single gift last year to the college, which has 2,100 students. `` Mr. <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>'s way of acquiring the funds is through honest work,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` Whatever Mr. <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> has done, he has had an opportunity to use his means to do some good for a lot of people. I see no reason why he should be denied that opportunity.'' Stock, a 1949 <LOCATION> Augsburg </LOCATION> graduate, told <ORGANIZATION> WCCO-TV </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision not to name the building wing after him. `` It's all over,'' he said. `` I do n't want to even think about it. If they want to take it off, I'm not going to care.'' <ORGANIZATION> WCCO-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> had been sending unsigned letters to interracial couples for 14 years. The station said the letters included such comments as, `` A dog breeder would not think of producing mongrel dogs, so why should the human race be mongrel?'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he was convinced after meeting with <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> over the weekend that <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> is sorry he hurt people with the mailings. After a five-year investigation, postal officials linked the letters to Stock in early 1987, said <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> McKusick </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service inspector. <PERSON> McKusick </PERSON> had received about 1,000 complaints, the earliest dating to about 1982. But Stock could not be prosecuted because he had not broken any laws. Complaints ceased shortly after Stock was confronted by authorities in March 1987, <PERSON> McKusick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said no one at the college was aware of the situation until school officials were contacted by <ORGANIZATION> WCCO </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, beaten back by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Republican primary, today renewed his allegations that the vice president had distorted his record and promised to counterattack, while <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he could unite the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s conservative wing From top to bottom, the 1988 Republican presidential race was as hot and furious after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary as it had been before. No one talked of withdrawal and all looked south for new battles. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied that his campaign had distorted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record `` I'm sorry he feels that way,'' the vice president said in an interview aired today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. Interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp first tried `` character assassination'' in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` That did n't work,'' he said, `` so they start on distorting your record. ... Unless they want to get back on the straight and narrow and withdraw some of their attacks, we're going to have to counterattack.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said that although he finished third overall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contest, he was first among the conservatives. And he said he could `` bridge the gap'' between the conservative wing and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s `` evangelical Christian'' wing. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was crowing because he finished ahead of former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former television evangelist. A week ago, he finished a weak fourth in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was second. In the first-in-the-nation balloting, here were the numbers at the end of the counting: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 39 percent and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 29 percent. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had 13 percent; du Pont, 10 percent; and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 10 percent. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, who dropped out of the race Friday, got less than 1 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> were slated to be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, while du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, two Southern states where he hopes to win a few primaries early next month. `` Tomorrow morning we go into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and they're going to be playing in my backyard,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` I'm throwing the gauntlet down to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is the first Super Tuesday state and I'm going to beat you there convincingly.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> holds a Republican primary on March 5, three days before the Super Tuesday mega-primary on March 8. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who won the endorsement of the Union Leader of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> but did not turn that into a victory, vowed to press on. `` I'm going south ... without question,'' he said. `` We did much better in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> than we did in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. We'll do much better in the south than we did in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> ... The point is, we've all finished together, probably within a half point of each other.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed heartfelt thanks to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Republicans, whom he told a week ago `` I'm one of you.'' `` Thank you, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` On to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where we're going to rise again.'' The battling to get into place for Super Tuesday _ when 16 states will hold <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> events _ began even before the tally was finished in the Granite State. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was being interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, when the anchorman turned and asked if <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had anything to say to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Yeah, quit lying about my record,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said testily. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ads that claimed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> wants to raise taxes just are n't true. `` I do n't mind being attacked on my record when we have a difference, but to just right out, flat out, distort the record, then I think we need to call attention to that,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` It's unfortunate that the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who knows better, would sink to that level. Asked later about the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> remark, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know what he's talking about.'' `` If it had n't been for the distortion of my positions on tax increases and an oil import fee, I'd be 10 points ahead,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had been riding a wave out of his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> win a week ago Monday, rising to as much as an eight-point lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in some overnight polls. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his campaign did an about-face in the middle of the week _ dropping the formal campaign style, launching the attacks on <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record and talking a lot about himself and his own feelings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also helped by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where the administration is blamed for economic woes, his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tie was a liability. And at the end of the week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought in conservative hero <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> to polish his conservative credentials. And he stood on the stage with baseball hero <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, adding a celebrity sheen in a state that watched <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> perform miracles for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>.

 A man who first said strong winds blew his bride off a cruise ship now claims <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret agents killed his wife in retribution for a book he wrote about human rights abuses. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>, 36, who is being held for investigation of murdering his wife, 26-year-old <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltz </PERSON> <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>, made the allegation Tuesday in a statement released by his lawyer after an appearance in federal court. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office said Mrs. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> died from `` strangulation associated with drowning, which was determined to be a homicide.'' Doctors performing the autopsy found contusions on Mrs. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>'s neck as well as other signs she had been in a struggle, according to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> initially had said his wife had been blown overboard by wind while jogging Saturday aboard the Star Dancer as it returned to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from their honeymoon cruise. The ship's captain, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildung </PERSON>, said winds were light. In his new statement, <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> claimed the agents drugged him, leaving him with no memory of that night. He said Israeli agents had tried unsuccessfully to kidnap him in the past and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents also had pursued him because he held documents showing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government involvement in what he called <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` gross violation of human rights.'' `` He feels that this murder is the result of a book he published last year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in which he exposed the numerous human rights abuses which he perceived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said he would seek a psychiatric examination of his client and added that <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> may have received a psychiatric discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>FAA Proposes Rule To Expand Use Of Aircraft Altitude-Reporting
Transponders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> wants all aircraft operating near 254 of the nation's airports to have devices that automatically inform air traffic controllers of a plane's altitude. The devices, called Mode C transponders, are already required on commercial aircraft. The regulation, proposed Tuesday, would affect private planes operating within 40 miles of the designated airports. The regulation would also require all aircraft operating at 6,000 feet or move above the surface in controlled airspace to carry the transponders. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said increased use of the devices would ease the burden on controllers and reduce the potential for collisions and close encounters between planes. `` By taking advantage of the existing aviation technology, this rule, if adopted, will provide a significant enhancement to the safety of our nation's flying public,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. The proposed rule would implement legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to require expanded use of the transponders. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> now requires the transponders for aircraft operating at 12,500 feet or more above sea level and in so-called terminal control areas around the nation's 23-busiest airports. Last June, the agency proposed a rule requiring Mode C transponders for aircraft operating within 30 miles of such airports. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said increased use of the transponders allows the display of altitude information on an air traffic controller's radar screen, can warn controllers of possible conflicts, provide low-altitude warnings, and activate a collision-avoidance system in aircraft that have such a system The proposed rule will be open to public comment through March 28.

 Republican <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, armed with a third-place <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> finish ahead of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, predicted today that he would continue to do well against his fellow conservative in the Southern primaries. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is `` certainly a conservative but a rather negative conservative,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> can ultimately be the candidate of the conservative South.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' celebrated his finish ahead of former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> as a victory in a `` race for the conservatives'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said that race was separate from the `` race for the traditional, moderate wing of the party'' between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` I'd like <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> to withdraw,'' he added wryly. Final unofficial results from Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary gave <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 13 percent of the vote, placing him behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had 38 percent, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at 29 percent. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> each received 10 percent, with du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> slightly ahead. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman called the results a victory, particularly after <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s surprise second-place finish in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. `` There's two contests in this party,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, his family at his side, told about 400 supporters at a hotel ballroom bedecked with red, white and blue balloons. `` There's the contest for the establishment wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and there is a contest for the conservative wing. We won the contest for the conservative wing ... `` And the thing that's happening now _ and you can feel it right here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ finally we've dragged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> out of discussing their resumes and their tax returns and where they're born and into discussing issues. `` With you and the type of folks that you represent around this country, ladies and gentlemen, the growth, hope and opportunity wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is going to prevail over the orthodox, status-quo wing of our party,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> campaign adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the third-place finish would help <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> substantially in the South. `` As the agenda moves <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, it's the most conservative part of the country, and we think his message will be well accepted there,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` A former pro football player who's a strong anti-communist and is strong on defense issues is better for the South than a <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> son of a Wall Street banker,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the campaign has about $ 100,000 on hand and a list of 100,000 donors nationwide. He predicted that Tuesday's results will increase <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ability to raise funds.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today that his fourth place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Democratic primary `` proved we could broaden our base'' and that he expects to win as the presidential campaign moves South. `` Our message of end economic violence and stop drugs from coming into our country hit at the heart of the families of working people,'' he said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning.'' He said that in both <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, `` We proved that we could broaden our base, appeal to voters across the country.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished ahead of rivals <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> in Tuesday night's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses He already has met with <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> to ask for his support. `` In many ways, he has been a part of the heart and soul of this campaign,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. `` We have an awful lot in common.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had campaign appearances scheduled today in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` I'm a son of the South. I know its ways,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native, said after the returns were counted Tuesday night. `` I've worked harder and longer to make the new South new than anyone in this campaign,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, citing his work for voting rights and open housing. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was particularly jubilant about his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> showing. He said his campaign spent only $ 45,000 in the state, far less than opponents <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, yet it gathered enough support to give him momemtum going into Super Tuesday. `` We defied the odds. ... They outspent us 10-to-one, and yet we keep getting stronger and stronger and stronger,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who also eschewed a strong <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> effort in favor of southern campaigning, will not pose a problem for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the civil rights leader said. `` I'm not worried about anybody,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also jabbed at primary winner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We can not just take the uncollected taxes of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan to cut federal budget deficits by collecting $ 110 billion in overdue income taxes. Supporters, who munched on cold fried chicken and clustered around televisions to check on network projections, said fourth place was more than satisfactory. `` It's real acceptable. Fourth is about what we'd like to do here, so we're happy,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushing </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s state campaign co-chairman

<HEAD>Year of the Dragon Greeted With Fireworks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fountains of pink and green sparks shot up from alleys and bangs and crackles filled the air as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today welcomed the Year of the Dragon with the traditional fireworks greeting. The government decreed a cutback this year in firecracker sales in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> due to the high toll in injuries and property damage. But when midnight struck, residents brought out their firepower in force. The Lunar New Year, renamed Spring Festival after the 1949 Communist takeover, traditionally is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most important holiday. It has been welcomed with more than usual fanfare because this is the Year of the Dragon, the most auspicious of the 12 animals in Chinese astrology. The symbol of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is considered lucky for business, marriage and the `` dragon babies'' born before it ends. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ushered in the Lunar New Year with an official remembrance of its historic Tet Offensive 20 years ago. The official <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> radio recounted myths of the dragon. But much of the broadcast, punctuated by the sounds of battle, was devoted to recalling the offensive that began Jan. 30, 1968. Communist forces then attacked more than 100 cities and towns throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, suffering enormous casualties as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Vietnamese forces drove them back. The offensive convinced some Americans the war was unwinnable and fueled the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-war movement instrumental in achieving an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> withdrawal in late 1973. The communists went on to win in 1975. `` The attacks sent shock waves across the world and shook the White House,'' said the broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ruling circles were forced to think of a withdrawal and to sit down at the negotiating table in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, millions of people crowded trains and buses to join their families for the New Year's celebration, which begins on Thursday in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. As many as 7 million people were expected to travel cross-country to spend the holiday feasting, playing traditional games and enjoying other festivities. Nearly everyone in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> _ wealthy businessmen, factory workers, maids, restaurant waiters _ left their jobs to welcome the Lunar New Year with feasts, gambling and visits to relatives with gifts of candy and `` Lai See'' -LRB- Lucky Money -RRB- for children. Top Chinese leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> welcomed the New Year at a party in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the 83-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s first reported public appearance since Jan. 20. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> received an ovation from the more than 700 people attending the party at the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exhibition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and that he waved back, `` all smiles.'' Markets in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were crammed with festival foods, railroad stations were full of holiday travelers and signs emblazoned with dragons heralded the start of the year 4686. Thousands of people from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalists fled after the communist victory of 1949, were expected to visit the mainland Last year, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s government lifted a ban on visits to allow family reunions. Government statistics indicate about 400,000 of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 5.7 million people had left by Tuesday for holidays abroad, and many more were expected to go. The pro-Beijing <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimated 1.8 million people from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> would spend the holiday in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, primarily in the neighboring province of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>, where many have their ancestral roots. A company official said about 6,000 people from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were expected to visit the mainland. During the New Year festivities, normally thrifty Chinese throw financial caution to the winds and blow several months' pay on good cheer, gifts and games of chance. About $ 2.7 million worth of fireworks were sold in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last year and some families spent as much as $ 54, the equivalent of two months' pay. This year, the government reduced the supply by 30 percent. Fireworks were blamed last year for 3,040 fires that killed 17 people and caused nearly $ 1 million in damage.

<HEAD>Defense Issues Likely On Agenda When Chancellor Visits Washington</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Key defense issues such as short-range nuclear missiles and chemical weapons are likely to be on the agenda when Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> meets with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today for the three-day visit that will include talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and leading members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition Social Democratic party called on the chancellor to press for a reduction in short-range nuclear missiles in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> talks. `` The chancellor should work toward a concept for the withdrawal of short-range missiles,'' the party's arms control expert, <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON>, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Neuen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osnabruecker </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying. In recent days, West German government officials have pointed out differences of opinion on these topics and urged the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance to develop an overall arms control strategy before pursuing new talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Before we sit at the table with the Soviets on new -LRB- disarmament -RRB- proposals, we need to have agreement within the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- alliance on overall strategy,'' a top-ranking West German official told reporters Tuesday. Officials said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is likely to press for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said it would be difficult to verify such a ban, but West German experts contend that verification problems can be worked out. `` We think the -LRB- East-West -RRB- chemical weapons talks have reached a point where it is possible to reach an agreement this year,'' said the West German official, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified. The official said West Germans are aware that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiators are emphasizing working out reductions in strategic nuclear weapons and do n't feel that the Geneva-based chemical weapons talks are on the brink of agreement. `` But it is important for us to represent our European interests within the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- alliance,'' he added. Short-range nuclear missiles, or those with a range of less than 300 miles, are expected to be a main point of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in recent weeks have emphasized the importance of implementing a 1983 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decision to upgrade the short-range nuclear weapons in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the short-range missiles are now more important to the alliance because of last December's superpower arms treaty which, if ratified, will scrap all land-based, medium-range missiles But the West German government says <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must first develop overall arms control strategies and insists on reductions in Soviet superiority in conventional arms before upgrading the alliance's short-range missiles `` The Federal Republic -LRB- of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- sees no need for an isolated decision on modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear weapon systems at this point,'' <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>, chief government spokesman, said Monday. `` Such decisions should be taken only after new overall -LRB- disarmament -RRB- concepts are worked out,'' he added.

 A woman who police say gave birth to premature twin boys in her apartment and then smoked cocaine while they died in her bathroom has been charged with two counts of murder. The charges were filed Tuesday against <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 36. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s `` behavior during the pregnancy and after the births caused the deaths,'' by <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, senior deputy <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney. Sgt. C.D. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the woman told him `` when you're smoking cocaine, your reasoning goes out the window.'' She said she gave birth to the first baby Thursday morning and left him squalling on the bathroom floor while she returned to her bedroom to continue using cocaine, officers said. She gave birth to the second infant in the afternoon, leaving it wrapped in a towel in the bathroom. It was not until Thursday night, when she thought she was going to pass out from blood loss, that <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> called an ambulance, she told authorities. She did not mention the births until she was en route to the hospital, police said. Police found the infants' bodies after being notified by a paramedic who had taken <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Merritt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Escape System Decision Due in April</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says it will choose in April between two crew escape systems for the space shuttle, in time to install the system in the shuttle Discovery for the restart of the manned flight program. Discovery now is scheduled to lift off from the Kennedy Space Center on Aug. 4. It already is outfitted with an escape hatch that can be jettisoned with explosives, a change from previous flights, in which opening the hatch was a laborious, time-consuming effort. One of the emergency systems would have crew members, one at a time, hook on to small tractor rockets stored in the cabin. The astronauts would be pulled clear of the spacecraft and would parachute to the ocean. The second system, first tested in wind tunnels and now by military volunteers in C-141 aircraft at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, involves a telescoping pole that would extend down and to the rear of the shuttle. Astronauts would attach themselves to rings on the pole, slide clear of the shuttle and then parachute. `` The two systems, the pole and the rocket, both provide the capability for us to get away from the wing should we have to jump out the side,'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, commander of the five-man crew on the first mission, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing Tuesday. `` If both those tests turn out to be adequate to do the job, I think it would be common sense that we would prefer to have the system that is the simplest, that involves the least amount of potential hazard.'' The escape system would be useful only on a controlled, level flight, not while the shuttle's booster rockets are firing, as was the case in the Challenger accident in 1986.

<TEXT>
 An Afghan guerrilla leader today urged <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> not to sign an agreement to end the civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> unless an opposition government is established there first. `` It will be a historic blunder if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> signs the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> peace agreements in their present forms,'' <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, told a news conference. Meanwhile, a Soviet foreign ministry official accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of trying to delay the pullout by demanding an agreement on the makeup of a new interim Afghan government. A final round of the U.N.-sponsored talks between <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is to open in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on March 2. Negotiators are expected to try to reach peace agreements to end the eight-year war, which has pitted the Moslem guerrillas against an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops and a small Afghan army. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other countries support the guerrillas and are represented by <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. Soviet views are represented by officials from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, who heads the largest group in the seven-party guerrilla alliance headquartered in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> should retain its present demand for a government dominated by the guerrillas and shared by other Afghans to be installed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> before a peace accord is signed. In a statement Feb. 8, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to start withdrawing his troops on May 15, provided the peace agreements are signed by March 15. He said that a pullout would not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a transitional Afghan government. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the proposal implied that the Moscow-backed government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> would remain in power and the insurgents would play no role. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal will cunningly leave the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government in power when the Soviets withdraw, and Afghan refugees will be allowed to return home. But it will not lead to peace,'' said <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, considered among the most hardline of the guerrilla leaders. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> renewed the guerrillas' call for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to begin direct talks with the guerillas. The Soviets and the insurgents, he said, are the only parties involved in the Afghan fighting. Such negotiations could lead to the formation of an interim government which will organize elections to establish a permanent elected government and a parliament, he said. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the seven guerrilla parties would draw up a list of people acceptable for the proposed government. The names would include guerrillas, Afghan refugees and Afghan Moslems and exclude communists, he said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has been trying to delay the pullout by urging the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to find a formula for a future Afghan government. `` A domestic Afghan settlement is a cause for the Afghans themselves. And it depends only on them which ways to choose for the purpose,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. Outside parties can assist the process, but not at the expense of the withdrawal talks, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said in remarks reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. He said `` the Pakistani side's attempts to keep away from concluding the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> process are tantamount to an intention to frustrate the entire Afghan settlement.'' The Pakistani <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Feb. 16 that only by linking its withdrawal to an agreement on an interim government could the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> assure an end to the fighting. Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told the Soviet deputy foreign minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> that any pullout accord must prevent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies from wielding influence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, according to a report broadcast Tuesday by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one pro-Soviet government with another, and remained to fight the insurgents. Many of the guerrilla groups fight from bases across the border in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Swapp Says He's Sorry Officer Killed, But Says He Warned The

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leader of the polygamist family that held off police for 13 days says he's sorry a corrections officer was killed in the shootout that ended the siege, but that authorities had been warned not to go onto the property. And <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 26, who was wounded in the gunfight, said he learned in a divine revelation that his life was spared because of his willingness to risk all for God. Swapp is being held in the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> pending trial on attempted murder and bombing charges. The bombing charges stem from an explosion at a Mormon chapel a half-mile from the polygamists' farm at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The explosion led authorities to stake out the compound and to the 13-day standoff. Another family member is suspected in the fatal shooting of Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, a dog handler with the state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The bombing allegedly was in revenge for the death of polygamist patriarch <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, who was killed in a confrontation with authorities nine years ago. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> is married to two of Singer's daughters, and was a leader of the family along with Singer's widow, They blame the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, of which their group is an offshoot, and police in Singer's death. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, in a telephone call to <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribune </LOCATION> from jail, brought up Singer's death, saying, `` Two people died in all of this, just remember that,'' and Singer's `` blood still lies on the ground there, too.'' His comments were published in today's Tribune. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> noted that he had warned of possible violence in a letter to the governor. His note said in part, `` TAKE A WARNING _ any man of yours which attempts to cross the Boundaries of this place, without our Permission, will be treated as an aggressive act on your part and we will Defend ourselves in any matter we see fit.'' `` And that's what happened,'' <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said. Asked if he felt bad about the death, he said, `` Very. Yes I do. ... Of course, I do.'' <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said he was surprised to find himself in jail but believes <PERSON> God </PERSON> wants him there for a new mission. `` The siege is over,'' he said. `` That price has been paid. Now the Lord has a different mission and a different way, and he wants to continue ... bringing forth this kingdom of God.'' `` I do think the Lord is going to use the courts, and a lot of stuff is going to come out,'' he said.

Oscar, manufactured by the R.S. <ORGANIZATION> Owens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, is made of <LOCATION> Britannia </LOCATION> metal, copper plate, nickel plate and gold plate. From 1942 to 1944, the trophy was made of plaster, but winners were later presented with the real thing. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, the only engraving mistake was in 1938 when the best actor trophy given to <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> for `` Boy's Town'' read: `` Best Actor: <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>.'' The Academy holds all the rights on the statue and `` reserves the right to buy back an Oscar before someone takes it to a pawn shop,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Werden </PERSON>. The most-nominated film was `` All About Eve'' in 1950. It got 14 nominations. `` Ben-Hur'' in 1959 was the most-awarded film with 11, and <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> was the most-awarded person with 32.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today he hopes to get support from <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> if <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> drops out of the Democratic presidential race as expected, while <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> set the stage for his withdrawal if he does n't `` win somewhere'' next week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who finished fourth, said he and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> discussed the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor's political future as voters were casting the ballots that left <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> in sixth place Tuesday night. `` He wanted to discuss what his options were, which he is still wrestling with with his wife <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` He's not made a final judgment.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> quickly added, `` I hope I get his support.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who finished third in the Democratic race behind <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, said the balloting next week would determine his political future. `` I have to win either in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and we have to get additional campaign contributions,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those two things have to be there, otherwise, I'm going to have to withdraw. ... You have to win somewhere.'' After <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses last week, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> withdrew from the Republican presidential race. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who also appeared on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> program, indicated today that he would like to continue his campaign, saying, `` I've devoted a year to talking to the American people.'' His wife, who joined him in the interview, added: `` I think we'll keep going with the message of this campaign.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said Tuesday it was premature for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> to be wooing his backers, saying he would spend a few days in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and `` call and talk to my supporters all over the country and ask them this question: ` How ... can we keep this reform movement alive?''' He had said prior to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary that the state's voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy Republican Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> got 13 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vote and voiced optimism today over his third-place showing behind Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` We're going to do well in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman added that `` people recognize we are viable, we are confident that we will be able to raise money.'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who got 10 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vote, found cause to cheer in that fourth-place showing just ahead of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in the five-man Republican race. `` Point is, we've all finished together,'' du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said of the trio on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s bottom rung. And on his prospects in the days ahead: `` We did much better in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> than we did in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. We'll do much better in the South than we did in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who finished with 9 percent, said the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> would be a welcome change after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, which was <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s neighborhood, and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, which was claimed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` Tomorrow morning, I go into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and they're going to be playing in my backyard.'' For the Democrats, though neither <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> got a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> boost to take <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, both were sure to find friendlier territory in Dixie. `` We've already been saving our resources for Super Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in an interview from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've spent more time here than other candidates.'' Both <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who happened upon <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s studio in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> as the votes rolled in Tuesday night, huddled with the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor to ask his support should he withdraw. `` Our message has tremendous overlap. ... I hope that in time we will work out some common ground in terms of our politics,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who finished with 8 percent, ahead of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s 7 percent, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s 5 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s 4 percent. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he expects to be a candidate `` as far ahead in the future as I can see.'' But he added, `` I understand that there are standards that have to be met in terms of delegates and votes,'' he said. `` It will take at least 30 to 60 days to determine if I can put together a viable candidacy.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, cheered by his second-place showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s primary, said today that voters will buy his ideas because `` this is not a candidacy, this is a cause.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> continued his campaign theme of change, as he left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which holds a primary next Tuesday. `` This is not a candidacy, this is a cause. And the cause is changing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ a new trade policy, a new agriculture and energy policy, inspiring and motivating our corporate leaders to stop the paper profits and to start looking at how we do the business of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> again to make good products,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said his showing in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential primary leaves him positioned `` to do great in the South.'' `` It appears to me that we've got a Dukakis-Gephardt race through the rest of the country,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said Tuesday night. Final but unofficial results gave <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 37 percent, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the congressman from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 20 percent and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 18 percent. At his campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> began a jubilant victory statement by saying, `` I love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' `` Everybody said the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign could n't do it in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' he told cheering supporters. `` Well, we said that this is one nation, one people ... and we proved that the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> are a part of this country and care about this country and about this cause.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> insisted that his campaign's finances were in good shape for the move south. He said loans to the campaign were made against federal matching funds, which he will receive later. `` It's a cash-flow situation,'' he said. `` We did n't borrow money that we did n't have coming. So we're in good shape. We're going to do fine for Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> pointed to a recent <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> poll that put him first in the South in front of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Asked whether <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s third-place showing would put him out of the race, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he did n't know. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has run a good campaign, he's a fine man and that's his decision,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had been concentrating their fire on each other until the weekend, when both switched to advertisements attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Demers </PERSON>, co-chairman of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign, noted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now has `` a gold -LRB- medal -RRB- and a bronze'' after his third-place <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> showing and Tuesday's victory. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> picked up the metaphor later, saying, `` I've got a gold and a silver.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he was especially happy to have won in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, which is the state's largest city. There he beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 29 percent to 27 percent. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> planned to leave the state early this morning for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where he will spend six of the seven days before the state's primary Feb. 23.

 Mayor <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> easily defeated his challenger in the Republican primary for City Hall, and will face a state senator in the April general election. `` We've been looking to get this out of the way so we can get to the main event,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said after his victory Tuesday night over businessman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 54, who waged a minimal primary campaign, won the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination with 14,952 votes, or 61 percent, according to unofficial results from all 188 precincts. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> received 38 percent of the vote, or 9,327 votes. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>'s opponent in the April 5 race is Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, who contended <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s relatively strong showing against an incumbent indicates voters are not pleased with <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> only recently joined the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to stop <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> from running unopposed, <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> also noted. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, a sign company president, had defeated <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> in the 1986 primary. `` It certainly would have to be a disappointment to Mr. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> to have Mr. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> run so well against him,'' <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> won the Democratic nomination with 57 percent of the ballots cast, or 20,507 votes.

 A fire broke out today in an unoccupied fifth-floor room of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, forcing about 150 people to flee the building to a snowstorm outside. Flames leaped from windows on the fifth floor of the aging, 10-story building, and smoke continued to pour out for an hour after it was evacuated. Soviet firefighters were summoned to the scene in midafternoon and were escorted by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guards into the embassy compound. The blaze apparently began in an unoccupied room in an area undergoing renovation. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a senior embassy spokesman, said the cause of the fire had not been determined. No injuries were reported. The building, leased to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the Soviet government since the 1950s, was to have been replaced by a new diplomatic complex. But the embassy building at the center of that complex remains vacant and unfinished following discovery that it was riddled with Soviet eavesdropping devices. About 150 embassy employees were in the building when the fire broke out. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> was not at the embassy at the time but returned after the evacuation, press attache <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said the fire `` might be construction related, but it has not been determined.'' The spokesman said there was no serious damage to the main working areas of the embassy, which are located on the sixth floor and above. Most of the 40 apartments once used by guards and diplomats have been vacated in recent months as officials have moved into the modern brick townhouses that surround the new embassy building. The diplomats and embassy workers were ordered out of their offices and stood on the sidewalk in a snowstorm to watch firemen combat the fire. The blaze occurred in a section of the building that had been used to house <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Seabees _ members of construction battalions _ and workers brought to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on temporary assignment. But a spokesman said the corner room where the fire broke out was not being occupied at the time. Much of the building, which is in poor repair, is under renovation while officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ponder what to do with their new embassy building less than a block away. A Soviet fire official said the blaze was confined to one room and that no injuries were reported. Embassy employees were told to take the rest of the day off because the building could not be occupied for at least several hours. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said embassy officials decided about 30 minutes after the blaze was discovered that they could n't contain it without assistance, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> fire trucks were called to the scene. Marine guards, who are responsible for security inside the compound, escorted the firemen and their vehicles into the courtyard of the pre-revolutionary mansion and accompanied the firefighters as they trained hoses on the blaze and entered the main embassy building with gas masks and extinguishers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, during an inspection of the embassy last April, pronounced it `` a firetrap and unsafe by accepted standards for general working conditions. A more serious fire ravaged the top floors of the embassy building in August 1977. Officials said afterward the damage was particularly severe because Ambassador <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Toon </PERSON> refused to permit Soviet firefighters to enter the top-security embassy communications center and some of its most sensitive work areas to combat the blaze. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a senior official said the fire was contained to an unclassified area and was unrelated to talks that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will open Sunday with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` The fire was a fire,'' said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>. `` It would be totally wrong, it would be fiction, to try to have it have anything to do with the upcoming visit.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will hold talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on arms control negotiations, human rights and a prospective withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. They also will make preparations for a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next spring between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, who is in charge of the European bureau at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and will accompany <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said the fire `` affected our communications somewhat'' with the embassy and that she did not have all the details. The embassy and its operations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have been the center of controversy for more than a year. A scandal exploded around accusations that Marine guards, influenced by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women with whom they were illicitly associating, had permitted Soviet agents inside secret areas of the embassy when no diplomats were present. Those charges were never proved, but a Marine was convicted in August of espionage. Officials disclosed in 1986 that the new $ 191 million embassy, already five years behind schedule, would not be finished or occupied until they decided whether it could be made secure from electronic bugs. Proposals include razing part or all of the new building or building a new structure in the complex to house communications facilities and secret operations.

 Narcotics agents mistakenly raided a minister's house after counting from the wrong end of the block, officials said. `` I thought they were robbers,'' said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, whose daughter, <PERSON> Noemi </PERSON>, woke him up early Sunday to say three men were in the backyard with crowbars and guns. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a minister at the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, says he asked the men what they wanted and they told him to stop or be shot. They then followed him into the house, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. `` When he -LRB- one of the officers -RRB- told me he was from the state police, I was relieved,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. `` But I was still frightened.'' His wife and two daughters sat in the living room while the men went through the house and out front, where they ran into the rest of the raiding party _ and learned of their mistake. Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> blames of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> division </ORGANIZATION> blames `` human error.'' The department had assigned men to two groups, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. One group was supposed to enter the targeted home from the front, and the other _ the group that raided the <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> home _ was supposed to guard the rear. Because the houses do n't have numbers on the back, the group in the rear was instructed to count houses from the corner, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The problem, he said, was that they started counting at the wrong end of the block. Later Sunday, public safety officers and the <ORGANIZATION> Abilene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> arrested seven people down the block.

 The Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says it will not comply with an order to name an essayist who claimed in a recent issue to have committed a mercy killing. A subpoena was served Tuesday by the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney's office regarding a Jan. 8 essay titled `` It's Over, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, general counsel for the nation's largest organization of Although the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> `` strongly condemns'' mercy killing, its journal will not comply with the subpoena, he said in a statement. `` Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>, the editor in chief of JAMA, has invoked the privilege protecting information obtained by reporters in the course of their work as provided in the Illinois Reporter's Privilege Act,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said The act says a person seeking privileged, or protected, information must apply in writing to the circuit court to set aside the protection, he said. The act also says the court may overrule the privilege only when, after a hearing, it finds all other sources have been exhausted and disclosure of the information `` is essential to protection of the public interest,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` Because the state's attorney's office has not complied with these requirements of the act, <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION> will not comply with the subpoena,'' the attorney said. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said Tuesday, `` We have no comment, and in fact, are not confirming we are even looking into this.'' In the article, a doctor described injecting a fatal dose of morphine into a terminally ill young woman he had never seen before who suffered from ovarian cancer. <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they did not verify the purported mercy killing but believe it was based on fact. They said the author requested anonymity. Handing over information would `` inhibit <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION> and other media from publishing information from sources who wish to remain anonymous,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s statement said. `` Thus, disclosure would strike at the heart of the Reporters Privilege Act and the First Amendment interests which it seeks to protect.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> and its journal are based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The essay did not indicate where the author lived or where the purported incident took place.

 `` The Last Emperor,'' <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s tragic saga of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s boy emperor, captured top honors today with nine nominations, including best picture, for the 60th Motion Picture Academy Awards. It was followed by seven nominations for `` Broadcast News,'' the romantic comedy of life in a network news bureau. Among the nominees were newcomer <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, cited in the best actress category for her portrayal of a frenetic producer. Following those two films, with six nominations each, were: `` Empire of Sun,'' the Japanese invasion of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as seen through a boy's eyes; `` Fatal Attraction,'' the chiller of a woman's revenge against a spurning lover, and `` Moonstruck,'' the comedy of love in a volatile Italian-American family. All four except <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s `` Empire of the Sun,'' were nominated as best picture. The fifth nominee was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON>'s `` Hope And Glory. And <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> once again was denied a director's nomination, as he was in 1983 for `` The Color Purple.'' `` I think it's extraordinary that a picture like this that's so completely English should get this kind of acclaim,'' <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> apartment. Two-time winner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> won his ninth nomination as the 1930s bum in `` Ironweed,'' and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was nominated for best actor with his role as the antic disc jockey in `` Good Morning Vietnam.''

His only previous film as director, `` Terms of Endearment,'' won him the award in 1983. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Film Festival and was told of the film's seven nominations by telephone. `` He was quite thrilled with seven nominations.

 The Academy has already announced one winner: <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> for the <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalberg </PERSON> award, presented for `` consistently high quality of motion picture production.'' The director-writer-producer of `` The Lost Weekend,'' `` <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>,'' `` Stalag 17,'' `` Some Like It Hot,'' `` The Apartment'' and other films has won six Oscars. With one exception, nominations for the Academy Awards are made by the individual branches: actors nominate for acting, directors for directing. All of the 4,400 voting members nominate the best picture of the year. The awards are voted by all members, with a few exceptions. For short subjects, documentaries and foreign-language films, voters must attend screenings or certify that they have seen the nominees. One category is missing this year: best original song score. The requirements are five original songs by one writer or team of writers for a single film, and no film qualified. After the announcements, publicists traditionally return to their offices to plot campaigns for their nominees, ncluding trade advertising, special screenings, media tours and promotional mailings to Academy voters. The awards will be televised by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> on April 11 from the Shrine Auditorium. Among the stars scheduled to appear onstage: <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Candy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Roy Cohn Autobiography Says Judge Decided Rosenberg Sentence in
Advance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The late <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> says in his autobiography that the judge in the famous <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> spy case decided before the trial that he would put <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> to death. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> was a member of the prosecution team. Excerpts from his yet-to-be published autobiography, written with journalist <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Zion </PERSON>, were published Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, who was 24 at the time of the 1951 spy trial, also asserted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> telephoned him during the trial to seek his advice on a penalty for <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said he recommended the death penalty. The <PERSON> Rosenbergs </PERSON> were convicted of selling atomic secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and were executed in 1953. A law clerk for <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, who is still on the bench, said, `` The judge is not available, and it's the policy of the chambers not to comment on press reports.'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, who became chief counsel to Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> during the `` Red scare'' hearings of the 1950s, died of heart failure and AIDS-related illnesses in August 1986. During a stormy career that included bitter run-ins with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and many public figures, <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>'s veracity was frequently challenged. In the book, <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> recalled that <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said he sought divine guidance before deciding on the <ORGANIZATION> Rosenbergs </ORGANIZATION>' sentences. `` I ca n't confirm or deny this. So far as I know, the closest he got to prayer was the phone booth next to the Park Avenue Synagogue. He called from that booth to a phone behind the bench in the courtroom, to ask my advice on whether he ought to give the death penalty to <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>. ... There was never any question about <PERSON> Julius </PERSON>: <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> had told me before the trial started that he was going to sentence <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> to death.'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> was concerned about public reaction to a woman being executed. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> `` that she's worse than <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> ... so unless you're willing to say that a woman is immune from the death penalty, I do n't see how you can justify sparing her.''

 A mysterious blast ripped through the side of a Japanese auto carrier in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> today, but divers later determined that the ship had only ran aground, salvage executives said. Salvage tugboats with divers aboard had rushed to help the 4,842-ton ton motor vehicle carrier Prosper World after the explosion was reported. When asked about damage, the captain reported that a tank was leaking, said the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The captain was identified as a Korean. After the divers went into action, monitors heard them telling the captain by radio that `` he had just ran aground, and the whole bottom plate -LRB- of the vessel -RRB- was wrinkled.'' They also told him he had a 15-by-9-inch hole in the keel which they could patch up, but he needed to head to a dry dock for repairs. The vessel flies the Liberian flag and is operated by the Hyogo-based <ORGANIZATION> Masumoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, they said.

 A passenger's throat was slashed by another traveler on a flight from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, authorities said. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>, 35, was in critical condition today at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a hospital spokewoman said. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> was sitting near the rear of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 when a man attacked him Tuesday with a pocketknife, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said. Passengers are allowed to carry pocketknives with blades of less than 4 inches. `` There really was not any sort of struggle, and not many passengers were involved,'' Ms. <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said. Authorities said they did not know the motive for the attack. A doctor on the flight, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortus </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION>, used his hand to stanch the bleeding and held an oxygen mask over the victim's face, officials said. `` He was already slipping out of consciousness, and he was bleeding very heavily from his neck,'' <PERSON> Fortus </PERSON> said. `` He probably would have died in a couple of minutes if we did n't stop the bleeding.'' The jet, carrying 143 passengers and 23 crew members, was flying over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, was stabbed. The flight received landing priority, and touched down at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> about 45 minutes later, officials said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was arrested when the plane landed.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said today that the South is `` a different ball game'' as he seeks to regain momentum after finishing last in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s leadoff Republican presidential primary. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, played down the controversy over his statement Sunday that the Soviets had placed nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` I was not hurt by more than 400 or 500 votes,'' he said. He said his biggest problem in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was organization. `` I'm not an issues person, I'm an organizational person,'' he said. But he said the South was `` a different ball game.'' `` We're going to have the finances and the people to do the job down there,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> finished a surprising second in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses Feb. 8, behind <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and ahead of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

Aide <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had a larger base to work from in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, partly because the religious program he was formerly with, 700 Club, had a wider viewership there. But the South will be a different story, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told several hundred cheering supporters. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had claimed <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> as his backyard, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said the same of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, `` they're going to be playing in my backyard,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I'm throwing the gauntlet down to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is the first Super Tuesday state, and I'm going to beat you there convincingly,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said to cheering, stomping and chants of `` We want Pat!''

 Detectives today questioned a woman charged with fatally shooting a caseworker in a hospital emergency room while waiting for psychiatric help, authorities said. <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 31, briefly held three people hostage after the shooting Tuesday night before she surrendered, police said. Detective <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said today authorities had three addresses for her _ <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braddock </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION>. She was arraigned early today on a charge of criminal homicide, but will not enter a plea until a preliminary hearing, yet to be scheduled. Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the hostages were being questioned by homicide detectives this morning. `` She came seeking psychiatric help,'' police Cmdr. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said. `` The hospital caseworker was helping her at the time. For some reason, she pulled out a gun and started shooting.'' Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> apparently was sitting with hospital caseworker <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, in the psychiatric waiting area of the emergency room at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> when she pulled out a gun, he said. Miss <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> was shot in the back as she turned to flee, he said. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> then ran into a bathroom within the glass-enclosed waiting room and, holding the door ajar, pointed a handgun at an unidentified man and two women who were waiting for a relative. `` They just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' he said. `` Everyone else in the emergency room was evacuated,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON> said. Paramedics heard the shots and radioed for police, said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizza </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Police talked with Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who allowed them to remove the wounded caseworker, said Police Chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> died before getting treatment, he said. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> asked to speak to Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, with whom she went to high school. When he arrived, Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> released one hostage, he said. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said she then asked to talk to <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, operations manager and a talk show host on WPTT-TV. When <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> arrived, the woman freed the remaining hostages and then asked for cigarettes, he said. White slid the cigarettes across the floor. As she reached down to pick up the pack, White's partner, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Conova </PERSON>, slammed the bathroom door closed and shoved a row of chairs up against the door, said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>. Police held a bulletproof shield against the door, and minutes later another detective persuaded Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to surrender, police said.

 Rebels bombed a high school theater during a performance marking the anniversary of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s independence, killing 11 students and a villager and wounding 133 people, a newspaper said today. The state-run Working Peoples' Daily said five students were killed instantly when the time bomb, put under a seat, exploded last Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Momouk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Momouk </LOCATION>. The school is in <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> state, about 500 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Six other students and a villager later died at a hospital, the report said. It said most of the wounded were students. The attack was blamed on <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> rebels. A number of groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Kachin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, have been fighting the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> government for greater autonomy. The Kachins are the strongest anti-government group after the communists. The high school bombing occurred on Union Day, which commemorates the Feb. 12, 1947 signing of an agreement by various Burmese national groups to jointly receive independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Five days before the attack, 17 people were wounded in an explosion at an open-air theater where a show marking Union Day festivities was under way, the paper said. That blast occurred in <LOCATION> Shan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, 380 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Military officers who took journalists and foreign diplomats on a tour of <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> state last month alleged that rebels not only bombed railway lines and public buildings but also private homes and places where festivities are held. Government forces last year were reported to have overrun two <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> strongholds near the Chinese border after a series of battles.

 <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds gusting to 60 mph whipped across <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, overturning small planes and tractor trailers, closing a freeway and fanning fires. One man was electrocuted when he stepped on a power line. `` The stoplights are swaying,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donadee </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> resident. `` I've never seen them sway before ... There's a lot of debris that's blowing very, very fast in the streets.'' <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Azusa </LOCATION> was killed as he stepped on a live wire, apparently downed by the wind, while helping to douse a fire on a neighbor's lawn, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Detta </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` We've got a lot of problems.

Two planes were reported overturned at <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, and two more were tossed about at Van Nuys Airport, officials said. Ten miles of the Foothill Freeway between <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> were closed at 4:30 a.m. when fierce gusts made driving dangerous, said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Officer <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said today that he made a mistake in not responding to charges from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the closing hours of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary campaign, but aides promised <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would react `` very, very forcefully'' to future attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader, looking to recover from a big loss in the Granite State Tuesday, vowed to correct what he said are the lies in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign ads. `` I'm going to try to go out and straighten it out. I'm not going to run from it. I'm not known for running from a fight,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> airport before flying to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I never said I was going to raise your taxes. I did n't say I was advocating a $ 10-a-barrel import fee. But that's what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ads say and they are not true.'' Flying back to take part in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on campaign financing, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was asked if he had been too soft on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Probably,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters on the plane. And queried on whether he should have not let <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges go unanswered, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` Yes, that's my guess.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> that he thought he had done well to finish second against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a state the vice president says is his neighbor. But he said the boost he got out of his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> victory on Feb. 8 was overrated. `` I think our expectations got out of hand,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` I think we sat on our hands for three days.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> brushed aside suggestions that he would now return to the style of the `` mean old <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'' saying the nation is seeing a `` mean <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` They've got the axes and they seem to be swinging them in every state,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign manager, underscored the new forcefulness the campaign plans against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks. `` When he does it from now on, we're going to respond very, very forcefully,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said on the plane. `` We're tired of it. We're sick to the gills of this type of tactic. But <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said the campaign would not respond `` in kind, negative against negative.'' `` We're not going to play their game. We're not going to put up with the effort to distort the record,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> told reporters. `` We do n't have to wallow in the mud with them to answer their charges. ... When they are wrong, we are going to point it out.'' Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convincing victory Tuesday night blunted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s post-Iowa momentum, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and his aides forced a positive face on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> results But the frustration was apparent when <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were interviewed from different locations by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wished <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> well as the campaigns moved south, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> made his sharp comment, referring to last-day television ads by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign that claimed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> supports tax increases and Social Security cuts. `` You should n't distort someone's record,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` I could do that to him, but I wo n't.'' He vowed to `` straighten out my record. It wo n't take long.'' `` For the campaign of a sitting <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president to engage in the kind of base distortions of this weekend is demeaning to that office and demeaning to our party,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, a key <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> backer. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s own big win in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last week had helped boost his standing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> polls. Once 20 points behind, he pulled even a few days before the voting. But the drive faltered, and Tuesday nights results left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader at 29 percent, nine points behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was still 16 points ahead of the next <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contender, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and his aides insisted Tuesday night that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory was nothing to crow about. `` Obviously we would have liked to have won here,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` We did n't quite do that, but we did a lot.'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said: `` We were down more than 20 points eight days ago, and to have come this close _ that is a tremendous commentary on <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. It's also a commentary on the softness of the vice president's supporters.'' But he also indicated that the tone of the campaign is likely to change, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` 21 days to start telling the truth and dealing with issues, and we're going to give him a countdown, day by day.''

<HEAD>State's Top Court Strikes Down Anti-Loitering Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state law forbidding loitering in subway, train or bus stations is unconstitutional because it puts people too much at the mercy of police, the state's top court ruled today. The law forbids people from sleeping in transportation facilities or staying there without giving authorities a `` satisfactory explanation'' of what they're doing. In a decision written by Judge <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Titone </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said the statute failed to give a `` person of ordinary intelligence'' notice that his conduct is against the law. `` Such a generalized law fails to distinguish between conduct calculated to cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent, thereby failing to give adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited,'' <PERSON> Titone </PERSON> wrote in the 7-0 ruling. The court ruled unanimously in favor of two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> men who were arrested in 1985 for loitering in incidents at <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON> was arrested after showing an open satchel to passersby at <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. When Bright failed to produce identification to a policeman, he was told he was being arrested for loitering. He was also charged with possessing stolen credit cards, according to court records. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was arrested at the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> after he failed to give police an explanation of what he was doing there. An officer searching <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> had found cocaine and a pipe in his jacket. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s office argued that the requirement that police give a `` satisfactory explanation'' why the conduct is illegal was enough to make the law stand. But the court said the law leaves it up to the police officer to decide whether an explanation is satisfactory. That, <PERSON> Vitone </PERSON> wrote, makes the law unconstitutional. Requiring a person to explain his actions also violates a person's right to remain silent when questioned by police, the court said. `` He is faced with the choice of either foregoing his constitutional right to remain silent in the hope that his explanation will satisfy that particular law enforcement official, or invoking his constitutional right to remain silent and being arrested,'' <PERSON> Vitone </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, who argued the case for the district attorney's office, said she would withhold comment until she has a chance to read the ruling An anti-loitering law was first enacted by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1939. The law then noted that subways and railroad stations had become attractive for `` fakers, perverts, pickpockets, loiterers, sleepers, flimflam men, etc. who infested these properties night and day.'' After being amended in 1953, the law was passed in its current form in 1965.

 East German newspapers today printed pictures of dismantled missiles and hailed Soviet preparations for removing SS-12 nuclear missiles before a superpower treaty scrapping intermediate-range weapons is ratified. `` In the name of reason. A historic moment awaits,'' said a banner headline in the <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Young World -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s youth newspaper. `` Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-. Troops in Waren dismantle medium-range rockets earlier than expected,'' Neues Deutschland -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- said in a headline. <PERSON> Waren </PERSON> is 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> and about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Removal of missile troops ... starts earlier than expected. Transfer to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and destruction of their type SS-12 armaments in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Berliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s main opposition party, the Social Democrats, called on the West German government to follow <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s lead in getting rid of nuclear weapons early. The party's disarmament expert in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> today that Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government should respond with early scrapping <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 72 Pershing 1A missiles <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday night that missiles in Waren had been taken apart, put in crates and were ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` With this step we can make an important contribution toward disarmament even before the treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ratified,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, agreeing to eliminate all land-based, medium - and shorter-range missiles The agreement stipulates that the Soviets' shorter-range missiles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are to be removed within 18 months and medium-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles within three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not ratified the treaty. The Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s parliament, is expected to approve the accord. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate reaction to the report. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, however, said the Soviets were free to take down their missiles before the treaty takes effect. The official, who demanded anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will go to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the Soviets were complying with the treaty, if it is ratified. Although there was no comment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the reported dismantling, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday criticized Western European countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower treaty. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as criticizing Western European governments for `` the latest wave of praise for the ` nuclear deterrence' strategy ... all manner of projects for the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the Franco-West German military rapprochement, and so forth.'' West German government officials declined comment on the report Tuesday night. `` It is too early for us to comment at this time,'' a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when they would be returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, only that Soviet soldiers `` are making the last preparations to return their SS-12 rockets.'' The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the intermediate-range missile treaty, which bans weapons with a range of 300 miles to 3,000 miles. East German television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading missile crates onto transport vehicles. ADN quoted a Soviet military officer as saying the `` troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit.'' The rockets are to be sent back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by train, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. It said East German journalists who toured the missile base were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the East German leader, indicated in January that Soviet intermediate-range rockets stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be removed ahead of schedule, but he gave no specific timetable. According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice missiles were stationed at the <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> site, which holds the largest numbers of SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There are three other SS-12 rocket sites in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In all, there are 54 SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, according to those figures. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also has 53 SS-23 shorter-range nuclear rockets in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Savary </PERSON>, the education minister whose policies sent millions protesting in the streets and threatened to bring down the government, has died, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced today. He was 69. According to the statement, <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> had been hospitalized for several weeks with a serious infection. It did not say when he died or state the cause of death. A member of the French Resistance during World War II, <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> had a reputation for being soft-spoken but stubborn. He was one of the leaders of the post-Liberation French government, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and first held ministerial positions under President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>. As education minister, <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> proposed a bill in 1984 that attempted to institute President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s campaign promise to revamp the nation's private education system. Among other things, the reform bill gave local authorities more control over management and financing of private schools, where nearly 16 percent of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 12 million children are educated. The Savary Law inflamed passions for months. Opponents felt it threatened the basic right to choose how to educate their children. Supporters wished to hold <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to his election promise of creating `` a unified, secular public education service.'' A daylong demonstration against the bill drew at least 1.5 million people to the capital on June 24, 1984. Organizers compared the crowds to those that thronged the Champs Elysee in 1968 after student riots and in 1944 after the liberation of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON>, the premier at the time of the Savary Law controversy, said the reforms had been `` totally misunderstood,'' but the Socialists, who long opposed private schools, withdrew the bill. The controversy caused a government reshuffle in which <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> resigned. He was replaced by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenment </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON> was replaced by <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabius </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, expressed his `` very sincere condolences'' to the family and friends of <PERSON> Savary </PERSON>, who served as education minister from 1981 until 1984. `` Courageous, lucid, discrete, <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> put loyalty and honor behind his convictions. He will remain one of the great names of Socialism,'' said <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> was party secretary from 1969 to 1971 and `` was one of the moving forces behind the -LRB- party's -RRB- renaissance,'' <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON> said. `` He represented Socialism, with his strong sense of morality, his sense of justice and his commitment to the decolonization'' of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON> said. Born April 25, 1918, in the French colony of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> was a strong advocate of decolonization. He served as secretary of state for Moroccan and <LOCATION> Tunisian </LOCATION> affairs in 1956, but quit to protest French actions during the French-Algerian War.

 Three Soviet technicians will take a look at the town of <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION> to get a general feeling for the community where their countrymen could be stationed if the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty is ratified. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, a spokesman for Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had confirmed the Soviet team was expected in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> today for a two-day review. An American contingent was to conduct a similar tour in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said the Soviet technicians planned to tour Magna, about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, this afternoon. He said specific details were not available. Magna, population 8,500, is a few miles from the Hercules Bacchus West plant. Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a compound near the plant if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratifies the INF treaty, signed Dec. 7 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The treaty would eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weaponry in both countries' arsenals. The countries' inspection teams could be in place within 60 days of the treaty's ratifications, officials say. The Soviets would monitor Hercules, which developed motors for the Pershing II missiles, banned under the treaty, from 1979 to 1987. The Soviet technicians will be accompanied by four members of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. Today, the Soviets will make a `` very general visit to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. It will just be the town, the stores, just to get a feeling for the area,'' he said. On Thursday, the three technicians will conduct a similar tour of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and then leave Friday, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. He said no news conferences or statements were planned. The Soviet and American advance teams will meet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a week after the tours to discuss housing, travel and other arrangements, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s office said. Pershing II missile motors no longer are built at <LOCATION> Hercules </LOCATION>, but the company has a contract for third-stage motors for the intercontinental MX missile.

 The state parole board today ordered convicted rapist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, who was freed by the governor when his accuser recanted in 1985, to return to prison for at least six months for violating his parole. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it had declared <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> a parole violator for failing to report to his parole officer on Dec. 24. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was convicted of rape in 1979. In 1985, <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> homemaker, recanted her testimony that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> had raped her when she was a teen-ager. After three days of hearings in 1985, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> commuted <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s 25 - to 50-year sentence to time served The governor did not pardon <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, saying he did not believe the recantation. After several subsequent brushes with the law, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was again threatened with prison. Today's decision involved <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s failure to check in with a parole officer and a confrontation he had at a suburban bar. The board ordered <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> held in state prison until Aug. 16, when he will be eligible for parole again, said <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. During the six months he is in prison, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was ordered by the board to join a substance-abuse program. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> told the board during a hearing Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Joliet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that he is an alcoholic and needed treatment. `` He's going to remain in prison for six months and then he'd be transferred into some sort of a community-based rehabilitation program at that time -LRB- Aug. 16 -RRB- as a condition of his parole,'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said today by telephone from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. At Tuesday's hearing, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, 30, said, `` I plan on seeking full-time treatment.'' Earlier last year, he was convicted on drunken driving charges, and was later returned to prison for violating terms of parole after that conviction. He was paroled Christmas Eve in what <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> called a `` last-chance'' deal. But <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> failed to check in with his parole officer and, two days later, was involved in a confrontation at a bar that landed him back behind bars. Prosecutors have dropped battery charges against <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> in the incident in which, officials said, he had argued with bar employees over a sandwich and stabbed a cook in the hand.

<HEAD>Court Sees Right to Order Sterilization, Won't Spell Out
Guidelines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today said lower courts may authorize sterilization of mentally retarded people but refused to spell out guidelines under which the procedure is appropriate. In a narrowly drawn opinion, the justices agreed that courts can act on a request that mentally retarded people be sterilized even though a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977. `` We conclude that our district courts possess subject matter jurisdiction over, and accordingly may hear and determine, applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentally incapacitated ward,'' the high court said. A stinging dissent said the court was wandering into a subject `` shot through with searching social and ethical questions.'' `` In taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself to the eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendant social and ethical issues,'' said Justice <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` Future litigants, faced with unanswered questions of great social and ethical dimensions, or with missing ingredients of a vague application process, will continue to press us for determinations we are singularly unfit to reach.'' But the majority rejected that reasoning. `` Stated another way, we do not believe our courts lack jurisdiction over a case merely because the case is important or unavoidably includes a constitutional dimension,'' the court said. The 7-1 decision came in a <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> case in which Jan and <PERSON> Tekla </PERSON> <PERSON> Matejski </PERSON> are the legal guardians of their 33-year-old mentally retarded daughter, court records said. The couple filed an application with a lower court seeking authorization to have their daughter sterilized, but a lawyer appointed by the court to guard the woman's rights objected, claiming there's no provision in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> law allowing sterilization. <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pille </PERSON> agreed and dismissed the application. Both sides appealed, arguing over whether courts have the power to order sterilization, but going one step further and asking the high court to set groundrules. Lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> repealed a law providing for sterilization of people `` who are mentally ill or retarded, syphilitic, habitual criminals, moral degenerates, or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society.'' But while agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests, the high court refused to spell out guidelines. `` We are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given the posture of the present case,'' the court said. `` The excursion suggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisory opinion.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the decision would haunt the justices. `` At what level of mental retardation can sterilization be compelled?'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> asked. `` What board or body, if any, will suggest statewide standards?

 Nine-year-old <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, smiling and carrying a new musical keyboard under his arm, walked out of the hospital today, more than a month after he fell into a pond and was trapped 40 minutes under the ice. `` He's a normal kid and he's going to go back to doing the normal things,'' Dr. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference. `` We're all humbled as caretakers to see what many of us would consider _ if not miraculous _ a near-miraculous recovery,'' added <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tecklenburg </PERSON>, another of <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>'s attending physicians at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, who lives in <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, is one of about five children in the medical literature to have recovered after having been under water for more than 30 minutes. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, wearing black jeans with suspenders, a blue striped shirt and a white hat, was asked how he felt. `` Good,'' he said and smiled shyly. He said he knew he would have to go back to school but said he was n't quite ready for that. In addition to the keyboard, donated by a electronics store, <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> also received a bicycle from a store. Ms. Powers said <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> might need more therapy to build his strength and endurance and might start back at school on a half-day schedule. <PERSON> Tecklenburg </PERSON> added <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> tested at his age level on standardized tests administered about 10 days ago. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> and two other children were playing on the frozen surface of a pond Jan. 12 when the ice gave way. His companions were rescued quickly but it was almost 40 minutes before rescuers pulled <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> out with grappling hooks. Doctors have said the time he spent under the water is as long as has been recored for anyone who has survived a near-drowning. In icy water, the body's metabolism slows and the brain does n't need as much oxygen. The reflex is particularly powerful in children, doctors say. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> was in a coma for two weeks, but, when he regained consciousness, made dramatic improvement.

 Many firefighters and other rescue workers deserve commendations for their `` heroic behavior'' during <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s worst subway fire, the chairman of a public inquiry into the fatal blaze said Wednesday.

 About 1,500 construction workers marched through this Slovenian capital Wednesday chanting `` We want bread!'' and `` Down with bureaucracy!'' to protest low pay and falling living standards, witnesses said. The workers of the Grosuplje building enterprise stopped work on Tuesday to demand a 50 percent wage hike and better quality of food in their canteen, the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. On Tuesday and Wednesday they marched to the republic's assembly building, carrying <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Slovenian and <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> flags, a witness told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, faced with its worst-ever economic and social crisis, was hit last year by an unprecedented 1,570 strikes involving more than 365,000 workers. Most of the strikes have been confined to factory premises, but the Grosuplje strike marks the third major instance in three months of worker dissatisfaction in the streets. On Nov. 17, about 5,000 steelworkers in <LOCATION> Skoplje </LOCATION>, the capital of the southern Republic of <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>, protested low pay. On Dec. 10, some 1,500 workers of a machine-tool factory in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> also marched to protest low wages. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said an average January salary at the Grosuplje enterprise amounted to the equivalent of $ 280.

 Leaders of white supremacist groups discussed poisoning the water of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to undermine the government, a prosecutor said today in his opening statement at the trial of 14 supremacists. Authorities contend the defendants sought to establish an Aryan nation, and robbed, bombed, killed, counterfeited and committed other crimes from July 1983 to April 1985 to reach their goal. Ten defendants are accused of conspiracy to overthrow the government by force. Five are accused of a conspiracy to kill a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and two are accused of transporting across state lines money stolen from an armored truck in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1984. The defendants have been identified by the government as members of right-wing racist groups, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and The Order. In his opening argument in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> told the all-white jury that the poisoning scheme was discussed by defendants <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> on one occasion in 1983, and <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> on another. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> had about 200 pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession at that time, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. Miles, 63, of <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, are considered two of the top three supremacist leaders. The third, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, also is on trial. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> told the jury that <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, in a speech at a 1983 white supremacist gathering, called for war against the government and said, `` If you do n't help me kill them ..., you're going to have to beg for your own child's life and the answer will be ` no.''' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> made a speech urging the use of robberies to finance supremacist activities. Over the next 18 months six robberies by supremacists netted more than $ 4 million, the prosecutor said. The library at <ORGANIZATION> Butler </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- contained books with titles like these, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said: `` How To Kill Vols. 1-6,'' `` Unconventional War,'' `` The Anarchist's Handbook. Several of the defendants are serving prison sentences and are representing themselves, although they also have court-appointed attorneys. During selection of 12 jurors and six alternates Tuesday, the three blacks among the 64 potential jurors were eliminated through the use of peremptory challenges, in which lawyers can strike a limited number of people from the panel without showing cause. The judge declined a defense attorney's request Tuesday to ask black prospective jurors whether they would be fair to defendants who believe in separation of the races and in white supremacy. <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> is a former grand dragon of the Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> authorities said <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> led a campaign of violent intimidation of Vietnamese fishermen in the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> area. In a letter obtained by government agents <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was under the control of a Zionist Occupation Government. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> leads a church that has attracted some white supremacists, including some who formed The Order, whose members turned to violence to bring about the downfall of the national government, say government investigators. Miles is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> the Savior at <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>. A former grand dragon of the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> was convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school buses in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, then under a court order to desegregate its schools. Besides those three, others charged with conspiracy are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, Ark.; and six men already in prison: <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, 48; <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> Ardie </PERSON> <PERSON> McBrearty </PERSON>, 59; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scutari </PERSON>, 39; <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnhill </PERSON>, 30; and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, 56. <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> received a death sentence for the 1983 murder of a <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, pawn shop operator and life in prison without parole for the 1984 murder of an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> state police trooper. <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> and four others were also charged with conspiring to murder a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. The other four were <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, 68, and his son, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, 34, both of <LOCATION> Smithville </LOCATION>, Ark.; <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 36, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, 24, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also were charged with attempting to murder the judge and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> were convicted in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> last year of civil rights charges stemming from the slaying of Jewish radio talk show host <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. Conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $ 20,000 fine. Interfering with a federally protected right resulting in death carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, as do the charges of conspiracy to murder or attempt to murder federal officials.

The ad, which ran last week in two newspapers and in three TV program guides, was meant to emphasize the short distances between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s cities and other tourist sites, <PERSON> Kooistra </PERSON> said. `` The distance between <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>?

<HEAD>Judge Reprimands Attorney for Comparing Demjanjuk Case to Dreyfus
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge in the Nazi war crimes trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> today reprimanded a defense attorney for comparing the proceedings to the Dreyfus case, in which a Jewish officer in the French army was falsely convicted of treason. Presiding Judge <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> ordered defense attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> to retract the statement and said, `` No court in the world would allow such unfair claims to be made.'' <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> refused repeatedly, but when <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> threatened to cite him for contempt of court, both sides agreed to take the issue up at Thursday's session. <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> told the court during closing arguments that `` Capt. -LRB- <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> was convicted at the beginning of the century on the basis of false documents in a wave of anti-Semitism. Paralleling this with anti-Ukrainianism, this trial has all the earmarks of the Dreyfus trial.'' The Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is accused of being `` Ivan the Terrible,'' a sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 67, a retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker, claims he is a victim of mistaken identity. He says he served in the Soviet army, was captured by the Germans in 1941 and remained in prisoner of war camps until 1943. Earlier, <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> alleged that the Soviet secret police forged a key piece of prosecution evidence as part of an elaborate conspiracy to discredit the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court and create a rift between Ukrainians and Jews in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> forged the document _ <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s alleged Nazi identity card _ so it could accuse the court of injustice if <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> were convicted. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> responded sharply, calling the theory `` distasteful.'' The Soviet-supplied document is the so-called <LOCATION> Trawniki </LOCATION> card. The prosecution alleged it was issued to <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Trawniki </LOCATION>, a Nazi training camp for death camp guards near <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> also sought to discredit prosecution witness <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, one of several experts who testified to the authenticity of the card. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an anthropologist, authenticated <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s picture on the <LOCATION> Trawniki </LOCATION> card by superimposing it on video footage of the defendant taken two years ago. <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> called Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s method an `` unexplored field'' and said it was not accepted by the scientific community. The defense is to wrap up its case Thursday, and a verdict from the three-judge panel is expected by April. If convicted, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> could face the death penalty.

<TEXT>
 A federal court jury began deliberations today on whether six men and two women are members of the Westies, a gang of thugs that allegedly terrorized <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Westside for two decades. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> turned the case over to the jury following last-minute instructions on how to conduct their deliberations. The trial began last October. A 17-count racketeering indictment charged the eight defendants were members of a criminal enterprise that seized control of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> neighborhood once known as <PERSON> Hell </PERSON>'s Kitchen 20 years ago and held sway there through a series of murders and other crimes. Among the crimes allegedly committed to further the Westies's goals were eight murders, three attempted murders and five murder plots, according to the indictment The indictment also listed 10 alleged co-conspirators who had been killed before the charges were brought in March. Prosecutors <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> claimed the Westies had dismembered some victims' bodies to enhance their reputation and eliminate competitors. The government also claimed the Westies forged an alliance with the Gambino organized crime family, said to be the nation's most powerful, and even shot a labor leader as a favor to reputed Gambino boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>. But lawyers for reputed Westies boss <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> and his seven co-defendants have denied the existence of the Westies as an organization. Even government witnesses have conceded the name Westies was created by the police and news media to describe a group of mainly Irish-American hoodlums. The defense also attacked the credibility of those prosecution witnesses, admitted former gang members who turned informants in a bid for leniency. <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shargel </PERSON>, claimed all were unreliable because they were criminals seeking to cut a deal with the government.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today pointed their campaigns southward after decisive <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> victories, and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> promised to counterattack unless the vice president stops `` distorting the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> record.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied he had done anything wrong. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who finished second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said he was in the race to stay. However, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, third among Democrats in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> after finishing second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said he will have to drop out unless he can win next week in either <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he had `` a divided mind'' about whether to continue but that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had already asked for his support if he should drop out. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the big Republican winner in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last week, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comeback victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was at least partly due to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> TV commercials that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said distorted his record `` I'm going to try to go out and straighten it out,'' he said at the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, airport before flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I'm not going to run from it. I'm not known for running from a fight.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday night, was reluctant to talk about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s accusation. However, when questioned during a brief exchange with reporters today, he replied, `` I think I said it was n't true, but I'll be glad to say that.'' `` You all want me to talk about Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. I want to talk about the issues,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to dwell on it, you see, I do n't want to be drawn into something like that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` People in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> like clean campaigns, and they endorsed me overwhelmingly.'' Tuesday night, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` lying about my record.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked about that in an interview taped for <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> today, said, `` I'm sorry he feels that way.'' Were you lying? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked. `` No,'' he answered quietly. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won 38 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vote _ and 11 delegates to the GOP convention _ in complete returns. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 29 percent of the vote and seven delegates. They were followed by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lived up to expectations by carrying his neighboring state by 16 percentage points over Rep. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, last week's winner in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The turnout was a record _ 154,012 Republican voters and 119,041 Democrats for a total of 273,053 compared with 261,243 in 1980. This year's figure was estimated to represent a bit less than half the state's registered voters. In other comments today: _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who won by a big margin in a state bordering <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> where he is the governor, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> that he can also do well in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, which dominates the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8 `` People in the South are n't voting for a ZIP code; they're voting for the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. _ <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> he would have to win next week, `` otherwise, I'm going to have to withdraw ... You just ca n't continue to run second and third. _ <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that whoever remains in the race, he himself will `` do well because we're connecting with the voters on my ideas. _ Rep <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who beat out former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> for third place among the Republicans, said his showing proved his standing among the conservatives who form the base for himself, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, on the other hand, said, `` This was a small spread between <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and me. He added, `` New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is not my natural constituency. ... Going into the South, it's a different ball game.'' `` On to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where we're going to rise again,'' exclaimed a euphoric <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> late Tuesday night. He won a solid victory after seeing his earlier 20-point lead in the polls melt in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> after his embarrassing third-place finish in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. For all the attention they got, Granite State voters managed to keep the presidential races in both parties in turmoil, offering just enough support to also-rans to give them an excuse to struggle on toward Super Tuesday, with its enormous 20-state risks and rewards. Among the Republicans, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> finished third with 13 percent, and three delegates. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> edged out <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 10 percent to 9 percent. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s total was high enough to win two delegates; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> got none. In the delegate totals, after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 61 came <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> with 42, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> with 35 and du Pont with two. The winning Republican needs 1,139 delegates. Among the Democrats, after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with 36 percent of the vote and nine delegates, came <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> with 20 percent and six delegates and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with 17 percent and three delegates. The other Democratic finishers _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 8 percent, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr. 7 percent, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> 5 percent and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> 4 percent _ did n't do well enough to pick up any delegates. In the delegate totals, after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 44.5 came <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> with 39 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with 33. The victorious Democrat needs 2,082 delegates for the nomination. Though he got no delegates, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was `` happy because in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> we proved we could broaden our base.'' Asked how he expected to do in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, he said, `` I expect to win.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was exultant at his showing. Quoting <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, he said, `` Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> belittled <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s regional strategy. `` Tomorrow, we head South,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. `` I do n't have a Southern strategy,'' he said. `` I do n't have a Northern strategy or a Western strategy. I have an American strategy.'' Six states will vote before Super Tuesday, but it was clear Tuesday night that the campaigns were looking ahead to March 8 when 20 states on the Democratic side and 16 on the Republican will offer the biggest one-day delegate prize of the campaign. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> take the spotlight next. Republicans and Democrats hold caucuses in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and primaries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> next Tuesday. In the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, fighting for Democratic runner-up, were also in a battle for money. Both campaigns are in financial trouble and needed a second-place finish to keep contributions coming in. With a first in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and a second in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was able to claim, `` I'm in good shape.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Republican primary is Saturday, March 5, three days before Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who passed up <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and spent less time than his rivals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, watched the returns from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he said `` Super Tuesday changes all the rules. It's a completely new ballgame.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he will take `` nothing for granted'' as turns his attention to the South after his victory over chief rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Republican presidential primary <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, thanking campaign workers at his national headquarters here, also denied that he had distorted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record in the waning days of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign _ as <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had charged Tuesday night. `` I think I said it was n't true, but I'll be glad to say that,'' he told reporters. After spending today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heads Thursday to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, three states among 20 that are holding presidential contests on Super Tuesday, March 8. The vice president's strong <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> showing Tuesday followed his third place finish in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today steadfastly refused to discuss <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s charge that the vice president had made false statements about the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator's record on such issues as the budget deficit and taxes `` You all want me to talk about Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. I want to talk about the issues,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You want to talk about history. I want to talk about the future. ... `` I'm not going to dwell on it, you see, I do n't want to be drawn into something like that,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` People in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> like clean campaigns, and they endorsed me overwhelmingly.'' `` The system worked. You can take them in the chin, you can get up and you can fight again,'' he said. `` So now, go on to Super Tuesday. We're going to fight hard. We're going to take nothing for granted. We're going to take a positive message _ a message that was good in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and is just as good -LRB- elsewhere -RRB-.'' `` We're moving into a new dimension now,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national campaign manager. `` The next big contest is Super Tuesday. Seventy percent of the delegates you need to get the nomination are going to be chosen that one night.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said that whoever walks out of the Super Tuesday contests with the lion's share of the delegates will win the Republican nomination. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has got a 3-1 lead on delegates now,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` He's going to keep a 3-1 lead in delegates.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told several hundred supporters jammed into a hotel ballroom that `` you have n't chosen a man, you've chosen a course, to expand our prosperity, to see that it touches every hamlet.'' `` You've chosen to back a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong enough to bring peace to the entire world,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said things had dramatically turned around in the last two days of the campaign and that he did a better job in getting his message out. He also flew in a conservative hero, former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, to help him gain votes. `` Elections hinge on two things, the candidates and the issues,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` We had the best candidate. We had the only candidate talking about issues. This leaves <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as a loser here, but I certainly would n't get overconfident. We've got a long campaign ahead of us.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> watched today's televised Oscar nominations announcement from his den, actress <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> slept through the broadcast, and writer <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> were n't talking. Actress <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' reaction to her `` Moonstruck'' nomination was captured by TV cameras and `` Broadcast News'' writer-director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was dressing in a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> hotel when he learned of the film's seven nominations. Nominees were announced at dawn in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> by actress <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The timing is designed for live East Coast network coverage. Many of the nominees watched the TV anouncement, while others were notified by publicists. <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> was awakened at his <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home by publicist <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and told about his best screenplay nomination for `` The Dead.'' His father, director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>, died last year. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> recalled his late father's advice years ago to another Oscar nominee who did n't know what to say to reporters about the nomination. The senior <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> said: `` Do n't say _ listen.'' `` <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> said he's gotten this far collaborating with <PERSON> Dad </PERSON>, and he thinks now he should take heed of his advice,'' said Miss Barr. Once again, the Academy snubbed <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> as director, although his `` Empire of the Sun'' earned six nominations. <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> was out of town, unavailable and presumably `` has no reaction,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, his spokeswoman at Amblin Productions. The moment was n't private for Miss <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, nominated as best-supporting actress in `` Moonstruck.'' About 30 people, including an `` Entertainment Tonight'' TV crew, were in her <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, home to monitor her reaction. The cousin of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who won the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary hours earlier, said she was grateful, then added: `` Like my cousin, I'm in the running and now I'm waiting for ` Super Monday' in April.'' `` Broadcast News'' writer-director <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Film Festival and was told of the seven nominations in a telephone call from publicist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> also was overlooked in the director category. `` He was quite thrilled with seven nominations. Yes, I'm sure he was somewaht disappointed about not getting that -LRB- nomination for best director -RRB-,'' she said. The publicist said nominees actor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> still were asleep an hour after their nominations were announced. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, best actor nominee for `` Wall Street,'' sat in the den of his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment to watch the announcement of his first acting nomination on television. `` I watched this morning and I looked at the names and photographs of my fellow nominees and it made me not only proud for our film ` Wall Street' but it reminded me what a wonderful part -LRB- writer-director -RRB- <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> had created,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said. `` I'm ecstatic,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, nominated for her role as a vengeful, psychotic woman in `` Fatal Attraction,'' which she said `` represents the work of an extraordinary team of people.'' Miss Close was at her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> country home when informed about her nomination by telephone from friends.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. Feb. 10 The <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> -RRB- News-Sentinel on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> mothers: Call it outmoded thinking if you will, but we find it disturbing that a large percentage of women in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> who have babies are unmarried. Of 789 active-duty women who used the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for childbirth from July 1986 through May 1987, 323 were unmarried. Of the latter, 69 percent elected to stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. A four-out-of-10 illegitimacy rate may not be considered astonishing for some, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> surely ought to hew to a higher standard. This also is more than a moral issue. Pentagon officials ought to wonder what effect this situation might have on national security. Unwed pregnant sailors and mothers surely have more on their minds than defense of the nation.

 Feb. 16 Hannibal -LRB- Mo. -RRB- Courier-Post on the court ruling against the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on homosexuals: The court has the power and the authority _ at least until the ruling is appealed or overturned _ to direct the armed forces to admit homosexuals. But the court would be hard-pressed to enforce compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the law. It's far too early to tell how the court ruling will affect the armed forces. But we can say with reasonable certainty that if the armed forces do not want homosexuals, they will find ways of forcing them out, court order or no court order. ... The great majority of Americans still regard homosexuality with contempt, and it takes more than a judicial order to change attitudes.

 Feb. 15 The <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Register on Postal Service cutbacks: In most businesses, if one company announces it will shorten hours and cut back service, its competitors leap into action, trying to win over dissatisfied customers. Not so in the mail biz, a legally protected monopoly for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service. Who loses? The letter writers, as usual. With the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> starting ... to cut back hours and eliminate Saturday window service and Sunday mail pick-ups, the time is right for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to allow some semblance of competition for mail delivery. ... The latest cutbacks in service are being blamed on budget cuts. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in December trimmed $ 1.25 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s appropriation for 1988 and 1989. The Postal Service, which should not be dependent on the taxpayers at all, is woefully unprepared for that reality. Forcing post office officials to sink or swim in competitive waters is the surest way to reform an otherwise highly inefficient monopoly.

It is, and they should. Ever since he came to power in 1985, Soviet party boss <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been sending signals that he would like to end his nation's bloody and unsuccessful attempt to impose a puppet government on the Afghans. What makes the most recent statement important is that it contains dates: full withdrawal over a 10-month period beginning May 15. The mood in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was that while the administration would prefer to see all Soviet troops withdrawn by the end of the year, it should not throw up any roadblocks. That is a sound decision.

 Feb. 11 The Spokesman-Review, <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>: Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> hopes to wipe away the past and trust that the world will forgive and forget his part in the dark history of World War II <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. His reasoning is threadbare: that everyone who served in the war knew what was happening _ the deportations, mass murders, torture; that he merely followed, rather than gave, orders. `` To deduce that knowledge constitutes some kind of crime is simply not correct,'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> claims. And he is right. But while not a crime, that knowledge coupled with his failure to act against those atrocities is a moral outrage. After a five-month investigation, an international panel of six historians decided to put aside a conclusion on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s moral responsibility for war crimes he had knowledge of as a lieutenant in the German army from 1942 to 1945; instead, the historians let the facts speak for themselves, with the world and history to pass judgment. The facts speak loudly, but <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s lies cry out. If his past is not something of which he is ashamed and afraid, why is he weaving such a web of deceit? ... If <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has his way, the chapter on his involvement in World War II atrocities is closed now. He says he will not step down as <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s president _ and he should n't have to. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> ought to pull the rug out from under him.

 A man fired from a defense plant for harassing women stalked the company for six hours, fatally shooting seven people and wounding four others as terrified employees hid under desks and in offices until he surrendered, authorities said. Among the injured was a woman who spurned his attentions, police said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, 39, of nearby <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> walked from the sprawling two-story <ORGANIZATION> ESL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> building about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday with his hands in the air. He was quickly surrounded by three officers and taken to the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. `` I'm not crazy _ I know I will die as a result of this,'' the chief negotiator, <ORGANIZATION> Sunnyvale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Rueben </PERSON> <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON>, quoted the gunman as saying before the surrender. <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an ESL business analyst, said she was in her second-floor office about 2:30 p.m. when the gunman came down the hall firing shots. She said bullets punctured her office door. `` I was under my desk in the fetal position for six hours,'' she said. `` I figured there was a sniper in the building. The worst part of all was being there all by myself in the dark. All the time I thought he was right out there in the hall.'' The bodies of two women and five men were found when police swept through the <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> building after the arrest, said Commander <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sunnyvale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. After the incident, police said five people were wounded. But this morning, Lt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> reduced the number of injured to four, adding he could not immediately explain the discrepancy. Police seized a rifle, a shotgun, 9mm and .380 - caliber handguns and two bandoliers of ammunition after the gunman left his hiding place in a second-floor <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON> said <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> told him he invaded the building to wreck equipment. ESL, or <ORGANIZATION> Electro-Magnetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was established in 1964 and specializes in electronic warfare systems for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, most of them highly classified. Products include reconnaissance systems, data-communications systems, computer simulation and image processing. It employs about 2,200 people. Police said the gunman took no hostages, but that many employees had to hide under desks or in locked rooms. On the second floor, the gunman met the woman who had spurned him, 26-year-old engineer <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. When she slammed an office door in his face, he shot her through the door, <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> told police he shot the others because `` he felt threatened by them.'' At one point, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> began crying when talking about his mother, the lieutenant said. Black was wounded in the shoulder, police said. She was listed in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after surgery. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> had worked at ESL as a computer software technician before he was fired two years ago after complaints that he sexually harassed <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and other female employees, said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuffley </PERSON>, of the company's personnel department. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who lived by himself in a dilapidated bungalow, allegedly followed <PERSON> Black </PERSON> over four years, and <PERSON> Black </PERSON> had tried to obtain a restraining order to keep him away, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` It was described to me as a situation that had turned into harassment. He had, according to him, given her a warning -LRB- to return his attentions -RRB- and she did n't heed the warning and he said this was his way of making a point,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. Near the ESL building, which is about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, police found a motor home they believe was driven by the gunman. Inside, officers found ammunition, full cans of gasoline and other explosive material, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. At one point during the negotiations, the gunman `` expressed a little remorse'' for his actions, said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. It was not clear how many of his victims the gunman knew. One of those killed was identified by company officials as <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. The rest were not identified this morning. Authorities today identified the injured, in addition to Black, as: <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsley </PERSON>, 44, in stable condition with a gunshot wound to the chest; <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 39, in good condition with gunshot wounds to the forehead and body; and <PERSON> Pattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcotte </PERSON>, 41, was in surgery this morning to repair a broken elbow suffered as she fled.

But Armed Forces chief Gen. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> told reporters in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION> that six army troops, two guerrillas and six civilians were killed during the attack. The strikes, the largest guerrilla action in nearly a year, occurred only hours before the foreign ministers of the five Central American nations met in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to evaluate implementation of a regional peace plan. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, attacked the 6th Infantry Brigade base in <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, 68 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the clandestine rebel <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said. It claimed the rebels inflicted 190 casualties, but did not break down the dead and injured. Army helicopters combed the area in search of the guerrillas, and more than a dozen houses near the base were totally or partially destroyed, <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> said. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION> said that a family of five, including three children, was killed when their house was destroyed during the rebel strike. The coordinated attacks were the largest in scale since the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> attacked the 4th Infantry Brigade in the northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> last March 31, causing 70 deaths, including that of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military adviser, and more than 100 wounded.

Guerrillas destroyed a cotton cooperative, 70 utility poles, one electrical substation, two bridges and a telephone transmission station, rebel and police reports said..

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary was a great triumph for two disparate groups, the Republican establishment and lovers of political chaos. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the quintessential establishment candidate, emerged from the ashes of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to regain the mantle of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> front-runner but his victory brightened the hopes of those who cherish rousing political brawls and hope for at least one this year that goes all the way to the convention floor. Of course it is the Democrats, with their looser rules and lack of a clear leader, who really provide hope for an open convention. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' triumph put him temporarily atop the Democratic field, but none of the seven candidates has demonstrated national appeal. And so it's `` On to the South.'' The candidates are all taking dead aim on the March 8 election day when most of the South and some key states outside will select enough delegates to settle the races in both parties. But do n't bet on a Super Tuesday resolution. The big stakes _ 1,307 Democratic delegates in 20 states and 700 Republican in 16 states may only confuse the contests rather than settle them. You have to like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chances, but both parties offer scenarios that argue for long hard fights. Two Democrats without obvious appeal in <LOCATION> Dixie </LOCATION> _ Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ split the two early events and now are confronted by Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on their own turf. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished fourth in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, solid showings in two states which have very few minority voters who provide his base of support. There is no reason to think that any of the other Democrats can compete with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the large black vote in the South. As a Tennessean who has positioned himself to the right of the rest of the Democratic field, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has run a Super Tuesday strategy that will test a generation-old political assumption _ that you ca n't win the nomination without competing in the early events. `` I think Super Tuesday changes all the rules,'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` It's a completely new ball game.'' It's a dicey strategy, but even if it falls short <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> may get enough support on March 8 to establish his candidacy and perhaps leave <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as the biggest winner of delegates that day. Then it would be on to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for four Democrats _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. That prospect would delight Republicans. But they could be in a muddle of their own. If the Southern contest were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> versus Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the outcome would appear tilted in favor of the vice president, who has a strong organization throughout the region, a strong identification with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and roots in the biggest plum of all, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But it wo n't be a two-man fight for the Republicans; Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> lives to fight on in the South and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will be battling on his home turf. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> are battling for the same voters, while <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has a constituency all his own, many of them people activated politically by a desire to support the former evangelist. Republican rules make it almost impossible for the presidential race to go all the way to the convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next August. Chances are better that two candidates _ or maybe even three _ will fight for the 175 delegates at stake in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s winner-take-all Republican primary on June 7 But if there are three Republicans battling for that delegation, the field may be so split that even a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> win would not put someone over the top. All in all, it's a volatile mix on both sides. On the morning after <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, a good bet is that Super Tuesday will settle nothing _ certainly among the Democrats _ and the cry that night will be, `` On to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, by way of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ...''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> celebrated an Ash Wednesday Mass in a 5th century church on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Aventine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> overlooking the city. During the two-hour ceremony marking the beginning of Lent, the 45-day period leading up to Easter, the pontiff recalled the phrase, `` We are ashes,'' as he urged listeners to remember their mortality. As he led a procession to the church of Saint <PERSON> Sabina </PERSON>, the late afternoon sun, unseasonably warm for mid-February, brightened the touches of gold in his vestments and those of accompanying clergy. Under the muted half-light that entered the church through the filigree-traced windows, the pontiff smudged a mixture of ash and holy water on the foreheads of cardinals. Other clergy administered to the crowds of people who surged forward to receive the benediction. The period of Lent, observed by fasting and penitence, commemorates <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' fasting in the desert.

<HEAD>Party Heads Support More Money for Presidential Transitions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chiefs of the Republican and Democratic national parties told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that they support increasing the amount of federal money spent on presidential transitions. The bill would increase to $ 3.5 million the government assistance that goes to a president-elect to begin making arrangements for a new administration. The original 1963 law provided $ 900,000, which was increased to $ 2 million in 1976. Advocates have complained that 12 years of inflation have made that insufficient. `` The scope and complexity of activity required for an efficient transition has increased significantly over the years,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said new presidents must immediately begin filling more than 3,000 executive appointments and preparing a federal budget for presentation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> within three months. Under the legislation, the federal money would go to the major parties, which would be reimbursed for transition tasks they perform. Both party leaders voiced approval of this mechanism. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the national parties have the facilities and equipment to do transition work efficiently, and that the job would `` reinforce their traditional role of providing personnel and support for their candidates.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, said that even if the financing increase is approved, the money provided might still be too low. `` I wish we could say it will cover this thing,'' he said. `` I doubt that it will.'' The legislation would require public disclosure of the sources and use of privately donated transition money, and provide for reimbursement to each political party of up to $ 200,000 for transition work performed before the general election.

 Former Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> met today with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to discuss a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks, but cautioned against expecting too much from the American mediation effort. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> told reporters after his 30-minute meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that `` one must not see too distant horizons'' for the plan <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is taking to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> leaders later this month. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, an ally of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, said he hoped <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> can overcome reservations expressed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is concerned that the proposals, which reportedly call for talks to begin in April between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> autonomy, will force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to cede land to the Arabs. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan, which has not been made public, envisions that negotiations on a final settlement for the territories that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war would begin in December. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` is trying to set the basis for continued efforts'' by the next administration to advance the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> talks, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> said. As part of his efforts to obtain continuity and congressional approval for his ideas, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will be meeting later in the day with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He held a similar meeting Tuesday night with some 25 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to outline his views. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s activity came in response to two months of Israeli-Palestinian violence in which at least 53 Palestinians have been killed. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and head of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee, follows on the heels of <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, another parliament member, who met with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Sunday. <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> is a close, trusted friend of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who faces opposition from <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> in the fractious coalition government. <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was concerned over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to set December as the date for talks on the future of the occupied territories. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, is concerned that such talks would lead to demands for land concessions to the Arabs. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> is opposed to giving back any of the captured territories, which it views as a biblical heritage and a strategic buffer zone between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is willing to relinquish some land for peace and supports an international conference to sponsor peace talks. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not advance interim solutions to the Palestinian problem. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> said `` we have taken the position that any plan must clearly include: first, an overall settlement of the problem and, second, an international conference as a framework without any attempt to outflank it.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, who met in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on Monday with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, said that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> opposed `` partial solutions or projects for self-rule'' in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> wants a final settlement through an international conference, he added. <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> reiterated <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s demand for a United Nations-sponsored international conference with the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s five permanent members and all concerned parties, including the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> starting about Feb. 25, some 24 hours after returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from meetings in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. While in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is expected to sound out the Soviets on their position regarding <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. Privately, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have suggested <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> might suggest to his counterpart <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would do all it can to ease a Soviet pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, in return for which the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would ensure the support of its Arab allies in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan.

<HEAD>Committee Approves Bill To Provide Health Coverage to Uninsured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved a controversial bill that would require employers to provide health coverage to more than 20 million uninsured people. The 10-6 vote came after nearly two hours of discussion ranging from denunciations of the insurance industry to a spirited debate over socialism and senators' own health coverage. Nevertheless, when it was all over, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the committee chairman, was pleased. `` We've got a very positive attitude here,'' he said. `` The health issue's on the national agenda. ... It's going to be difficult for people to oppose this program.'' The so-called `` minimum health'' bill sponsored by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mass </LOCATION>., would require employers to offer a minimum package that includes hospital care, doctor care, diagnostic and screening tests, pre-natal and well-baby care, and limited mental health treatment The policies would cap out-of-pocket catastrophic costs at $ 3,000. Coverage would have to be offered to employees working 17.5 hours a week or more, and their dependents. Small family farms would be temporarily exempted from coverage requirements. New businesses would be able to phase in coverage over two years. And, under an amendment adopted Wednesday, firms of five or fewer people would have five years to phase in benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates the bill would cover up to 23 million of an estimated 37 million people without insurance. The new coverage would cost about $ 27 billion, <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> said, but it would be offset by about $ 12 billion in savings on administrative costs, charity care and other outlays. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> plan taxes Americans indirectly through businesses and called it `` socialism, pure and simple.'' A frustrated Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, responded that congressional medical services, all free and conveniently located in the Capitol, are `` the most socialized medicine in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' His voice rising, <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> continued, `` Every senator takes part in it. Every House member takes part in it. But will they vote it for everyone else in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? No.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, equally frustrated, said he would vote to end the free care for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ but declined to stop his own visits immediately on principle. `` We're a bunch of hypocrites,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> conceded. He added a moment later, `` I have to admit I use it, but I do n't use it as much as most people, I think.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> called the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill a $ 30 billion solution to an $ 8 billion problem and likened it to `` using a sledge hammer to crack an egg.'' Health and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, in a letter Tuesday to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, also criticized the scope of the proposal. He said it would `` impose an unduly intrusive and centralist solution, one wholly disproportionate to the dimensions of the problem being addressed.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said the problem is `` limited in scope'' and could be resolved with sharply focused plans at the state level. The only state with compulsory employer-sponsored health insurance is <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Sen. Spark <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said 13 percent of Hawaiians were uninsured before the plan, compared to 5 percent now. Coverage requirements are more extensive than the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill, he said. `` None of the businesses are complaining. Businesses are prospering as usual,'' <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> said. `` It's working beautifully. I think it can work nationally.'' Several senators criticized the insurance industry and small business groups for failing to help develop a consensus approach to closing the health insurance gap. `` If the -LRB- insurance -RRB- industry refuses to participate, it'll be the government that does the job. Then they'll come along and say, ` Let us in, let us in,''' said Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. As for small business, `` they do n't want any bill Period. Over and out.''

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Wednesday made his seventh appearance before the grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair, presumably for more questioning about his 1986 weekend probe of the arms-for-hostages deals. Among other things, the grand jury impaneled early last year by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is believed to be focusing on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s Nov. 22-23, 1986 investigation that uncovered the diversion of arms-sale profits to the Nicraguan rebels. In recent weeks, the grand jury has heard testimony by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who found a memo revealing the diversion in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> files, and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, another member of the team. Former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who was present when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to conduct the investigation and also when the attorney general reported his findings, has testified recently. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also has testified six other times before a different grand jury investigating his financial dealings with a former officer of the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The attorney general has refused to comment on his grand jury appearances, but the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says he is cooperating with the investigation and is not a target of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s probe. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s investigation was criticized by congressional committees that held hearings last summer on the Iran-Contra affair. The panels faulted <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for not recruiting <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers with more experience investigating criminal cases and for failing to take notes during interviews with top administration officials after he learned about the diversion. The congressional committees said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s failure to secure <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> files allowed documents to be shredded by then-national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> resigned and <PERSON> North </PERSON> was fired after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced that arms-sale profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> are targets of the <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation. Indictments are expected to be returned in the coming weeks.

 Gunmen today kidnapped a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer who headed an observer group assigned to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> identified the victim as Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, chief of the 75-man observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> sources originally identified him as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was on temporary detail serving as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, is a native of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, the official said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was kidnapped in the late afternoon on the coastal highway between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s southernmost port of Tyre and the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, site of <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters. No group claimed responsibility for the abduction, which brings to 25 the number of foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One source said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was returning from talks with Shiite Moslem militia officials. `` <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was driving in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Jeep station wagon from Tyre to <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> behind a similar vehicle in which two other observers were traveling,'' <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said. He said the first vehicle went around a bend in the road, `` and when the two observers noticed that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' car was not following them, they stopped and drove back, only to find <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' station wagon abandoned,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio monitor <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurdus </PERSON>, who monitors radio stations in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was kidnapped by three gunmen driving a Mercedes car. <PERSON> Gurdus </PERSON> did not give the source of his information. The gunmen stopped <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' vehicle, forced him to board their car and speeded off toward the village of <LOCATION> Shabrikha </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gurdus </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> denied an earlier report that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had an escort of Fijian troops from <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, and said the American officer was in his station wagon alone. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> helicopters and ground troops were seaching for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had been kidnapped and gave a similar account of the kidnapping. He said 16 Americans are assigned to the observer group, although not all might be inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> at the same time. <PERSON> Goskel </PERSON> had said there were six Americans assigned to the group. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said said members of the group do not carry weapons. White House spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was informed of the incident at his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch before he left on a flight to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We are still investigating, trying to learn more about it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said as he boarded Air Force One. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was returning from a meeting in Tyre with <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, a political leader of the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem militia, a <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> official told the The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the meeting took place in a friendly atmosphere. The <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> command declined to answer questions about the abduction. But one <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> source in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> said the area of the abduction is close to the Shiite Moslem villages of Ras el-Ein and <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Qanoun </PERSON>. The two villages are controlled by Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Amal militia. But the influence of extremist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been steadily growing in both villages, Tyre-based reporters said. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> was set up in 1978 on a mission to restore peace and security and assist the Lebanese government in ensuring the return of its effective authority in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In June 1982, after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> also was given the interim task of extending protection and humanitarian assistance to the people in the area. <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION> was organized to observe and maintain the cease-fire ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in July 1948 and supervise the general armistice agreements between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. It serves as the focal point for all <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peacekeeping operations and monitors cease-fire violations on the border. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is married to Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who works at the Pentagon. She declined comment. He has a 17-year-old daughter by a previous marriage. Twenty-four other foreigners, including eight Americans, are missing and believed kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held hostage is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was seized in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> March 16, 1985. Two Scandinavians were kidnapped Feb. 5 as they were driving just outside the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> worked for the U.N.

No group claimed responsiblity for their abduction, but <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said their abductors were Palestinians acting without a political motive.

 Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, whom a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> businessman called the main cocaine trafficker in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, runs an army unit that is quartered at the National Palace and known as the country's most brutal. A <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said: `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is very popular with his troops. He likes to spread money around to them, and commands them directly. There is no normal chain of command.'' The palace's latest occupant, President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, promised in his inaugural speech Feb. 7 to stop drug trafficking in his impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> mentioned no names and was escorted into the palace after the address by military guards, including <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who carried an Uzi submachine gun. His Dessalines Battalion barracks are attached to the rear of the palace. Before the inauguration, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> often served as unofficial bodyguard to Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Regala </PERSON>. They were the military members on of the three-man provisional junta that ruled for two years after dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled the country Feb. 7, 1986. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is a stocky man of medium height, about 40, who customarily wears a ring, necklace and heavy bracelet of gold. Except for his role as informal bodyguard, for which he equips himself with an <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> and holstered Colt .45, he seldom appears in public. <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, a 35-year-old businessman, told reporters Monday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that he arranged a cocaine shipment with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, using an airstrip on the colonel's ranch to smuggle the drugs to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. He said he knew of involvement by higher Haitian officials extending up to the junta, but would not give names. His lawyer, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, said he wanted <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee investigating alleged drug smuggling by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military commander and the power behind his country's government. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said his client had testified before a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> investigating illegal drug activity in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said he ran a seafood operation until becoming involved in smuggling in August 1986. He met <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in December of that year and arranged for 220 pounds of cocaine to be shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> man said. `` We flew out of his own personal ranch in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> told the news conference. No one in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> has publicly accused <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> of drug trafficking, although rumors of his involvement are rife in diplomatic circles and among retired military officers. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat would not confirm or deny reports of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s connection with drug trafficking but acknowledged the airstrip existed He described it as `` a funny-looking highway that starts nowhere and ends nowhere, near the border'' with the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Another Western diplomat said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> owns a ranch equipped with an asphalt landing strip near <LOCATION> Thomazeau </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. He said it is believed the ranch, on the Cul-de-Sac Plain near the frontier, once belonged to <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. All the diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity. The 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, largest unit in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 6,000-man army, is also known as the most violent Men wearing the blue Dessalines shoulder patch killed most of the nearly 40 civilians shot by soldiers during anti-government strikes and protests in 1987. On the day of the aborted election Nov. 29, when thugs with guns and machetes killed at least 34 people and wounded 75, Western reporters and election observers saw truckloads of <LOCATION> Dessalines </LOCATION> soldiers stand by without intervening. Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON>, the army chief of staff, refused a request by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> for an interview with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anaise </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavenet </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday: `` The government will not give an opinion on this affair as long as it is not officially informed -LRB- by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials -RRB- through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.'' On Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Chavenet </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>: `` I personally think that he is being singled out for attack, like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> has pledged to fight drug trafficking. I do n't know how he feels about Col <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>.'' Asked during a recent interview at his home about reports of drug smuggling by the army, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said: `` I ca n't base my judgment on rumors.'' The Western diplomat who mentioned <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s popularity with his men said the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> `` is the only unit really feared here.'' He said <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> created the elite, 300-man Leopards Battalion in the early 1980s to check the power of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s unit. The Leopards, the 100-man navy, the 100-man air force and the 1,000-man Presidential Guard have the reputation of being more humane and professional. After <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled, the diplomat said, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> recruited about 100 members of the dictator's <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoute </ORGANIZATION> private militia, which terrorized <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> during 29 years of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family rule.

 `` The Last Emperor,'' a panoramic drama of modern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, scored top honors with nine nominations Wednesday in an Oscar race that included <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> but overlooked directors <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. `` Broadcast News,'' the comedy-romance set in a television news bureau, followed with seven nominations including those for stars <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was nominated as producer and writer, but surprisingly, not as director. <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s `` Empire of the Sun'' tied `` Fatal Attraction'' and `` Moonstruck'' with six nominations, but <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> was not mentioned for his direction, nor did the film make the best movie list. In 1985, <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s `` The Color Purple'' collected 11 nominations, but none for the director. Joining `` Broadcast News'' and `` The Last Emperor,'' the life story of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last monarch, as contenders for best picture were `` Fatal Attraction,'' `` Hope and Glory'' and `` Moonstruck.'' <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, the Italian director of `` The Last Emperor,'' said in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> that `` even if I've been making films for 25 years, today for the first time I feel like I passed my exams with flying colors, the sensation of becoming an adult.'' Of the best picture nominees, `` Fatal Attraction'' was the only one to place among the Top Ten money makers of 1987., It was third with a gross of $ 129,358,990, behind `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II'' and `` Platoon,'' which won the Oscar for best picture last year But most of the nominated films opened near the end of the year and are still selling tickets. Two-time winners <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> and Meryl Streep were nominated as best actor and actress for their roles as Depression-era low-lifers in `` Ironweed.'' Best actor nominees also included <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> for `` Wall Street''; Hurt, `` Broadcast News''; <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON>, `` Dark Eyes''; <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> learned the news watching television at his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment. He said, `` It made me not only proud of our film ` Wall Street,' but it reminded me of what a wonderful part <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> created.'' Joining Streep on the best actress list: <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, `` Moonstruck''; <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, `` Fatal Attraction''; Miss <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, `` Broadcast News;'' and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>.'' `` I'm ecstatic to be nominated,'' said Miss Close at her country home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I'm especially thrilled that so many connected with the film have been nominated.'' <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, who never was nominated as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, placed among the nominees for supporting actor with his role as the steely <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cop in `` The Untouchables.'' Others in the race: <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, `` Broadcast News''; <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, `` Street Smart''; <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardenia </PERSON>, `` Moonstruck''; <ORGANIZATION> Denzel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cry Freedom.''

The directors branch of the Academy neglected <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> to reward five foreigners: Britons <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON>, `` Fatal Attraction,'' and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON>, `` Hope and Glory''; <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, `` The Last Emperor''; Canadian <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewison </PERSON>, `` Moonstruck''; and Swede <PERSON> Lasse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON>, `` My Life as a Dog.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was reached at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Film Festival by his publicist, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>, who reported: `` I'm sure that he was disappointed at not getting the nomination -LRB- for his direction -RRB-. But he was so thrilled for the actors, and he was thrilled for the screenplay nomination.'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was nominated for best original screenplay, along with <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malle </PERSON>, `` Au <ORGANIZATION> Revoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enfants </ORGANIZATION>''; <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON>, `` Hope and Glory''; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanley </PERSON>, `` Moonstruck''; <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, `` Radio Days.'' Both <PERSON> Malle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON> based their scripts on their boyhood experiences in World War II. A fourth <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> entered the Academy ranks. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> was nominated for his adaptation of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>'s `` The Dead.'' If he wins an Oscar, he would be following in the footsteps of grandfather <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, father <PERSON> John </PERSON> and sister <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> was awakened with the news by his publicist <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. He told her of his late father's advice when an Academy nominee once asked what he should say to the press. `` Do n't say _ listen,'' instructed <PERSON> John </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> said he had gotten this far collaborating with his dad, and he thinks he should take heed of his advice,'' said Miss Barr. Also nominated for screenplay adaptation: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON>, `` Fatal Attraction''; <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON>, `` Full Metal Jacket''; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Peploe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, `` The Last Emperor''; <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brasse </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannstrom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Per </PERSON> <PERSON> Berglund </PERSON>, `` My Life as a Dog.'' All of the foreign language film nominees come from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: `` Au Revoir Les Enfants'' -LRB- <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -RRB-; <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s Feast'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> -RRB-; `` Course Completed'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> -RRB-; `` The Family'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> -RRB-; `` Pathfinder'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> -RRB-.

Nominations for the 60th Academy Awards included other notable omissions besides those of <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Pioneering star <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gish </PERSON> was overlooked for `` The Whales of August,'' but the acting branch saluted Miss <PERSON> Sothern </PERSON>, who started her film career in 1929 in `` The Show of Shows,'' for her role as a compassionate neighbor in `` Whales.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> received critics' raves for his Cyrano in `` <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON>,'' but neither his performance nor the script he wrote won an Academy mention. But the manic <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> won a nomination _ rare for a flat-out comedy performance _ for `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Academy voters resisted the high-pressure campaign for `` Nuts.'' Stars Barbra Streisand and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON> were not among the nominees. Also among the missing: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lone </PERSON>, `` The Last Emperor''; <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stritch </PERSON>, `` September''; <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, `` The Secret Passion of <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearne </PERSON>''; <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>, `` Barfly''; director <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Babenco </PERSON>, `` Ironweed.''

<HEAD>Israelis in Heartland Feel Less Threatened by Arab Unrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riots in the occupied lands are only an hour's drive from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, but there are no outward signs that the unrest is dampening spirits in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s entertainment capital. On a recent Saturday night, young couples crowded into the popular Cherry's Cafe, and the decibels were as deadly as ever at the Cafe Dan discotheque, which caters to the punk rock crowd. `` People's day-to-day life is not affected unless they have Arabs working for them. I think a lot of people ignore the trouble, because it seems far away,'' said <PERSON> Rickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>, a rock singer whose blond hair was streaked with a slash of red. But, sitting in a cafe on <LOCATION> Dizengoff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the center of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s night life, Ms. <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> said she was recording her first political song to protest the violence. `` It says ` Yes, enough war,' and ` No' to hate and the use of force.'' Because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is about the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, little happens that is geographically remote. <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> is only 50 miles from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and 30 miles from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. The psychological distance is much greater because a large percentage of Israelis rarely, if ever, visit the occupied lands unless they are forced to by an army call-up. In contrast, Jeruslem-area houses have had picture windows and windshields smashed by rioters, and several private cars have been torched. In neighborhood meetings, Jewish residents have warned they will use guns if necessary to defend their homes if police are unable to do so. Israelis in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> metropolitan area, which has 1.5 million Jews and about 10,000 Arabs, say they feel much less threatened than Israelis who live 45 minutes away in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which borders the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and has a one-third Arab population. `` In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, being so fully Jewish, you never really feel events like this the way you do in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. There is a different feeling in the air. People go on with their life as usual,'' said <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the city. He said the mood was summed up in a current pop song by army singers from the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> titled `` <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> Is Not Worried.'' `` People are very aware of the situation and caught up in it, but <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is a more political city. By nature, the ratio of politics to barroom conversations is lower in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavets </PERSON>, an Israeli author and immigrant from <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> residents have been called to reserve duty in the occupied areas just like other Israelis They employ some of the 40,000 Arabs who provide menial labor for <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> hotels, restaurants, construction sites and factories. Frequent Arab strikes have affected city garbage collection. More than half the 350 Arabs stayed home and several hundred <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> restaurant workers fled <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> restaurant district this week after being threatened. <PERSON> Shaptai </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahar </PERSON>, owner of the <LOCATION> Hippopotame </LOCATION> restaurant, said six <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, including both cooks, went home after two Arab militants came to the kitchen and threatened to harm the workers' families if they did not observe a boycott of Israeli businesses. <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s intellectual capital, and the uprising by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> nationalists has spurred many to urge peace negotiations and an end to the use of force against the 1.5 million residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The Association of Israeli Playwrights organized a gathering in the Tzavta theater Tuesday that drew widely known actors, singers and authors, including several who had not previously expressed their views publicly on the unrest. `` The most difficult struggle is taking place in the minds of Israelis. It's a struggle between emotions and reason,'' <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, 33, said during a debate with a group of young intellectuals and artists who gathered in his apartment. <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a teacher of filmmaking who was a tank commander in the 1973 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war and has done reserve duty in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said the unrest has made him ready to challenge the authorities. `` If I am called up, I will go. But I wo n't beat anyone or do anything to support the occupation,'' he said. `` If they put me in a tank, I will aim the cannon outside the borders.''

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s main opposition party pressured the government Wednesday to follow <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s lead and scrap some nuclear missiles before a U.S.-Soviet missile treaty goes into effect. <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, disarmament expert for the opposition Social Democrats, said Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> should respond to the early Soviet missile reductions by dismantling <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 72 Pershing 1A missiles. `` Such a reaction would be equal to developing trust in disarmament which the leadership in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has been working toward with the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, speaking on behalf of the party, told reporters. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, reported Tuesday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had dismantled SS-12 nuclear missiles in Waren, an East German site about 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The SS-12s are included in a U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate the superpowers' medium - and shorter-range missiles <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> announced before the superpower pact was signed that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would scrap its Pershing 1A missiles as part of a new treaty. The Pershing 1A missiles are owned by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> controls the rockets' nuclear warheads. On Wednesday, East German newspapers printed photos of dismantled missiles and hailed the Soviet preparations for removing the SS-12s before the treaty is ratified. `` Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' the Communist party's official newspaper <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said in a banner headline. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December. The agreement stipulates that the Soviets' shorter-range missiles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are to be removed within 18 months and medium-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles within three years. Three Senate committees are debating the treaty and ratification may come during the summer. The Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s parliament, is expected to approve the accord In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate reaction to the report. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity said the Soviets were free to remove their missiles before the treaty takes effect. The official said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will go to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and all other Soviet missile sites to verify compliance with the treaty if it is ratified. ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when they would be returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, only that Soviet soldiers `` are making the last preparations to return their SS-12 rockets. `` With this step we can make an important contribution toward disarmament even before the treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ratified,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> wrote. East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said in January that Soviet intermediate-range rockets based in his country could be removed ahead of schedule, but at the time gave no specific timetable. According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice missiles were stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Waren </ORGANIZATION>, which has the largest numbers of SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There are three other SS-12 sites in the country. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also has shorter-range SS-23 nuclear missiles based in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>OSHA Letter Prompts Rust Engineering Officials To Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president and four other officials of an engineering firm have resigned in the wake of allegations that one of the executives improperly tried to influence a federal safety agency. The allegations stem from a letter written in December by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of safety and security, to an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, in which <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> offered to testify favorably about the agency before a congressional committee. In return, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> wrote, he sought <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to `` reasonable'' penalties against Rust Engineering, based in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, for safety violations at <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>'s garbage-to-energy plant <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was one of the five who resigned Tuesday, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. Rust is building the $ 200 million plant in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> proposed $ 54,000 in penalties against the company for alleged safety violations at the site. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> confirmed that the resignations were the result of a letter written by <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> in December. She said company President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Campa </PERSON> had reviewed and approved <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s letter before it was sent to <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this month, the company retracted the letter and said it was unauthorized. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> on Tuesday reaffirmed that statement, saying that the letter had been unauthorized despite de la Campa's approval Rust officials said in a statement, `` The actions taken -LRB- sending the letter to <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- were not in keeping with the high professional standards of the company.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general's office and the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office are investigating whether Rust officials sought to improperly influence <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Americans Are Healthy But Feel Lousy</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release at 6 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans have never been healthier, but they feel worse and worse, a doctor says. Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsky </PERSON> calls this `` the paradox of health.'' The nation's collective health has improved dramatically over the past 30 years, yet people report increasingly high rates of disability and a general dissatisfaction with their health. <PERSON> Barsky </PERSON>, a psychiatrist at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, blames this on several factors, including people's obsession with diet and exercise and their unrealistic expectations of what medicine can do for them. Writing in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barsky </PERSON> noted that the life expectancy of a child born in 1984 was 75 years. In 1900, it was 47. Since 1970 alone, the life expectancy has increased by four years. However, surveys show that people report twice as many episodes of disabling illness now than they did in the 1920s, before the introduction of antibiotics. In the 1970s, 61 percent of Americans said they were satisfied with their health. A decade later, this had fallen to 55 percent. `` Our subjective feeling of healthiness and physical well-being has decreased, even though there have been major advances in our actual, objective health status,'' <PERSON> Barsky </PERSON> wrote. One reason is medicine's conquest of diseases that kill quickly. It lets people grow old so they die with diseases that linger. People who are saved from pneumonia and tuberculosis live long enough to be afflicted with arthritis and diabetes. `` Thus, we live longer, but a greater proportion of our life is spent in ill health,'' he wrote. Among other factors cited by <PERSON> Barsky </PERSON>: _ People's fascination with diet, exercise and healthy living means they spend more time thinking about their bodies This erodes their sense of well-being, because they are more negative about their health when they dwell on it. _ The proliferation of do-it-yourself diagnostic kits, health magazines, fat farms and other health products makes people more conscious of trivial symptoms Every twinge and ache becomes the sign of a horrifying disease. This, along with news media exaggeration of such rare health problems as toxic shock syndrome, `` induces a cultural climate of alarm and hypochondria, undermining feelings of well-being.'' _ People go to the doctor twice as often as they did 50 years ago Frequently they seek help for such minor complaints as sore muscles, colds and upset stomaches. This `` medicalization of daily life'' leads people to think that all of their discomforts are curable, and they are disappointed when they are not.

<HEAD>Biltmore Theater Goes for Over $5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Biltmore Theater, one of the largest houses on Broadway, has been sold for $ 5.35 million, and the new owner says he'll try to use it as a cabaret theater. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON>, who bought the theater at auction Tuesday, said through a spokesman that he plans to keep the 948-seat house as a theater. But other theater owners said the high price could force <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON> to develop the site's air rights. The auction started with a base price of $ 4 million. The sale was tentative, pending the working out of final details. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Waskow </PERSON>, a spokesman for Properties at Auction, which managed the sale, said <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON> was negotiating with an unidentified producer interested in becoming a new tenant in the building. `` The proposed tenant has in mind to use the Biltmore as a cabaret theater,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, president of Properties at Auction. `` They want to try something that has never been done in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' The interior of the theater, which opened in 1925 at on West 47th Street, was given landmark status late last year, so any changes would have to be approved by the city. The building comes with 136,000 square feet of air rights on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. The last long-running hit in the theater was the musical `` Hair,'' which closed in 1972 after more than four years.

<HEAD>Disciplinary Inquiry Ordered In Ulster Police Shootings</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> police Wednesday announced a disciplinary inquiry against officers involved in the killing of six unarmed men in the province in three incidents in late 1982. The investigation, headed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, chief constable of the <LOCATION> Staffordshire </LOCATION> force, will delve into a controversy that has resurfaced this year to embarrass the British government and seriously damage its relations with <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Royal <PERSON> Ulster </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, said the inquiry was ordered by its chief constable, Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON>. It did not say how many officers would be investigated or what penalties they might face. The announcement came three weeks after the government disclosed that evidence had emerged of perjury and subversion of justice in an alleged cover-up of the circumstances of the shootings. On Jan. 25, the government said it would not prosecute the police officers involved, provoking angry reactions from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> as well as British opposition politicians. The decision to take disciplinary action was seen as an attempt to placate the Irish government, while the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it confirmed longstanding allegations of police misconduct in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` This is perhaps one of the most serious and grave statements we have heard about the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> security forces in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman on <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, in a House of Commons debate. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> told Parliament: `` Undoubtedly serious mistakes were made which have damaged the reputation of the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the issues `` go to the heart of the problems faced by a police force using the normal processes of law while fighting a ruthless and vicious terrorist enemy.'' The shootings were investigated for two years by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON>, then assistant chief constable of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. He found that five deaths occurred when police, in separate incidents, fired on moving cars. The occupants were unarmed but were acknowledged by their organizations as guerrillas. The sixth victim was a teen-ager who stumbled on a guerrilla explosives hideout that was under police surveillance and was shot in still-unexplained circumstances. Stalker this month published a book claiming he was dumped from the inquiry because his findings threatened to implicate senior <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> officers in murder. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the inquiry would determine whether to bring disciplinary action against officers up to the rank of chief superintendent. The <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ireland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, a police-civilian watchdog body, would have to decide whether more senior officers should be disciplined, he said. King also outlined structural changes in the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> prompted by the lessons of the 1982 shootings. In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, in a parliamentary debate on the worsening state of Anglo-Irish relations, <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said recent controversies concerning <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> had aroused `` strong feelings of Irish public opinion.'' Besides the 1982 shootings, he cited: _ The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> appeals court's refusal Jan. 28 to grant a retrial to six Irishmen serving life sentences for twin bomb attacks that killed 21 people in 1974. The six claim they are innocent and were convicted on faulty forensic evidence and confessions they say were beaten out of them. _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s refusal to fulfill conditions set down by <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for the extradition of Irish terrorist suspects to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> police under a new extradition treaty that took effect Dec. 1. _ The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government's announcement Tuesday that it will make its controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act a permanent law, rather than requiring annual parliamentary renewal. The 13-year-old act empowers police to hold terrorism suspects for up to seven days without charging them or giving them access to a lawyer.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on Wednesday portrayed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides as the hatchetmen of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential campaign with `` all the axes in town ... swinging them in every state.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> promised to swing back if attacked again. `` You're seeing a mean <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. You ought to take a look at some of the things they have been doing and saying,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> declared as he tried to rebound from his stinging defeat at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hands in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said he had been too soft on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and had erred in the final days of the campaign by not responding to negative ads run by the vice president's campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, denied he had done anything wrong. `` I'm not going to dwell on it, you see, I do n't want to be drawn into something like that,'' the vice president said to reporters. `` People in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> like clean campaigns, and they endorsed me overwhelmingly.'' Sticking with his contention that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ads were false, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he would not make the same mistake again. He was careful to say that his aides would do the heavy lifting in the counterattacks, which were already under way. `` The problem with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is that he has n't got a record,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> told reporters on the campaign plane from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` If somebody can tell me what he has done in the last seven years, I'll buy somebody a steak.'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> officials would not distort the record as they said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had done. `` We do n't have to wallow in the mud with them to answer their charges,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> himself did try to stay away from a role in the counterattacking, which is a sensitive subject in light of his reputation as once the toughest hatchetman of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. Asked if the new tactics threaten to revive that old image, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said it is the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign that faces the image problem. `` They have all the axes in town. They seem to be swinging them in every state,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> pointed to an ad run by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> that accused him of straddling the issues of taxes, an oil import fee and the medium-range missile treaty. And <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> reminded reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> campaign manager had attacked <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for `` cronyism'' and `` mean-spiritedness'' and raised questions about his wife's blind trust. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> blamed part of his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> problem on the surge of expectations that built after he trounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses on Feb. 8. `` If expectations had n't gotten so good, it would have been a victory today,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters at the airport in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We did n't win. But that's only one step along the way. We're going to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> talked with reporters on the campaign plane as it flew from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spent the day in meetings and in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on campaign financing. He was asked if he had been too soft on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Probably,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> replied. Should he have fired back at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>? `` Yes, that's my guess,'' he said. `` I think we sat on our hands for three days.'' As for the dispute distorted ads, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> airport, `` I'm not going to run from it. I'm not known for running from a fight.'' `` I never said I was going to raise your taxes. I did n't say I was advocating a $ 10-a-barrel import fee. But that's what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ads say and they are not true. It was <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> who laid out the new tactics for the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign against possible future <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks. `` When he does it from now on, we're going to respond very, very forcefully,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said on the plane. `` We're tired of it. We're sick to the gills of this type of tactic. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON>, campaign on your own,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> lectured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> via the media. `` Earn it on your own. Do n't try to put somebody else down.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, the convicted rapist who was freed from prison in 1985 after his alleged victim recanted, on Wednesday was ordered behind bars for at least six months for violating the conditions of his parole. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s plea for another chance and ruled that he had violated the terms of parole for failing to report to his parole officer last Dec. 24. The board ordered <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> held in state prison until Aug. 16, when he will be eligible for parole again and may be released from prison if he complies with conditions set by the board, said <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was ordered by the board to undergo a substance abuse treatment program while in prison. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s case drew national attention when <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> homemaker, recanted her testimony that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> had raped her when she was a suburban teen-ager. After three days of hearings in 1985, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> commuted <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s sentence of 25 to 50 years to the six years he had served. The governor did not pardon <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, saying he did not believe the recantation. Since then, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> has had numerous scrapes with the law, which under the good-conduct terms of his commutation could result in him being ordered to serve out the remainder of his sentence. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was imprisoned last year for violating his parole terms by being convicted on drunken driving charges. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> freed <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> a second time when he modified his 1985 commutation order to allow <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> out on Dec. 24 in what the governor called `` a last-chance deal.'' Two days later, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was arrested after a bar fight in suburban <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Prosecutors later dropped battery charges in that incident, but <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> remained in jail on a `` parole hold.'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> told the review board during a hearing Tuesday that he is an alcoholic and needed treatment. The ruling disappointed <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s family. `` I just do n't understand why they've got to keep him in jail,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, one of his five sisters. `` Why ca n't they just put him in a halfway house or something? He's been in jail long enough for something he did n't do. We want him in a rehab _ but not in jail.''

<TEXT>
 Southern political leaders from both parties on Wednesday outlined a series of issues they want the presidential candidates to address as they shift their attention to Super Tuesday. A report, prepared for the candidates by the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, detailed issues ranging from rural development to welfare reform to energy and environmental policy. Former <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> told a news conference that the report lists problems that need attention in the South, but does not outline a list of acceptable solutions that might be interpreted as a `` Southern litmus test'' for the presidential candidates. Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the sunbelt caucus, said the report will `` help define and clarify some of the issues that confront the nation and our region.'' `` The candidates have got to change their focus and address issues of concern to our region,'' he said. `` For the first time, the South's political voice -LRB- through Super Tuesday -RRB- will match the South's number of voters.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said, for example, that none of the candidates have explained their goals and plans for the space program, which is vital to the economies of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He said the South also is facing a social crisis, with one out of every five Southerns on welfare, and the presidential candidates will be expected to respond with meaningful welfare reform proposals. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said the level of illiteracy in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> is a major problem that Southern voters want the presidential candidates to address as they head toward Super Tuesday A total of 20 states, 14 of them in the South, will hold primaries or caucuses on Super Tuesday, March 8. The Democrats will be vying for 1,307 delegates in 20 states while the Republicans battle for 700 delegates in 16 states.

 Nine out of 10 American hospitals have policies restricting smoking, and a growing number are banning smoking from their premises entirely, according to a study released Wednesday. More than half the surveyed hospitals that restrict or ban smoking said they had a moral responsibility to do so, according to <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbury </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healthcare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION>. `` Health-care executives are taking seriously their role in promoting wellness,'' <PERSON> Wesbury </PERSON> said at a news conference where he released results of the college's survey of 770 hospitals. `` The number of respondents who report they have banned smoking is extremely impressive when one considers the nature of a hospital,'' <PERSON> Wesbury </PERSON> said. `` It's not easy to simply say ` no smoking' with the number of people, many of them under tremendous stress, who use the facility each day as patients or visitors.'' Of the 90 percent of respondents with smoking policies in effect last year, 8 percent had outright bans on smoking by employees, physicians, patients and visitors, the college found. In 1981, a survey of more than 3,000 hospitals by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> found `` maybe one or two in the country'' with outright bans on smoking, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, manager of worksite-health promotion for that Chicago-based organization. Typical of those with smoking bans is St. Cloud Hospital of St. Cloud, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, a 489-bed hospital that banned smoking last November. Sister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revier </PERSON>, organizer of its smoke-free policy, said exceptions are made for patients in the hospital's chemical-dependency and psychiatric wards and for patients who obtain written permission to smoke from a doctor Fewer than 10 such physician orders have been written since the policy went into effect, she said. There had been no problems with employee smoking, Sister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said, adding she did not expect any to arise. The hospital offered its employees educational programs and stop-smoking classes for a year before the ban began, she said. `` People are in a sense embarrassed to smoke among other employees,'' she said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frobenius </PERSON>, the hospital president, said St. Cloud's smoke-free policy had created less of a stir than he had expected, although he said one woman chose to have her baby at another hospital rather than give up smoking during her stay The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> will go smoke-free on April 1, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloem </PERSON>, executive vice president of the 654-bed complex, which includes three hospitals and 100 outpatient clinics. `` This is the second phase of a long-term policy to eliminate smoking -LRB- from the center -RRB- altogether,'' <PERSON> Bloem </PERSON> said. `` We have looked at smoking as a major public-health problem and see this as an opportunity for our institutions to promote the health of patients, staff and visitors as well as maintaining the health of our patients,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Federal authorities are seeking a fugitive who fled to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> after allegedly stealing three valuable paintings from a wealthy family and arranging to have them sold by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auction house. The paintings were recovered after they were auctioned but before they were shipped to the buyers. A federal grand jury last week indicted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zentefis </PERSON>, a former foreman at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> storage warehouse, in the thefts from heiress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>. The paintings _ `` Summer, <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>'' by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Inness </PERSON>, `` End of Day'' by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cazin </PERSON>, and `` River Landscape'' by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyant </PERSON> _ were once owned by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> coal magnate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> died in 1960 and his wife died in 1963. The paintings were inherited by Ms. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, who placed them in storage at a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> warehouse in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zentefis </PERSON> worked at warehouse, according to the indictment. In 1979, Federal Moving and Storage went bankrupt and the boxes were supposed to be transferred to the warehouse of a different company. In 1984, a friend of the <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> family noticed that `` Summer, <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>,'' a 100-year-old landscape painting, had been listed in a circular sent out by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s, the well-known auction house. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was notified, and agent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiel </PERSON> was dispatched to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, according to the indictment. Spiel found that `` Summer, <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>' had been auctioned to an unidentified <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> man for $ 90,750.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Hits 5-Year Low; Some Economists Fear
Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing construction suffered a second consecutive monthly decline in January, dipping to the weakest pace since the end of the last recession, the government reported Wednesday. The 1.9 percent January decline in construction of single-family homes and apartments, reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, raised new concerns among some economists about the possibility of a recession this year. However, other analysts pointed to a second government report showing that industrial production rose for the fourth consecutive month in January. The 0.2 percent rise in industrial output followed larger gains of 0.4 percent in both November and December. Economists are looking for continued strength in manufacturing, bolstered by rising export sales, to offset expected weakness in the consumer sector. The January decline in housing construction followed an even larger 15.5 percent December plunge and pushed building activity down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million units, the slowest pace since a rate of 1.30 million units in December 1982, just as the last recession was ending. Housing is being watched very closely in the aftermath of the record 508-point drop in the stock market last October because it is often one of the first sectors to weaken at the onset of a new recession. Economists said the two consecutive monthly declines in housing construction did not guarantee a recession, especially since other economic sectors have been showing strength. But analysts said further weakness in this important industry would be troubling. `` If housing continues to weaken, it would obviously increase the chances of a recession,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Wharton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Econometrics </LOCATION>. `` The rise in exports would not be enough to offset a big drop in housing and consumer spending. A lot will depend on what happens in the next few months.'' `` The weakness suggests that people have been scared by the stock market crash and are unwilling to take on the commitment of a home mortgage,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Other analysts said that unusually severe January weather had contributed to the decline in starts last month and they predicted better figures in coming months, particularly in view of the fact that mortgage rates have been dropping in recent weeks. Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages have fallen to a nationwide average of 9.84 percent, down almost a full percentage point since Jan. 1 and the first time they have been in single-digits since last April. `` We expect housing starts will pick up in February and March. Interest rates are lower and consumer confidence and employment have both strengthened,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The weakness last month came from a 2.9 percent decline in construction of single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate of 1.01 million units. This drop offset a 0.8 percent increase in construction of multi-family housing, which edged up to an annual rate of 366,000 units. That was still 35 percent below the level of activity in the apartment sector a year ago. Activity in the apartment sector reflects a slump that followed enactment of the new tax law, which removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real estate. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said that a rate of single-family starts above 1 million still reflected strength in that sector, but he said the overall industry was being held back by the prolonged slump in apartment activity. He said multi-family construction is likely to fall further, especially in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where vacancy rates are high. In January, construction starts fell 17.1 percent in the South to an annual rate of 469,000 units. Starts were down an even larger 21.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 223,000 units. Two other regions showed strength, however. Starts rose 27.6 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 291,000 units and were up 21.2 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to a rate of 394,000 units. Building permits, considered a good sign of future activity, fell 8.2 percent in January to an annual rate of 1.25 million units, the lowest level for permits since January 1985. Permits had fallen 7.4 percent in December. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s report on industrial production showed the January strength came from production of non-durable goods, which rose 0.4 percent. Production of durable goods, items expected to last three years, showed no increase last month as a big drop in auto and steel production offset increases in the output of light trucks and defense equipment.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> dismissed his poor showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and sought support Wednesday in Southern states, saying too much emphasis had been put on early presidential contests. He also criticized fellow Democratic candidates, accusing them of being out of touch and saying, `` I see all of the other candidates as peas in the same pod.'' `` This is the kickoff of the main event in this election year,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at a conference for supporters telecast from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` This is the time we kick our campaign into high gear.'' He made his comment about `` peas in the same pod'' earlier, in an interview on `` CBS This Morning.'' In that same interview, he said his rivals picked up some harmful `` political baggage in the form of positions they adopted'' in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he had no regrets about skipping the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and turning his money and attention to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where more than a dozen states have contests on March 8, known as Super Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator, who finished fifth in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary Tuesday with about 7 percent of the vote, had campaigned little there and in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where he also did poorly. `` The importance of Super Tuesday is not simply in the fact that almost half the delegates will be selected on March 8,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` The importance of Super Tuesday is also in the fact that there are people all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who have been waiting to see more power given to Democrats at the grass-roots level in the selection of a Democratic nominee.'' The conference was telecast to an estimated 52 locations in more than 30 cities. About 40 supporters attended at the site of the telecast in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said three <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals _ he later identified them as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ `` have taken positions on foreign policy and defense policy that are completely out of touch with the mainstream voters in this country.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who finished second in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, has flip-flopped on issues in his campaign, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` It is now very widely known that <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s positions adopted for the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses are just completely at odds with what he's done in the last 12 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` There's a very long list; it's not just one or two positions.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had other scheduled stops in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Wednesday as he continued his campaign in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and other Super Tuesday states. `` We're going to win it because we've conserved our resources to aim right at the Super Tuesday states,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first million-dollar lottery winner has already changed his telephone number because people keep calling to suggest ways of sharing or investing his fortune. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s hands were still shaking after winning the grand prize Saturday when a woman in the crowd handed him a pamphlet for a charity and walked away without saying a word. That was just the beginning of the hassles of being a new millionaire, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said. Actually, he is n't quite a millionaire. His after-tax winnings of $ 800,000 were transferred into his bank account Tuesday. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s win was the more astounding because he never bought a ticket, something he says he'll never do because he's opposed to all lotteries. Instead, he found a ticket that had been discarded in front of his store and sent it in to the million-dollar drawing, which included about 460,000 other entries. Proceeds from the lottery are earmarked for education, and on Wednesday, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s assistant commissioner of education received a check for $ 46.2 million, representing the first installment. The game has generated sales of about 300 million $ 1 tickets in five weeks. `` It's a red-letter day for us,'' said Lottery Secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. `` We're extremely proud and pleased.'' The money will be used to pay for such items as student financial aid, dropout prevention programs, equipment, library books and training programs for February and March. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brantley </PERSON>, who presented the check to <LOCATION> Laurey </LOCATION> Stryker, assistant commissioner of education, said he wanted to emphasize that the lottery wo n't generate enough money to take care of all education needs and that Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> wants the proceeds to be used for one-time expenses to enhance education, rather than for operating costs. Since the drawing, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said his telephone has n't stopped ringing. `` I've got a few calls from charities,'' he said. `` But they're not as big a hassle as the various investment companies ... Everybody says they want to help.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said he had his telephone number changed Monday to an unlisted number. But that did n't stop aggressive fortune-seekers who somehow learned his new number. At home, his wife and daughters screen the calls. Several employees do the same at his <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> paint store. `` There are undoubtedly a million charities worth giving to,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said. `` I do n't question that. Everyone ca n't support everything. Even the government ca n't do that, and they've got a lot more money than I do.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> already has pledged 10 percent of the money to his church and does not know whether he will give any of the remaining money away. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said he will take advice from the accountant who has handled his business finances for the last several years. There will be no special consultants or high-priced investment firms, he said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had shelved plans for a `` ship of return'' to take 130 deported Palestinians to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, two days after the vessel was bombed in a <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> harbor. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said a last attempt to charter another ship had failed. `` We have now decided to temporarily postpone the date of sailing,'' said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sayeh </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature. He was the first person <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported after capturing <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. He told a news conference the voyage would take place `` in the near future,'' but organizers would not mention a date. They sent home the hundreds of people, including observers and journalists scheduled to make the trip, who had been in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> for nine days. Those involved said it may have been the largest non-violent protest ever attempted by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, a member of the organizing committee and interpreter for <PERSON> Sayeh </PERSON>, called the effort a success because `` it has shown the world the amount of terrorism that is directed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It is ready to blow up a ship simply because it has Palestinian people going on a peaceful mission,'' said <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, who was president of <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> before he was deported. The Sol <PERSON> Phryne </PERSON>, a ferry obtained for the voyage, was damaged Monday by a mine attached below the waterline at <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of planting the mine, which ripped a six-foot hole in the ferry's hull. Israeli officials did not deny it and Transport Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfu </PERSON> said that, if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> gets another ship, `` its fate will be the same.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called the voyage `` a declaration of war.'' <PERSON> Bassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, claimed earlier that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> made the search for a ship difficult by threatening owners and crew members. The voyage initially had been scheduled to begin Feb. 9 at <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, the port of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The voyage was intended to focus attention on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy of deporting Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> declared last month that such expulsions are illegal. Jordanian and Palestinian figures say up to 3,000 Palestinians have been deported since 1967. On Sunday, the day before the ship was mined, three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officers were killed in <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION> by a bomb planted in their car. Thousands of Palestinians and <PERSON> Jordanians </PERSON> attended a funeral Wednesday in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, for two of the victims, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Tamimi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bheis </PERSON>.

 A few leftovers from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary campaign, tales of food and love, laughs and life along the political trail: First, the food. Presidential candidates have such tight schedules they often do n't get a chance to eat. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of Illinois detoured through a Burger King drive-in for a hamburger on one swing. Former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> dined on finger sandwiches at a Head Start center. But Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ate three breakfasts within an hour one morning _ not because he was hungry, but because the polls had him running behind Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had switched his campaign style to one of more informality, sliding into booths with voters for pancakes at <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON>'s family restaurant, coffee at <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin </ORGANIZATION>' Donuts and anEgg McMuffin at <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. The next morning, on voting day in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, a woman at the polls told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> she had skipped breakfast to see him. `` I'm not having breakfast today,'' he said. `` I had three of them yesterday.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Now, some love notes: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, met a young woman from <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> named <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> while campaigning for his father in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary eight years ago. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost that one to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. They were married and came back to campaign for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this time. After <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had telephoned Soviet refusenik <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Keis-Kuna </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> to offer his support and best wishes, she sent him a kiss. On that same day, Sunday, Valentine's Day, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaigned in the streets of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. One of his stops was a florist's shop where he presented his wife, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, with red roses. She gave him a real kiss. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> may not have won the hearts and minds of the voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, finishing sixth among the seven Democratic candidates, but he's a winner to <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON>, his wife. Often at his side, she would reassure him, `` You're my candidate.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 It helps to be able to laugh a little, especially when you're hurting a lot While <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> came up a loser when the votes were counted, he wins an award for best self-depreciating humor. Example: `` You know a guy came up to me in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> and shook his head and said to me, ` <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, you were in it right up to the very beginning.'''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 And, you know, a candidate's got ta do what a candidate's got ta do. When <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, he praised <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters for being intelligent and for not falling for campaign imagery. Then he got caught up in it himself, flying to the far north country to remote but politically famous Dixville Notch where the few residents grab a lot of attention in the media every primary year by casting the nation's first votes. By the time those ballots went in the box this time, though, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> had given up his campaign.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 And it's nice to get a little help from your friends, especially if they are heavy hitters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought in some for his campaign. He had <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> baseball Hall of Fame slugger, on his side. He also had the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s Mr. Conservative, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> senator and the party's 1964 presidential nominee, in his corner. And jazz artist <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> performed at house parties.

 Australian <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> picked a crisp, cloudless day for his first trip to the top of the Empire State Building Wednesday. But he did it the hard way _ he ran. <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> led a field of 79 men and 27 women who thundered up the stairwell to the top of the 102-story landmark for glory, fitness and the first-place prize of a MacIntosh computer in the 11th Annual Empire State Building Run-Up. His winning time was 11 minutes, 29 seconds. `` It was n't too bad, really,'' <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, a 26-year-old pastry chef from <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, said modestly. Still, he admitted, `` It gets a bit boring, going around and around and around.'' The top women's finisher was Olympic hopeful <PERSON> Janine </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, whose time of 13 minutes, 43 seconds, was 28 seconds off her women's record in the event, set in 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Suffern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, interrupted her training for the Olympic marathon to compete for the fifth time in the event. `` It feels great,'' she said after her victory. `` My mom was here, my aunts from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It was just so great to see their faces.'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said he won the opportunity to compete in the Empire State Building Run-Up by winning a similar event last August in a 56-story hotel in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>. `` That one felt harder,'' he said. He attributed his victory in part to being the first man into the stairwell _ no small advantage, considering the crunch of bodies that followed him.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is planning to name <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a leading expert on Soviet affairs, as the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 57, now the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, will replace <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, a career foreign service officer who has served in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> since 1985 and is being considered for another post in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Assuming he is confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will play an important role in the growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drive to promote peace talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. His job would entail trying to persuade a reluctant Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to yield territory on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in exchange for a settlement. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s resistance to a concession opposed by the Likud coalition could test the diplomatic skill of the 32-year veteran of the foreign service. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> served as deputy ambassador to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s capital _ from 1979 to 1981. He is known primarily as an expert in Soviet and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs, and as a linguist. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> graduate and ex-Marine, speaks Russian, Chinese, French, Japanese, Mongolian and Malay. He was a leading contender for the ambssador's post in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, probably the most important in the foreign service, before <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> was selected by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January 1987. One of the touchy angles in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomacy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is the role to be played by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> insists on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s taking an active part, while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is opposed to its participation in consideration of an <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> settlement. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s two main reasons are that the Soviets generally support Arab positions and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Ties were broken by the Soviets in 1967, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defeated <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in the Six-Day war. Last year, however, the Soviets sent a diplomatic delegation to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and a small <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> group is likely to go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year.

<HEAD>Congressmen to Sue Census Over Count of Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A coalition of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that they plan to sue the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to force the agency to delete illegal aliens from its count in 1990. Some 40 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> joined the Federation for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> in announcing that the suit would be filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, spokesmen said at a news conference here. The group contends that including the estimated 2 million or more illegal aliens in the national head count, which is used to distribute seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, will cause unfair shifts of seats from one state to another. Census officials say they are required to count everyone by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution, which does not mention citizenship but only instructs that the House apportionment be based on the `` whole number of persons'' residing in the various states. That approach was upheld by a federal court in a similar suit, brought by the same immigration reform group, before the 1980 Census. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> of the immigration reform federation contended that illegal aliens should not be allowed to be part of determining the political structure of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., said the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> should actually count everyone but that it should develop a method to determine how many people are illegally in the country, and them deduct that number from the figures used for reapportioning <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, R-Kan., suggested including a question on the Census form asking whether respondents are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizerns

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave unanimous approval Wednesday to legislation ratifying an international agreement to control ozone-destroying chemicals. The legislation, endorsed on a voice vote, is tied to last September's agreement by industrialized nations to cut production of widely used chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, by up to 50 percent by 1999. CFCs, used as refrigerants, aerosol can propellants and industrial solvents, migrate into the stratosphere, where they destroy the ozone molecules that help screen the Earth from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. The Montreal Protocol on CFCs is slated to take effect once it has been ratified by 11 nations representing at least two-thirds of the world's 1986 consumption of the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds covered under the pact. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was a driving force behind the landmark environmental protection agreement.

 Mega-hit moviemaker <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> was snubbed again Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> as a nominee best director, although his `` Empire of the Sun'' earned six nominations. <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, the top moneymaking director of all time but never a winner for best director, was out of town and presumably `` has no reaction,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, his spokeswoman at Amblin Productions. <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> was nominated for direction in `` Jaws,'' `` Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and `` E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial.'' Five years ago `` E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial,'' the biggest-grossing movie in history, did not win either for best picture or for <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s direction. Then, two years ago, and after such smashes as `` Jaws,'' `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' `` E.T.'' and the `` <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION>'' adventures, it seemed <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s establishment would embrace `` The Color Purple,'' a drama fraught with social significance. However, <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> was not nominated for his direction, though the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> voted its 1985 best-directed film prize to <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and `` The Color Purple.'' This year, <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> was in distinguished company among the overlooked. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was nominated for producing the best-picture nominee `` Broadcast News'' and for writing it, but not as director. The directors branch of the Academy neglected <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> to reward five foreigners: Britishers <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> -LRB- `` Fatal Attraction'' -RRB- and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON> -LRB- `` Hope and Glory'' -RRB-; Italian <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Last Emperor'' -RRB-; Canadian <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewison </PERSON> -LRB- `` Moonstruck'' -RRB-; and Swede <PERSON> Lasse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> -LRB- `` My Life as a Dog'' -RRB-. Nominations for the 60th Academy Awards included other notable omissions besides those of <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Pioneering star <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gish </PERSON> was overlooked for `` The Whales of August.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> won critical raves for his performance in `` <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON>,'' but neither his performance nor the script he adapted from the play `` Cyrano de Bergerac'' won an Academy mention. The manic <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, won a nomination _ rare for a flat-out comedy performance _ for `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Academy voters also resisted the high-pressure campaign for `` Nuts.'' Stars Barbra Streisand and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON> were n't among the nominees. Also among the missing: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lone </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Last Emperor'' -RRB-; <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stritch </PERSON> -LRB- `` September'' -RRB-; <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Secret Passion of <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearne </PERSON>'' -RRB-; <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> -LRB- `` Barfly'' -RRB-; and director <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Babenco </PERSON> -LRB- `` Ironweed'' -RRB-.

<TEXT>
 All eyes turn toward <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> this week as Democratic and Republican presidential candidates converge on <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for the first major event of the Super Tuesday campaign _ the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> debates. The 12 candidates who survived the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary have set their sights on the 20 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday, March 8, focusing much of their attention on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which leads the states with 183 Democratic and 111 Republican delegates. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is the crown jewel in this because we are the largest,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>. The debates, which will be aired nationally on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, begin Thursday at 9 p.m. EST with the Democratic candidates. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hopefuls debate the following night. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Democrat who calls Southern states key to a presidential win, and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate who maintains a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> address, say they welcome the chance to debate in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Topics likely to take center stage in the debates include economic issues in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, including unemployment and the energy industry. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former congressman from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> who still claims it as his home, is all too familiar with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> issues such as energy, immigration policy and the business climate, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON>, his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> political director in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` Certainly, with a 40-year association in this state, and with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, he understands what's going on down here,'' <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON> said. Presidential candidates with Southern ties may have the edge in the debates, which come only two days after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the Republican race and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> outdistanced the Democratic field. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, a Democrat, de-emphasized the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses in his strategy, concentrating his efforts on the South. `` With 20 states and about 40 percent of the delegates chosen on that day, it made sense to focus his efforts down here,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurkovich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coordinator for the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` Being from the region gives him an understanding of the people and concerns. That gives him a certain edge.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was dead last in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> after pulling his campaign out of that state last year. `` This is our chance to counter <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and say those two states are too big for their britches and their britches are not all that big at that,'' <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said. The debates are sponsored by The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, KERA-TV and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION> magazine. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON>, a special correspondent on `` The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour'' and former co-anchor of `` NBC Nightly News,'' will moderate. All the candidates are expected to take part in the debate. `` Besides those issues, what's important is how these guys come across, and it may be that many Texans will now start focusing on the presidential race,'' <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said. `` Texans have said they want to be able to have a say early on who the next president is.''

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has written the seventh encyclical of his papacy, a major document summarizing and updating the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns for social and economic justice. The encyclical, a letter addressed to church leaders, will be released by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Friday. The document is entitled in Latin `` Sollicitudo Rei Socialis,'' meaning the social concern of the church. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> announced the document himself, declaring in a speech in December that it was being written to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the social encyclical `` Populorum Progressio'' -LRB- Development of Peoples -RRB- published by Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> in 1967. That document stressed the needs of Third World countries for a better deal from the developed world. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said the new encyclical would `` reveal the new themes and respond to the new problems'' of social development in the past two decades and that he hoped the document would spur concrete proposals for international cooperation. The <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> said the document is expected to reflect the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s concerns for the excesses of both the free-market capitalist and totalitarian systems and his emphasis on the importance of human values. Throughout his papacy, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has stressed the human element in the productive process, the primacy of people over things. This was the theme of his other major social encyclical, `` On Human Work,'' issued in 1981. During a visit to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1984, he delivered an indictment of unfettered capitalism and urged governments to re-order their economic priorities so that human needs were put before mere financial gain. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was following a tradition that has seen <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> social teaching evolve to respond to the problems spawned by modern industrial society. The encyclical `` Rerum Novarum'' -LRB- Condition of the Working Classes -RRB- issued by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> XIII </PERSON> in 1891 defended the right to hold private property, but insisted that material goods had to meet the needs of all humanity. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>'s 1967 encyclical took this further as it stressed the needs of the Third World and its economic development. The encyclical proposed higher taxes on the rich, regulation of world trade, expropriation of large estates if they impeded general prosperity, and the establishment of a world fund in which some of the money spent on arms would be used to ease poverty in the world. `` Private property does not constitute for anyone an absolute and unconditioned right. No one is justified in keeping for his exclusive use what he does not need, when others lack necessities,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has used his encyclicals to criticize the materialism of communist and capitalist countries, warn that the arms race threatens the destruction of mankind, and to condemn atheism and Marxism. In addition to the encylical on work, the others were titled: `` Christ the Redeemer'' -LRB- 1979 -RRB-, `` The Father of Mercy'' -LRB- 1980 -RRB- `` Apostles of the Slavs'' -LRB- 1985 -RRB-, `` The Holy Spirit, the Giver of Life'' -LRB- 1986 -RRB- and `` The Mother of the Redeemer'' -LRB- 1987 -RRB-.

 This wealthy bedroom community could probably field a celebrity all-star team for any sporting event, but its days in Little League competition may be numbered because of a shortage of adult volunteers. `` It seems to be a combination of parents being busy and a little lazy,'' said Little League President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Arcudi </PERSON>, who has been involved in the sport for 14 years. `` We've only asking for a few hours each week for a 14-week season. I've never seen such a lack of interest.'' <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, a community 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is home to a number of celebrities, including actors <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorshin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>; and writers A.E. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Deford </PERSON>, as well as executives who commute to the city. <PERSON> Arcudi </PERSON> said he plans to hold a meeting on the league's future in mid-March to try to attract volunteers. He said he needs at least 10 more people to fill jobs such as coaches and equipment managers for the town's program, which serves more than 330 boys age 7 to 12. `` If not enough people come forward, there will be no Little League,'' <PERSON> Arcudi </PERSON> said. `` A reduced season is not any good because kids do n't learn what they should in that amount of time.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Keever </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, with headquarters in illiamsport, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said he has not heard of another community in the country whose Little League program is in jeopardy. There are about 2.5 million children ages 7 to 18 who participate in <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in 28 countries, he said. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, there are 34,900 Little League players on 2,500 teams. <PERSON> Keever </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>'s situation `` too bad'' because the youngsters `` are the ones to suffer.'' `` If apathy is the reason, it's going to take a localized effort to make people realize the benefits of the program so it does not go down the drain,'' <PERSON> Keever </PERSON> said. `` Our program is founded upon volunteers. Without them, we're nothing.'' `` Little League is not dying,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Westport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>. `` Our enrollment is up and we are not bankrupt. There are just not enough parent volunteers to run the organization.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surprising showing in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary marks a volatility in voter decision-making that may continue to trouble pollsters as the 1988 campaign unfolds, analysts said Wednesday. Pre-election polls released as late as Tuesday morning generally missed the extent of the last-minute swing that gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his 9-point victory over <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, they said. Most surveys had indicated a dead heat. `` It's the timing and the volatility of this. Nothing is anchored,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, whose final <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> poll had put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 8 points behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` There's a lot of bouncing around.'' The problem is an old one for pollsters: Their surveys are out of date as soon as they are completed, and can not account for voter turnout or for very late changes brought about by advertising or campaign organization. `` For many years there has been a feeling that pre-primary polling is hazardous to one's health, in the early states in particular. This year, on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side, that's how it was,'' said <PERSON> Laurily </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, pollster for NBC News. `` People change their minds, and you ca n't poll for that.'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> and others noted that the polls had correctly tracked trends in the race, if not anticipating the precise outcome. All showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> well ahead last month, then slipping badly after <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> beat him in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses Feb. 8. They had <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> taking a narrow lead by Friday, then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rebounding to a thin edge during the weekend and Monday. `` The tracking polls understated the size of his win. But tracking polls are only an indication of expectations beforehand,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitofsky </PERSON>, polling chief for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` The thing that polls can do best is show you direction. It showed the direction, the movement to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the last few days.'' The final <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> survey, done Sunday and Monday, had a 4-point lead for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 34 to 30 for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>; The final result was within the survey's margin of sampling error of 6 points. The last <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, with results from Saturday through Monday, had it 32 to 30 for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> had it 31-30 for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Herald-WBZ poll had it 32-30 for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. NBC News eschewed late polling. The greatest gap was for Gallup, whose last poll, done from Friday to 4 p.m. Sunday, had <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> with 35 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with 27. <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said the dichotomy between that poll and the Bush-Dole result would prompt changes at Gallup: later polling, if possible, and greater sensitivity to the vagaries of candidates' support. In retrospect, <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said, two-thirds of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backers had told Gallup they supported the vice president strongly, while only half of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s supporters said they felt strongly about him. The finding was an indication of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ability to turn out his vote, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s weakness in that area. `` We knew <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support was strong and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s was soft, but we did n't put enough emphasis on that,'' <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said. `` The lesson is that even if a front-runner's lead seems stable, it remains vulnerable to last-minute changes if it is soft. Not pointing that out was a real failure on our part.''

 Rival political groups clashed during regional elections in <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION> province, and rebels ambushed a police patrol in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>. At least 33 people were killed in the incidents, the government said Wednesday. Suspected communist rebels killed eight Philippine Constabulary troopers and wounded 10 others in <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> province during the Tuesday ambush, a constabulary report said. It said one rebel was believed killed but his body was carried away by his comrades. The government-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said at least 25 people were killed and 50 others injured during fighting in <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION> that began three days prior to last Monday's regional elections. The military sent 4,000 troops, helicopters and warships to the province to guard against election violence. <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION> was the last province to hold regional balloting that began Jan. 18 but was delayed by political violence. Also Wednesday, Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavesh </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he did not believe his embassy was the target of a grenade that exploded Tuesday night outside the building in which his embassy is located. The embassy is on an upper floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building in suburban <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>. Police said the grenade broke windows but caused no injuries. Another grenade that failed to explode was found on the ground floor. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Communist rebels threatened earlier this month to retaliate against Israelis in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> because of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s purported support for the government's anti-insurgency campaign. Israeli diplomats deny their country is involved in the fight against the rebels. Also on Wednelsday, an underground organization of pro-rebel priests and nuns accused the Roman Catholic church of abandoning its mission to serve the poor by supporting President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s `` total war policy'' against communist insurgents. `` By giving blessings to the total war policy of the U.S.-Aquino regime, the reactionary church leadership betrayed us all whom they are supposed to serve,'' the Christians for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> said in an advertisement in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. The group is a branch of the communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The statement followed recent charges by Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, that communists had infiltrated the church's social welfare agency.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he is `` absolutely convinced'' the presidential campaign strategy that carried him to victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> will work in the South. `` We stayed on those issues. We do n't have to change a single thing,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told campaign staff workers a day after beating Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, his chief rival for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied he had misstated <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s positions on taxes, an oil-import fee and arms control in negative ads that flooded <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s airwaves. After he finished behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in the Feb. 8 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> revamped his basic stump approach and scrapped a heavy-security campaign style to mix and mingle with voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, the first primary state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also sought in the days before Tuesday's balloting to avoid direct clashes with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, although his commercials charged <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> straddled the fence on several issues. Asked to respond to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s claim that he had lied about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader's record, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I think I said it was n't true, but I'll be glad to.'' `` You all want me to talk about Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. I want to talk about the issues,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You want to talk about history. I want to talk about the future.'' `` I'm not going to dwell on it,'' he said. `` You see, I do n't want to be drawn into something like that Keep it -LRB- the campaign -RRB- on a high plane. Talk about the issues. People in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> like clean campaigns and they endorsed me overwhelmingly.'' `` The system worked. You can take them in the chin, you can get up and you can fight again,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` So now, go on to Super Tuesday. We're going to fight hard.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented to reporters as he prepared to leave Thursday on the first of several trips into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, the focal point of the Super Tuesday competition. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tentatively planned trips to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Thursday, while aides spoke of a possible trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on the same day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes to win the March 5 primary in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, giving him a boost as he heads into the March 8 round of 16 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries and caucuses _ with 700 delegates at stake _ including a dozen primaries in the South. There will be 2,277 delegate votes at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> national convention, with 1,139 needed to win the nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he felt the `` grass-roots'' campaign approach used in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> would appeal to voters in the South. But he also said `` we're taking nothing for granted. We're going to take a positive message _ a message that was good in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and is just as good. ... It's just as good as we go South. I'm absolutely convinced of that.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokeswoman, said the vice president will continue his new-look campaign strategy of meeting and greeting voters. `` A lot more people to people,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ship Runs Aground; Iran Says U.S. Cutback is `Defeat'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Japanese-owned auto carrier ran aground in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and although there were initial fears it had struck a mine, divers determined it had only scraped its bottom. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, meanwhile, reacted to the announced cutback in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces in the region by saying the move represented a defeat for American `` militaristic policy.'' At a news conference, <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> confirmed that the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and two escort vessels had left the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in recent days and the helicopter carrier <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> was about to depart from the gulf. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the pullout showed `` the ineffectiveness of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policies in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> ... and the disgraceful defeat of futile military moves carried out in support of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> regime and reactionary Arab countries and in the form of direct action against -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s -RRB- Islamic revolution.'' It said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was searching for a way to withdraw without losing face for itself or its European allies, a reference to the five countries that joined last year's buildup of forces to protect commercial shipping from Iranian mines and attacks. The 4,842-ton motor vessel Prosper World was heading out of the gulf after delivering a cargo of new cars when it ran aground. Initial reports from shipping sources in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> quoted the captain of the Liberian-flag ship as reporting an explosion and oil leak. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> later said flatly that the Prosper World had `` hit a mine'' 12 miles off the coast. Divers who inspected the ship informed its captain, a South Korean, that he had `` just run aground, and the whole bottom plate was wrinkled.'' The ship, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Masumoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hyogo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, was believed in no danger and was heading for a drydock for further inspection and repairs, the sources said. No vessel is reported to have struck a mine in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since the small ocean survey ship Marissa I, flying the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> flag, was blown up off <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Sept. 4. Four crew members died. Since then, senior officers of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western navies have declared the threat from mines sown by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` under control'' and have ordered a reduction in the number of mine-hunting vessels in the gulf. <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON>, in his meeting with reporters, disclosed that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, for the first time in recent memory, had used one of its U.S.-supplied F-14 Tomcats in a combat role, shooting down an Iraqi fighter-bomber with an American-made Sidewinder missile. Previous F-14 activity had been limited to reconnaissance, he said. The F-14 was one of 10 remaining from the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>'s air force. <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> gave no details, but it apparently was involved in a dogfight on Feb. 8, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed it shot down three Iraqi jets.

 The uncle of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday said he expects his nephew will act like an officer and a gentleman. `` He loves his country. He is capable of standing up as well as an ordinary man will under the circumstances. ... I do n't think they could bring enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his country in any way. I think he would die first,'' said <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON>, uncle of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, was extremely ill in a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> hospital Wednesday. His sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, was with the elder <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and asked not to be disturbed. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had come home this fall on emergency leave to visit his father. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, was on temporary detail serving as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was kidnapped in the late afternoon on the coastal highway between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s southernmost port of Tyre and the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, site of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force's headquarters. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' family lived in <LOCATION> Garrard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> when he was born and later moved to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, where he was graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1963. Much of his leisure time was spent with his uncle. `` He fished a lot with me. He drove me from time to time. He drove me to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> once, to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, down south a couple of times. We were pretty close together as he grew up,'' said <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON>, 86, a former circuit court judge. `` Yes, he wanted to be in the military service. He always talked about wanting to go to the military service. He wanted to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>,'' Eagle said. He was appointed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, but elected instead to study at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ROTC scholarship. He was commissioned a 2nd lietenant when he graducated in 1967, with a business degree. He later earned masters' degrees in human resources management at <ORGANIZATION> Pepperdine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and in political science at <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. A high school friend said students at Southern were surprised when <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> went into the Marines. `` You think of the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> as being macho-type, and he really was n't like that. But he seems to have done all right at it,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, now a lab technician at <ORGANIZATION> Rohm </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. `` He was involved in a lot of social activities, played football and was one of the top students in the class,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` Just pretty much an average guy.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, an assistant principal at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was a math teacher there when <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> attended and was also a neighbor. `` He was a top student and very active in school. He played on the football team. He came from a good family and was well liked,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. Eagle said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was more studious than athletic but was a boy who `` liked to hunt and fish and romp in the woods.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is married to Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who works at the Pentagon.

<TEXT>
 With the biggest primary day in history three weeks away, presidential campaigns are hoarding their cash and searching for more to pay for campaigning and television advertising time in the 20 Super Tuesday states. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said bluntly on Wednesday that his presidential campaign can not continue unless he draws more money. By contrast, well-heeled Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has $ 4 million available for the most pivotal date of the 1988 primary season on March 8. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, straining for the Republican nomination against better-funded opponents, said his campaign is in the black and counting on his third-place showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to help boost fund raising. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., who relied on this year's federal matching funds to pay off sizable debts, said Wednesday that money is not a problem for him at this point `` We're raising money at a good clip,'' he said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> will need a good influx to remain competitive with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn. in the South <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is not as flush as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but has already has a big media jump on his opponents, thanks to his strategy of concentrating on the South while his opponents vied on the battlefields of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Last week <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> launched a $ 1 million-plus TV campaign across the country. `` We will outspend every other candidate toward Super Tuesday,'' deputy press secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> said. He declined to give an overall spending figure, but said said the campaign has $ 2.2 million in cash on hand and intends to spend a minimum of up to $ 3 million on media alone toward Super Tuesday. He said the current <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> commercials, featuring a biographical message, are running in 14 South and border states and nationwide on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and other cable stations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has concentrated considerable resources on the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has $ 4 million in the bank, deputy press secretary <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON> said Wednesday. He said the campaign's media buys had not been decided yet for Super Tuesday, but that several fund-raising events are scheduled and, `` We have the resources to go the distance.'' Despite <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s successful fund-raising events in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last week, where $ 140,000 was raised on the heels of his second-place finish in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, his campaign has debts of nearly $ 500,000, said his press secretary, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. `` I have to win either in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and we have to get additional campaign contributions. Those two things have to be there, otherwise, I'm going to have to withdraw,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> later tried to paint the financial picture more positively. He said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> hoped to raise $ 150,000 at four events in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. Another event was planned Thursday morning in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, and a `` very, very good'' response was coming from the 48,000 solicitation telegrams the campaign sent out to capitalize on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> results, he said. `` These two weeks are shaping up to be record-breaking for the campaign,'' in terms of money, <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> said, estimating a total of up to $ 600,000 might be raised. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who is to announce Thursday whether he will continue his struggling presidential bid, will end up about $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 in debt if he drops out now, said his press spokesman <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON>. He said the campaign has about $ 30,000 in cash on hand, and that contributions `` slowed to a trickle'' after <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s poor showing in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses last week. `` After <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, it's going to be worse,'' he said. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> ended the year seriously in debt but said his campaign has raised $ 300,000 a week for the past five weeks, and is now operating in the black, thanks also to some $ 3.9 million in federal matching funds he received since Jan. 1. He said he intends to hit up his list of 110,000 contributors in a fund-raising push for Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday could mean budget-watching of a different type, with the well-heeled Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and former TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> budgeting to keep spending low enough so they can save their big cash caches for states that come later. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has raised $ 20.4 million so far and has a series of fund-raisers scheduled to reach the campaign's goal of $ 33 million, said treasurer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Although the campaigns are limited by law to $ 27 million in overall primary campaign spending, legal and accounting costs are exempted from the limit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with $ 8 million in the bank, is not worried about the cap, however, said spokeswoman Ede Holiday. Although he had spent more than $ 13 million by the end of the year, only $ 7.9 million was applicable against the ceiling. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was well-situated with $ 4.1 million in available cash and no outstanding debts, said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Archie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, on the other hand, had spent $ 12.4 million against the cap, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spent $ 9.5 million against it by the end of 1987. Well-funded campaigns must budget carefully so they can spend enough on the later states without going over the $ 27 million limit.

 Soviet firefighters overseen by Americans extinguished a fire Wednesday in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, the aging building the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been unable to abandon because of bugging devices that riddle a new structure. About 150 embassy employees were evacuated and sent home for the day, embassy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said. No one was injured. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said Soviet firefighters were called to put out the fire in an unoccupied fifth-floor residential section after they decided embassy personnel could n't extinguish it on their own. The Soviets responded promptly and were `` escorted at all times by American employees,'' inside the building, said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, who briefed reporters in the wet snow outside the mustard-colored embassy's main door after the fire had been brought under control. The 10-story embassy building, on busy Tchaikovsky Street near the center of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, has been the source of controversy for more than a year. Last spring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they had determined a new eight-story red-brick office building directly behind the old one could not be occupied immediately because of Soviet listening devices apparently installed during construction. The $ 191 million structure already was five years behind schedule at the time. Proposals have included razing part or all of the new structure, or building a new office to house communications and secret operations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said in April that the old embassy building rented by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the early 1950s was a `` firetrap and unsafe by accepted standards for general working conditions. A renovation of the building has been under way since then. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said the fire `` might be construction related,'' although its cause has not been determined. It apparently started near a stairwell, he said. He said there was no damage to the main working areas of the embassy, which begins on the sixth floor. Embassy Second Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, who was in his eighth-floor office at the time of the blaze, said the smell of smoke increased before he evacuated. `` Somebody came through shouting excitedly, ` There's a fire, everybody out of the building!''' <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said. He said he locked up his safe and left the building by a stairs that normally is closed. `` The lower I went, the more smoke I could see,'' he said. `` People were excited, but there was an orderly exit,'' <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said. Embassy employees gathered in the rear courtyard to watch the blaze. `` Flames were leaping out of the building. Obviously it was a very hot fire, and it was coming out of one window,'' <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> was away from the embassy at the time but was alerted and returned to the site, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said. Last fall, employees underwent fire drills conducted by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts, <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kononov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s fire chief, told the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency that firefighters responded in four minutes to a call from one of the Soviet guards who are stationed outside the embassy. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guards `` would n't let us in for about five minutes more: they were apparently waiting for clearance from senior officials.'' Firefighters found `` three rooms and a small hallway with traces of uncompleted repairs were on fire, with flames enveloping tables, chairs and construction garbage,'' he said, adding that it was extinguished in 20 minutes. A more serious fire hit the top floors of the building in 1977, and officials said afterward the damage was severe because Ambassador <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Toon </PERSON> refused to permit Soviet firefighters to enter the top-security embassy communications center and some of its most sensitive work areas. Last spring, a scandal erupted around charges that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine guards had permitted Soviet agents inside secret areas of the embassy. The charges never were proven, but Marine Sgt. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON> was convicted in August of espionage for giving the Soviets embassy floor plans and the identities of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents after he had become sexually involved with a Soviet woman.

<HEAD>Education Minister Whose Policies Sparked Protests Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Savary </PERSON>, whose policies as education minister in 1984 caused street protests and a change in Socialist governments, died Wednesday at age 69. A <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> statement said <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> had been hospitalized for several weeks with a serious infection, but did not give the cause of death. <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> proposed a bill in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 to carry out President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s campaign promises to revamp the system of private education. Among its provisions, the complex reform bill gave local authorities more control over management and finances of private schools. It also gave teachers in those schools the option of retaining their status or choosing civil service status, and linked state subsidies to the number of teachers who preferred the change. Nearly 16 percent of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 12 million school children attend private schools, of which 94 percent are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and heavily subsidized by the state. The Savary Law inflamed passions for months. Opponents felt it threatened their right to choose how their children would be educated. Supporters wanted to hold <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to his promise to create `` a unified, secular public education service.'' More than 1 million people joined daylong demonstrations across <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on June 24, 1984. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON>, then premier, said the reforms had been `` totally misunderstood'' but the Socialists withdrew the bill. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenment </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Savary </PERSON> as education minister and <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON> gave way as premier to <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabius </PERSON>. <PERSON> Savary </PERSON>, who was in the French Resistance during World War II, had a reputation for being soft-spoken but stubborn. He was a leader in the government formed just after liberation and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, and held ministerial positions under President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> and in other governments. Born April 25, 1918, in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, then a French colony, he was a strong advocate of decolonization of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday: `` He represented socialism, with his strong sense of morality, his sense of justice and his commitment to the decolonization.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production edged up 0.2 percent in January despite big declines in auto production and steel, the government said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said that the January increase was just half the 0.4 percent gain recorded in both November and December. Private analysts said this slower growth was consistent with their view that the economy will slow considerably in the early part of 1988 as businesses work off a backlog of unsold inventories built up during the final three months of 1987. Strength in domestic production helped push the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, to a robust annual growth rate of 4.2 percent from October through December. However, nearly three-fourths of that strength went into inventories rather than final sales. Analysts said this backlog will have to be worked off in coming months and will translate into an extremely sluggish economy in the first three months of this year. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a private forecasting firm, said that the smaller rise in industrial production was consistent with this view. `` We are seeing a slowdown in domestic demand, not only for cars, but other consumer durables and this will hold down industrial production even though we are getting some offsetting strength from stronger export sales,'' he said. Some economists are predicting GNP growth could be an actual negative number from January though March, but most expect growth will resume in the spring, keeping the country out of a recession. `` We are seeing that while the economy is slowing down, things are not stopping. We think we will have sluggish growth in the first half of the year but no recession,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, senior financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The January increase in industrial production, the fourth in a row, left output 6 percent above where it was a year ago, providing further evidence of the rebound manufacturers are enjoying as the weaker dollar boosts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to record levels. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is counting on the export strength to keep the country out of a recession this year. Output in the manufacturing sector rose 0.2 percent in January following a much larger 0.5 percent December advance. The strength came from industries producing non-durable goods, where production rose by 0.4 percent. Output of durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, showed no change at all in January. Production of cars fell by 7.4 percent in January to an annual rate of 6.5 million units. The impact of this fall was offset in part, however, by an increase in production of light trucks and mini-vans, which have now captured about one-third of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer market. Also contributing to the weakness last month was a decline in iron and steel production, which fell back following a sharp rise in December. The mining industry suffered a 0.6 percent drop in January, the second consecutive monthly downturn. This sector, which includes oil and gas well drilling, has been battered by depressed conditions caused by falling world energy prices. The utility sector had a big 1.3 percent increase in January, reflecting colder-than-normal weather which drove up the use of electricity and natural gas. The various changes left the industrial production index at 133.8 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

<HEAD>Court: Humane Society May Sue To Stop Hunting On Federal Preserves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Tuesday revived a lawsuit challenging the expansion of hunting on federal wildlife preserves when it ruled the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> had legal standing to bring the case. A three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here overturned a district judge's finding that the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lacked the requisite legal standing to sue the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to stop hunting on nine federal wildlife preserves. `` The gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting on wildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpses and environmental degradation, in addition to depleting the supply of animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view,'' the court said in an opinion written by Judge <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, chief judge. `` These are classic aesthetic interests, which have always enjoyed protection under standing analysis,'' <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who represented the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, called the decision significant because `` it confirms that environmental groups like the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> have the right to bring actions based on their members' concerns about harms to their aesthetic interests.'' An appellate decision upholding the dismissal of the lawsuit by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> `` would have made it difficult for any wildlife group to bring suit for the protection of wildlife,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. While ruling the society had a legal right to sue, the court upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to allow waterfowl hunting on <LOCATION> Chincoteague </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The appeals court sent the case back to <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> to rule on the merits of the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s claims that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had not properly evaluated the wildlife populations of other preserves before allowing hunting. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a hunters' group, said he was disappointed by the court's decision. But he predicted that hunting would be upheld at the other preserves. `` On a single refuge, the appeals court said that everything was proper in permitting hunting. Assumedly that would apply to all other refuges,'' <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A note purportedly written by the kidnappers of two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief workers said Wednesday the captives were linked to an intelligence agency and would be freed only if proven innocent of espionage. The Swedish foreign minister disputed the allegations in the letter. The note, handwritten in Arabic and delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said hostages <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> would be released `` only after they are proven innocent from the charges against them.'' `` We announce to everybody that Swede <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> and Norwegian <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> are involved with the secret service of a foreign country and this is becoming clear through investigation of them,'' it said. The two employees of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which cares for Palestine refugees, were abducted by gunmen on Feb. 5 near the south <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The relief agency blamed the abduction on Palestinians acting individually without political motivations or links to any organization. Palestinian leaders have denounced the kidnappings. The note, which did not identify the kidnappers or give a date, carried what were said to be the thumbprints and signatures of Stening and <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>. A similiar note said on Saturday the kidnappers were interrogating them but made no specific accusations against them. `` We remind everybody we are not aiming at causing harm to our steadfast people. We appreciate the services of -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> agency -RRB- and call on them to be patient until the time comes for us to reveal all the information,'' the note said. `` We tell everyone who claims he is able to release them within a specific time or that the whereabouts of the hostages is known that their release will only take place when they are proved innocent of the charges against them,'' the statement said. Swedish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said the information in the letter `` is incorrect and false.'' `` One reason for this is that Stening, with an impeccable service record in both <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and UNWRA, not could have lent himself to anything like that,'' he said. `` Secondly I think the kidnappers need a motive that can be accepted by those who put pressure on them to release the hostages. That's why they make this up. This is a product of fantasy.''

<HEAD>Lawyer Rights Apply To Breath Test Requests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday that a motorist arrested on a drunken driving charge must be given a chance to call a lawyer before deciding whether to take a breath test. An arrested driver has a right under the Oregon Constitution to a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice before deciding whether to submit to a breath test, the court said in a unanimous decision. The court, noting that evidence of blood-alcohol content dissipates with time, said police are n't required to wait for a long period of time before administering the test. But the opinion did n't hand down any iron-clad rules on what will amount to a `` reasonable'' time to allow motorists to contact attorneys. A footnote to the opinion said, however, `` A period of 15 minutes after the request to take the test has been made will doubtless suffice in most cases.'' The decision was the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s third in seven years on the issue of whether suspected drunken drivers have a right to legal advice before making a decision on a breath test. Refusing to take a breath test carries an automatic 120-day driver's license suspension under state law. In 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said in a 4-3 ruling that arrested drivers were entitled to consult atorneys before deciding on breath tests. A divided court in 1981 overruled that decision, saying denial of access to legal counsel did n't require supression of breath test evidence. The court Wednesday overturned that decision, basing its ruling on a provision in the state constitution giving anyone accused of a crime a right to obtain legal counsel. `` The evanescent nature of the evidence the police seek -LRB- from breath tests -RRB- may justify substantially limiting the time in which the person may exercise his or her ... right, but it does not justify doing away with it,'' the court said in an opinion by Justice <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>. As a result, defendant <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>'s breath test findings ca n't be used as evidence against him. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> was arrested by a <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy on May 4, 1985, and taken to the county jail. His request to consult a lawyer before deciding on a breath test was refused. His case was returned to the district court for trial.

 <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told an acquaintance `` we have kidnapped a West German'' after a foreign businessman was abducted in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> last year, according to testimony Wednesday in <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with the January 1987 kidnapping of <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another West German in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The abductions were allegedly carried out to pressure <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who is being held in connection with the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in which an American sailor died. Federal investigator <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruefer </PERSON> testified that an acquaintance of <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hamsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON>, told police the defendant informed him that <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> had been kidnapped. According to a police statement, <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as saying by telephone from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, `` We have kidnapped a West German.'' Excerpts of <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON>'s statement to police were read on Wednesday. In one excerpt, <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told him that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested because `` He was one of the kidnappers of the American <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'' jetliner. <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON> told police that <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> made that statement Jan. 14, 1987, one day after his 23-year-old brother was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport carrying explosives. The following week, <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another West German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Last week, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was not among the gunmen who kidnapped him from his <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hotel Jan. 20. He said <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was older and taller than the men who abducted him. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released in September in what his kidnappers said was a goodwill gesture. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> is still being held. Last year, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for the extradition of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. West German authorities last week charged him with murder and air piracy, the same charges he would have faced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A trial date has not been set. A third West German citizen, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Schray </PERSON>, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> three weeks ago in an apparent attempt to increase pressure on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to release the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brothers.

 <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> says he has appropriated <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s dilemma: `` To be or not to be.'' The former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor was talking Wednesday about the possibility of ending his two-year, long-shot presidential bid. He said he would give his answer on Thursday, but fellow <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was already angling for his support if he should drop out. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> aides said privately that he was unlikely to endorse anyone, at least for now. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> finished sixth of the seven major candidates in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary, edging <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> by less than a thousand votes. At a news conference before flying to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> told reporters, `` I wo n't waste your time playing Hamlet for more than 24 hours, but I'm sure going to do it for 24 hours.'' He said he would make up his mind after speaking with advisers and his family. In the closing days of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> had appealed directly to voters to keep his campaign alive. He talked Wednesday of the possibility of staying in the race to try to force debate among the Democratic contenders, to make them face up to issues such as the federal budget deficit. `` There will be a lot more debates,'' he said, `` and all you need to get into those debates and keep people honest and talk about the future is the price of a plane ticket. Even <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> can raise the price of a plane ticket.'' In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, `` There are some mornings, you know, I wake up in a Motel Six in some small town that I do n't even know the name of. I'm on the phone that night to my kids _ obviously they miss me, I've been away too long. Those are the down moments. Then you're on the phone begging for money to meet the payroll and you say, ` Why did I ever get into this?''' Despite these regrets, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> retained the optimism that has driven his candidacy for two years. `` There are worse things than losing,'' he said. `` The worst thing of all would be to lose having had nothing to say, not having made a difference.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> has urged him to stay in the race and that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has asked for his support if he quits. He and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` share a lot of experience'' from the 1960s, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, including the civil rights movement. But he said he told <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> his request was premature. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, it's awfully early,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> quoted himself as saying. `` I'm not ready to make any decision.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who finished fourth in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, said Wednesday, `` I hope I gain his support.'' A <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> endorsement `` would obviously broaden the base of my campaign,'' he said. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> showing was worse than his finish in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, where he was fifth.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> agreed Wednesday to a truce and disengagement in a disputed, sparsely populated border area where hundreds of their soldiers have been killed since November. The agreement was reached after two days of talks in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> between military teams led by <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Chaovalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyuth </PERSON>, and the Laotian chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Sisavat </PERSON> <PERSON> Keobounphan </PERSON>. `` We have agreed to end the fighting and stop the bloodshed,'' <PERSON> Sisavat </PERSON> told reporters. `` Gen. <PERSON> Chaovalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyuth </PERSON> and I have agreed that, from now on, our supreme commands will wage no more war, end all clashes in the air, along rivers and along the <LOCATION> Laos-Thai </LOCATION> border. Let that border represent friendship and peace.'' <PERSON> Chaovalit </PERSON> told a separate news conference the talks created `` a basis for the establishment of improved ties. In the future, force will not be used to settle differences. Let the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> -LRB- boundary -RRB- not only stand for friendship and peace but also signify an important bond.'' A joint statement said the nations `` expressed their sincere determination to put an end to the clashes and bloodshed in the area.'' The small, hilly area in dispute lies between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Phitsanulok </LOCATION> province and the <LOCATION> Sayaboury </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, about 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Bankkok </LOCATION> Both sides claim it on the basis of a 1907 French-Thai treaty and internationally recognized maps. The statement said the cease-fire would begin at 8 a.m. Friday -LRB- 8 p.m. Thursday EST -RRB- and a joint military coordinating group would monitor the truce and disengagement. It said the agreement had created an atmosphere conducive to political negotiations and both delegations would ask their governments to begin talks on resolving the border question within 15 days after the cease-fire starts. Hundreds of soldiers have died in ground and artillery battles and strikes by <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> air force F-5E jet fighter-bombers since the military conflict began in November. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> also claims dozens of Vietnamese were killed fighting on the Laotian side. The four-man Laotian team arrived from <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> on Tuesday after Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> accepted a proposal of talks made by the Laotian premier, <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> <PERSON> Phomvihane </PERSON>. Air Vice Marshal <PERSON> Sommot </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundaravej </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> had suspended air strikes since Tuesday morning because of the negotiations.

 Winning the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary gave little more than bragging rights to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as each came away with just a handful of national convention delegates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who picked up 38 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vote in the primary, gained 11 of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s 23 delegates to the GOP national convention. In all, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now has 61 delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who got 36 percent of the Democratic vote in the Tuesday primary, won nine of the state's 18 pledged delegates to the national convention. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has 44.5 delegates. The lift from the early primaries and caucuses is more psychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1,139 delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination or the 2,082 delegates for the Democratic nomination. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> gained seven delegates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Tuesday to bring his national total to 42, while Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> won three delegates to raise his total to 35. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, the winner of last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses, gained six national convention delegates for his second-place showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> followed with three delegates In the popular vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won 20 percent while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 17 percent. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> now has 39 delegates, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has 33. Under Democratic Party rules, the national convention delegates were awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15 percent of the vote. In effect, that disqualified <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> from receiving any delegates from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 8 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 7 percent, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> 5 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> 4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> have a similar rule, but the threshold is 10 percent. That meant former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who had 10 percent, picked up two delegates, but former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who was within 1,100 votes of du Pont, received no delegates because he had just 9.5 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> already had eight delegates, while du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> had none before Tuesday's primary. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> already had 10.55 delegates, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 9.8 and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> had four. The delegate totals for the Republicans include results from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> both have held <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses, precise delegate figures can not be calculated until later because of the way the selection process is structured. The Democratic totals include results from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, as well as an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members who will serve automatically as delegates to their party's convention. Some of the Democratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention.

<TEXT>
 A leukemia victim's long-lost brother has rejected pleas to determine whether his bone marrow is compatible, dashing the patient's best hope for survival. `` If he dies, he dies. He's about as much a brother to me as you are,'' <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> told a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, 31, ran away from home when he was 17 and lives on the streets here, working as a test subject for medical experiments. He refused to undergo tests that would check if he could donate marrow to his brother, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Oolitic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> has another brother and sister who have already been tested and found incompatible. The older brother suffers from acute leukemia and said he will die within two years unless a marrow transplant succeeds. He is now receiving blood transfusions and chemotherapy at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> While his leukemia is in remission, his doctor said a marrow transplant should be performed within four months. After reading an earlier News article about <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s efforts to locate his brother in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a friend of the younger <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> called the newspaper and told them <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s whereabouts A reporter found <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> at the downtown <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Public Library Tuesday. `` I'm not even going to consider it,'' he said of the marrow donation request. `` If I sound cruel, well, that's the way I feel. I'm not a very forgiving person.'' He said testing to see if his marrow is compatible with his brother's might interfere with a drug experiment in which he is going to participate starting Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's how I make my living,'' he said. Contacted at his hospital room, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said his brother's decision disappointed him `` He must have turned into a hard person,'' he said. `` I guess that's what living on the street does to you. I thought he would at least try to help, but that's the way things go.''

<HEAD>NH Results Raise Spectre Of Deadlocked Convention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s primary results produced a new flurry of speculation on Wednesday that the Democratic presidential campaign might end without a clear winner, leading to a deadlocked nominating convention next summer. But Democratic party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> predicted, `` we're going to have a first-ballot winner'' among the current contenders. It was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> who responded to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> returns by saying that delegates to the Democratic convention would draft either <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. `` I believe there will be a draft,'' he said. `` The strategy, which was not a strategy to begin with but which is working marvelously, is not to come in but to be drafteed at the convention.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has consistently said he is not interested in entering the 1988 presidential race, while <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said he is not a candidate but has not flatly ruled out a late entry. The governor on Wednesday had kind words for virtually all the seven Democratic contenders, but told reoporters it was still `` too early'' for him to bestow his endorsement on any of them. `` There's a long way to go,'' he said. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s support has been sought avidly by several of the Democratic hopefuls in advance of the April 19 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scored a decisive triumph in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, with <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> a distant second and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> just behind him in third place. The outcome, which had been expected, left the field without a clear front-runner and with a crowded roster of candidates heading into the delegate-rich primaries and caucuses ahead. But <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, speaking with reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` the players who are on the field, that's where the game's going to be won.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said he had no doubt the field of candidates would begin to shrink as the primary season runs its course. `` I do n't believe for a minute that you'll have six candidates running neck and neck right down to the convention. As we move down to the final innings, you'll see signs of a final person emerging,'' he said. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign manager, political consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, said he thought it appeared less and less likely that any of the seven Democratic candidates would arrive at the nominating convention with enough delegates to claim a victory on the first ballot. `` I believe there will be brokering,'' he said, meaning that the front-running candidates at convention time would need alliances with their rivals for enough delegate support to win. But he said that did n't mean a draft candidate emerging. `` If they're going to negotiate with anybody they'll negotiate with each other,'' he said of the current contenders.

 Motorcycle and moped riders in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> will be required to wear helmets starting next year under a controversial bill passed in the Legislature Wednesday.

<HEAD>After 17 Weeks, Westies Racketeering Case Goes to the Jury</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury began deliberating racketeering charges Wednesday against six men and two women accused of belonging to the Westies, a gang of thugs that allegedly terrorized <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hell </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Kitchen </LOCATION> neighborhood for 20 years. The case, which has featured graphic accounts of killings and dismemberments, went to the jury after nearly four months of testimony and more than a week of closing arguments. The panel worked for about 4 -LCB- hours before breaking off deliberations for the night. A 14-count racketeering indictment charged the eight defendants were members of a criminal enterprise that seized control of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> neighborhood and held sway there for nearly two decades through a series of killings and other violent crimes. Prosecutors also contended the Westies trafficked in drugs, counterfeit money and stolen goods, engaged in loansharking and extortion and killed people who got in their way. Prosecutors <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> said the Westies had committed a series of killings that included dismembering the victims' bodies in order to enhance their reputation and eliminate competitors. The indictment listed the names of 10 alleged co-conspirators who had been killed before the charges were brought in March. The defense argued most of the evidence is based on the uncorroborated testimony of informers who were themselves killers, thieves and drug dealers. The main prosecution witness, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON>, said he had been `` the right-hand man'' of reputed Westies boss <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON>, who has admitted committing three homicides himself, testified he helped <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> conduct a loansharking business and was present at a 1978 meeting when the Westies agreed to work with the Gambino organized crime family. He also linked <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> to the killing and dismemberment of a recalcitrant loanshark customer. On cross-examination by <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shargel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Featherstone </PERSON> acknowleged being in and out of mental hospitals in the 1970s, lying under oath in the past and suffering psychotic episodes. <PERSON> Shargel </PERSON> and other defense lawyers also denied even the existence of an organization called the Westies. Even government witnesses conceded the name Westies was created by the police and news media to describe a group of mainly Irish-American hoodlums on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON>, and his wife <PERSON> Edna </PERSON>, 44, both of <LOCATION> Hazlet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> the defendants are: <PERSON> James </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, 42; <PERSON> William </PERSON> `` Indian'' <PERSON> Bokun </PERSON>, 30; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Halo </PERSON>, 36; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> `` <LOCATION> Muggsy </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, 50; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 53, and his wife, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, 52, all of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. All face a maximum penalty of 20 years each if convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy, the most serious charges.

 An additional 500,000 metric tons of subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat has been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The sale, equal to about 18.3 million bushels, was handled by <ORGANIZATION> Artfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000 tons; and <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 tons. At recent prices averaging $ 2.82 per bushel, the wheat would have a farm value of about $ 52 million. Nearly 5.7 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, for delivery in the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said an additional 1.2 million tons of wheat are still available to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under current <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> authorization Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so they can sell a foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive world prices. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the subsidies, or bonuses, averaged $ 27.48 per ton on the latest sales, or about 75 cents per bushel. The subsidies for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been available only for wheat. The sales also are part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a long-term agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30. According to the agreement, the annual purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans, or 39.4 bushels of corn. In addition, 1.67 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, 800,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by the Soviets for delivery this year.

 Leaders of white supremacist groups gathered in 1983 to discuss poisoning the water supplies of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and establishing an Aryan nation in the place of the present <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, federal prosecutors charged Wednesday. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> outlined the meeting in his opening statement to jurors hearing the trial of 14 men, all linked with supremacist groups, charged with conspiring to overthrow the government or kill federal officials. Defense attorneys contended that the issue in the trial was freedom of speech. One of the defendants, presenting his own opening statement, told the jury, `` You're about to get a great civics lesson.'' A jury of 12 whites was selected for the trial Tuesday. Because the trial is expected to last about three months, Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> seated six alternate jurors, rather than the usual two. According to <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, who is in prison, discussed a poisoning scheme in 1983 at an Aryan Nations convocation in <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, are among 10 defendants charged with seditious conspiracy, which is conspiring to overthrow the government by force. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, while Miles is a former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> official convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school buses in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, whose name is on the government's list of witnesses, is the former leader of an Arkansas-based militaristic supremacist group named The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord Officials raised the group's compound in 1985 and seized weapons and a 39-gallon drum of sodium cyanide. At the time of the 1983 meeting, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> had more than 200 pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. At that same conclave, several supremacist leaders discussed the idea of abolishing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and setting up an Aryan state, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader and another of the defendants, told the 1983 conference that the time had come for war, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> told his audience that `` the anti-God slithering homosexual'' dwelt in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and warned, `` If you do n't help me kill them ... you're going to have to beg for your child's life, and the answer will be ` no.''' Miles made a speech urging the use of robberies to finance supremacist activities, <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> said, and six holdups during the next 18 months netted supremacists more than $ 4 million. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> `` sent a paper around to be signed,'' and when it came back signed by the leaders, <PERSON> Ellision </PERSON> said, `` All of us today entered into a conspiracy against the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. The prosecutor said no one disagreed with <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>'s statement and `` the meeting ended with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> stiff-arm hail victory salute.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmeister </PERSON>, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, told the jury that freedom of speech was at stake in the trial and quoted the late <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> as saying freedom of speech includes `` freedom for the thought we hate.'' `` The whole nation is watching you,'' <PERSON> Hofmeister </PERSON> said. `` What are the limits of freedom of speech? Even the speech we hate? It is an aweesome responsibility that you have.'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, in his 90-minute statement, said that `` if the government will admit that the Constitution is dead and there is no freedom of speech, I'm guilty. But if our Constitution still exists, I'm not guilty.'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said he was `` under the impression I could say whatever I wanted to say in this country. In fact, at one time I fought for that right. That's why I'm here. Some of my views are unpopular.'' He also contended <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>'s account was a `` good story, but that's all it is'' and he knew nothing about any such conspiracy. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the supremacists viewed whites as the people of God, Jews as `` the spawn of Satan,'' and blacks as sub-human. The government was called ZOG, for Zionist Occupation Government. Two defendants, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Smithville </LOCATION>, enlisted the aid of <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>'s group to murder a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who had been involved in the prosecution of people who harbored tax protestor <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. In 1983, <PERSON> Kahl </PERSON>, wanted in the killings of two federal marshals in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, was killed in a shootout near <LOCATION> Smithville </LOCATION> at a home on land owned by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. The Wades wanted the CSA to take action against Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, the chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> `` to show the people that patriots ca n't be pushed around,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. A group headed out of the <ORGANIZATION> CSA </ORGANIZATION> compound on Dec. 26, 1983, to carry out the killings, but backed out after a van in which four of them were riding went out of control on a snowy road and collided with a pickup truck, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Union leaders, uncertain which presidential candidate their members like but unwilling to accept Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, are hoping to prevent the Tennessean from upstaging the other Democrats in the Super Tuesday round of primaries in three weeks. Although <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> carries an 88 percent pro-AFL-CIO lifetime voting record, unusually high for a Southern Democrat and ahead of Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s 83 percent pro-labor record, some union political directors say they are having trouble slating members as <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delegates to the Democratic national convention. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has just 85 union members running as delegates to the convention next July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> from the eight states whose filing deadlines have passed, compared with 255 for Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, according to information provided by six presidential campaigns to the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. Labor delegate totals for the the other five Democratic candidates from all eight states were incomplete, but the figures that were available indicated that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were slating trade unionists in about equal numbers with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> except in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared strongest. More laborites want to be <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delegates, but his campaign is the only one that is actively shunning their support, according to some union political directors. `` He's not going after labor at all,'' complained <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, political director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The people he has running his campaign are 1976 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> types. They're not slating labor people.'' Ms. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who openly favors <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and is one of 42 automatic labor delegates to the convention as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is counting on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to win between four and six of the 20 primaries and caucuses on March 8 to thwart <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s Southern strategy. Labor leaders here are counting on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strong showing in the South to keep <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> out of first or third place in the post-Super Tuesday delegate counts and throw the race into the industrial state contests in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> where unions are strongest. `` As a trade unionist, of course I'd rather see it decided in the industrial states,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgine </PERSON>, president of the federation's 4-million member Building and Construction Trades Department. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Wednesday he can still call the 91 presidents of the federation's member unions together to make a pre-convention endorsement if it appears any one candidate is beginning to garner overwhelming support among union members. `` The essential criteria is the same, at least a two-thirds consensus,'' he said. `` But I'm not going to force it, and I'm not going to invent it either.'' While acknowledging their personal favorites, most union presidents on the federation's 36-member policymaking executive council said none of the candidates has yet to muster that kind of support among their members. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s third largest with 1 million members, doubts there will be an endorsement. `` We ca n't change the fact that no individual has emerged,'' he said. `` Our <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> locals got together and endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but it was n't a very strong endorsement. I would bet that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got a lot of <ORGANIZATION> UFCW </ORGANIZATION> votes in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s early endorsement of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984 helped save his campaign after he lost the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary that year to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. But it also enabled <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s opponents to tag labor as a `` special interest'' candidate and created a backlash among many union members. Exit polls showed only about half the voters from union households pulled the lever for <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in the general election _ far short of the two-thirds majority support that the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> claimed that its endorsement represented. Union leaders here are intent on avoiding a repeat of that. `` We're damned if we do and damned if we do n't,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and head of a coalition of 15 rail unions. `` We may well go into a brokered convention, and that's not a bad thing as far as we're concerned Obviously the best thing to do is not force a consensus.''

<HEAD>Reagan Pork-Barrel Hit List to be Purely Symbolic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hit list for congressional pork-barrel spending will be released next week _ but not as the cutback legislation he promised in his State of the Union address, congressional sources said Wednesday. Instead, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s list of cuts will be made in a symbolic statement of what he would do if granted his longstanding wish for authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills. The cuts would have no legal effect unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes up the cause. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> said she was not certain a decision had been made. But Republiocan sources on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told them this week the list would not be in the form of rescission bills. `` It's going to be a package of suggestions from the president,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. The new strategy could help avoid election-year clashes with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers who won spending projects last year, the aide said. A high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> official said the form of the request was not important, `` It's how much noise you make.'' The official, who demanded annoymity, said in either case he doubted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would go along. The change in tactics appeared to be a retreat from the president's nationally televised address last month. The speech included a pitch for the line-item veto, which would allow him to reach into <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' mammoth spending legislation and cut out items he considered wasteful. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited cranberry, blueberry and crawfish research along with other items that he would cut if given the chance. `` In 30 days, I will send back to you those items, as rescissions, which if I had the authority to line them out, I would do so,'' the president told the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> has been drafting the list, which could total $ 4 billion. Most of the targeted items were contained in the $ 600 billion catchall spending bill approved at the end of last year's session By proposing rescissions, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could freeze spending on those items for 45 days and give procedural advantages to those in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supporting his effort. After the 45-day period, the spending would be restored unless the rescission were approved. Any lawmaker is allowed to propose rescission legislation, but without the president's impetus the path to passage is more difficult.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> focused on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Wednesday in an urgent search for a primary victory, even as he contended second place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was good enough to put him in a two-man Democratic presidential race with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there really is a true front-runner today,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` It's a tough race now, I think, in the rest of the country between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. ... I think that's really what this race is going to boil down to.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spoke as he left <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, for <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, to trumpet an endorsement by Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> in a state where next Tuesday's primary does not guarantee delegates. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s claim to a two-man nomination battle overlooked two other Democratic candidates who have staked much of their hopes and spent much of their time in the looming delegate battleground of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr. It also ignored <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, whose campaign limped into neighboring <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> after back-to-back narrow losses to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s leading rivals were campaigning in the South for much of what is to be a three-week campaign there. His focus instead was on a far less significant state on the primary calender, where the Democratic primary Tuesday is a `` beauty contest'' in which voters state a preference that does not commit convention delegates. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was scheduled to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> during six of the next seven days. He was gambling on a victory that would attract attention and make him look like a winner heading toward March 8 when nearly one-third of the Democratic delegates are at stake. `` I think I can do well here,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said in an interview. `` In order to do that I have to get my message across and see people. `` This is just the way we think the time can be best spent to get the delegates, to get the results, we need,'' he said. He was also contesting <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s caucuses, where 13 delegates are at stake on March 5. `` We're doing a lot of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> shuttling,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s press secretary. She called them gateway states to Super Tuesday and said they `` are very important to us.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> strategists said they decided not to contest three other states holding contests during the next three weeks _ <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> aod <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> figures to be strong, and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> are campaigning. The congressman attended a rally with <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and toured a financially troubled electronics assembly plant in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he attacked unfair trade practices by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has purchased $ 40,000 worth of television commercials in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, a significant amount in the state of just 700,000 people. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are already on the air here. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> polltaker <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> contended that because of intensive television coverage of the candidates whereever they are <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> can campaign in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and still attract attention in the process in the Southern states where so many delegates are at stake. `` Time spent doing media markets in the South is an well-spent in these states _ there will be a focus on these events,'' he said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won 20 percent of the vote Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s leadoff primary, behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who finished with 37 percent It was far from a victory, but <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> celebrated as if it were one because he ran ahead of fellow Midwesterner <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and the rest of the field. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had predicted he would best <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and his third place finish with 18 percent put him in danger of being unable to raise the money necessary to sustain his indebted candidacy. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` will be tough opponents in the South.'' But he portrayed himself as better able to take the battle to the rest of country with his message of foreign trade sanctions and no tax increases for low and middle-income people. Polls have shown <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ran particularly well among blue-collar and union voters in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and he is likely to bid for those voters in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. `` Trade, energy and agriculture are strong issues in the South,'' he said. `` Those are issues I've defined and I think we're going to do well there.

<HEAD>Emissions Of Lead Take Sharp Drop in 1986</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Emissions of lead into the atmosphere took another sharp drop in 1986 due to the reduction of lead in gasoline, according to the annual air pollution report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Though most of the six major pollutants showed only minor changes from the year before, lead emissions fell 59 percent, an even sharper drop than the 47 percent seen the year before, according to the report. Another sharp decline was seen in peak quarterly concentrations measured by the 82 instruments in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s lead monitoring network. The average maximum quarterly reading fell 35 percent. Lead emissions peaked in 1976 at 169,000 tons, of which 146,000 tons came from the gasoline burned in cars and trucks, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s estimates. Starting in 1975, most new cars could not use leaded gasoline because it would disable the new exhaust pollution equipment, and all new cars had to use lead-free gasoline in 1980. Emissions fell to 44,200 tons in 1984, and the following year <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> started its two-year reduction of permissible lead concentrations in gasoline from 1.1 gram per gallon to 0.1 gram. That reduced emissions to 23,300 tons in 1985 and 9,500 tons in 1986. Some major companies have stopped selling leaded gasoline as a smaller number of older cars each year may legally use it. Its share of the market shrank from 31 percent in 1986 to 26 percent in 1987. `` I would predict a continued dramatic improvement'' in next year's annual report, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for air programs. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has proposed removing the last lead from gasoline, but action on that has been stalled by the fears of farmers that they will ruin old but still vital farm engines that need leaded gasoline. Lead is a poison, causing kidney and brain damage in high enough concentrations. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes there is new evidence it raises blood pressure, at least in men. It is also the cheapest way to boost gasoline octane, and before engine manufacturers switched to hardened valve seats in 1971-1975, many engines relied on lead deposits to lubricate valves _ the point that worries farmers. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said 4.5 million people, unchanged from the previous year's report, lived in counties where the airborne lead concentration standard is violated Those violations came near smelters. The report listed these eight cities where the standard of 1.5 micrograms per cubic meter was exceeded for a quarter. The figures are the peak quarterly average, in micrograms per cubic meter, near the smelter and the peak reading in a residential area. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> -LRB- 1.72, 0.14 -RRB-; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> -LRB- 5.70, 0.35 -RRB-; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> -LRB- 2.09, 0.14 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> -LRB- 1.82, 0.26 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> -LRB- 2.49, 0.14 -RRB-; <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> -LRB- 2.30, 0.30 -RRB-; <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. -LRB- 1.81, 0.16 -RRB- and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -LRB- 1.57, 0.58 -RRB-. There were no surprises elsewhere in the report, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it had not changed its estimate that about 100 million people live in counties where one or more concentration standards is violated. Here is a rundown of the other major pollutants, with emissions from 1985 and 1986, followed by average concentrations in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s monitoring networks _ Carbon monoxide, from 70.9 million tons to 67.1 million tons and from 7.19 parts per million to 7.21 parts per million in the second-highest eight-hour average, a blip upward <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> considers no real change at all The standard is 9.0 ppm. Carbon monoxide can worsen heart problems since it displaces oxygen in the blood. _ Sulfur dioxide, from 23.8 million tons to 23.4 million tons and from 88.5 micrograms per cubic meter to 86.4 micrograms averaged over the year The annual standard is 80 micrograms. Sulfur dioxide causes breathing difficulties and can turn into acid rain. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has revised upward slightly its estimates of emissions over the last nine years. _ Volatile organic compounds like unburned gasoline that form ozone, from 22.4 million tons to 21.5 million tons Ozone concentrations fell from 0.127 ppm to 0.123 ppm, measured as the second-highest one-hour reading. _ Nitrogen dioxide, which also causes breathing problems, helps form ozone and can be transformed into acid rain, from 21.7 million tons to 21.3 million tons and from 0.0251 ppm to 0.0248 ppm, measured as an annual average The standard calls for 0.053 ppm. _ Smoke, dust and soot, what <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> calls `` total suspended particulates,'' from 7.7 million tons to 7.5 million tons and from 48.5 micrograms per cubic meter to 48.4 micrograms This is the last year total suspended particulates will be listed as a pollutant. EPA is switching to counting as a pollutant only the fine particles that penetrate the lung.

 The Marine officer kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is one of at least 15 Americans on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty assigned to serve in a land so dangerous for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declared it off-limits in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officers chosen for the duty are under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> command and it has no control over where they serve. Gunmen stopped the car of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, on a south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> road Wednesday and abducted him. Sources in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said he was returning from talks with officials of a moderate Shiite Moslem militia near the port city of Tyre. Twenty-four other foreigners, including eight Americans and two Scandinavian <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials abducted earlier this month, also are missing, most believed to be hostages of Shiite extremists. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, has been held longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is one of 17 Americans in the 76-person truce observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>. The Pentagon put the number of Americans at 15 or 16, and neither could account for the discrepancy. Not all observers are on duty at a given time. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said only six Americans actually were in the country.

 Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, still trying to steer his party to a candidate who could unseat Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, suggested Wednesday that if Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> were to quit the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential race, he should run for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> senator. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has `` absolutely no intention of quitting the presidential race.'' `` We are on the move and I think it's kind of absurd for Sen. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> to make that suggestion, although we appreciate his support,'' Ms. Brunette added. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s suggestion _ first made late Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> WCBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ came after <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> scored a respectable third place in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> priamry, behind Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and ex-television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> trailed. `` I would n't be presumptuous to urge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> to drop out of his presidential race,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. `` I think he owes it to his party, to himself, to those who support him, to compete for the presidency as long as he feels he has a chance to win. `` But if he chooses to withdraw, now or even after Super Tuesday, he can make an outstanding candidate and I think a winning candidate for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Senate.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said he had not discussed the idea with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, and that it had only just occurred to him. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s suggestion, replied: `` You've got our poll results.'' He was referring to a survey by <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s campaign taken the first week of February, showing that if <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> were to challenge <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, the incumbent would be favored by 60 percent of the voters statewide while <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would be the choice of 24 percent.

<HEAD>House OKs Malpractice Suits by Active-Duty Military Personnel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to allow medical malpractice lawsuits against the federal government on behalf of active-duty military personnel who suffer injury or death because of negligent care at military hospitals. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes the bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., on the ground that it would restrict a longstanding <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> doctrine that the government is not liable for service-related injuries to members of the armed forces The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill on a 312-61 roll call after voice votes approving a $ 300,000 ceiling on the government's liability and rejecting a proposal to make the bill's provisions retroactive to Jan. 1, 1986. The bill now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. A virtually identical bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by a 317-90 vote in 1985 but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> never acted on it. The House-passed bill Wednesday would cover permanent military hospitals but would exclude treatment at field hospitals or hospital ships and claims stemming from combat activities or foreign jurisdictions. The measure also would prohibit claims for mental or emotional disabilities unless they resulted from a physical injury. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on administrative law and governmental relations, which had heard numerous witnesses testify about medical malpractice involving active-duty military personnel at military hospitals. Active-duty servicemen represent about one-third of those treated at military hospitals and are the only patients who can not sue for medical malpractice. The federal government generally is immune from being sued unless it gives its consent. Under a 1946 federal law, however, the government can be sued for acts of negligence by its employees while on official duty, but the same law protects the government from legal claims stemming from wartime military combat operations. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1950 that the law bars active-duty military personnel from suing the federal government for damages arising from government action or inaction in other situations. This ruling does not prohibit military dependents or retirees from suing the government for medical malpractice.

 A woman accused of killing a mental health caseworker and taking three people hostage at a hospital's psychiatric emergency room complained about mistreatment by doctors, police said At an arraignment Wednesday where she was charged with homicide and reckless endangerment, <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 31, asked why she was being charged rather than her doctors. Officers <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who talked with the woman during the siege, said she claimed doctors gave her too much medicine. `` She kept saying things like, ` <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is not dead,' and that she felt she had not been treated right by doctors at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a former high school classmate of Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` It appears as though she has a mental history,'' said police Chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON>. Meanwhile, the staff of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> planned a memorial service for Monday for caseworker <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, 27, who was shot in the back Tuesday night as she tried to flee. Miss <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> had worked at the hospital since May 1986. `` This is a nightmare. It's the kind of thing psychiatric emergency room -LRB- workers -RRB- always worry about,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. According to Ms. <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> entered the emergency room at 8:55 p.m. and asked a security guard where she could get psychiatric help. The woman told the guard, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterzinger </PERSON>, she wanted to think before registering as a patient and she sat in the waiting area. Miss <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> sat beside her and spoke briefly with her until Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> produced a gun, Ms. <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON> said. `` The victim turned and ran and started yelling for security guards, and at that point the suspect began shooting,'' said police Commander <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> died where she fell, doctors determined. Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> then moved to a bathroom doorway and trained her gun on three people, whom police declined to identify, officials said. `` I asked her to release one of the hostages, but she said she was going to kill them,'' <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> said. The woman wanted to speak to WPTT-TV talk show host <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who went to the hospital but never spoke with her. <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> said he persuaded Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to release a 26-year-old woman among her hostages, and <PERSON> White </PERSON>, keeping his identity as a police officer secret, sat with the two remaining captives. `` I was really scared,'' he said. `` But the other two hostages were very well composed for such a stressful situation. They kept looking at the television.'' Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> asked for cigarettes, and <PERSON> White </PERSON> slid a pack of across the floor toward her. `` When she looked down on the floor at them I rushed her,'' he said. White slammed the door of the bathroom, blocking Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s view of the hostages, and <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> and other officers blockaded the door and placed a bullet-proof shield over it The woman then surrendered and was led screaming in a straitjacket to a police car.

 A judge Wednesday disputed a published report accusing him of approving a huge attorney's fee for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal figure <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> after asking <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to lobby for his federal judgeship. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday said then-Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> orally granted <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and his partner a $ 1 million fee in September 1981, while the White House was considering <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> for the federal bench. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was appointed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in January 1982. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in 1981 was the personal attorney of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who at the time was a White House counselor. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said he has `` never been improperly influenced in any decision'' during his 16 years on the bench, and he added: `` I know of nothing that was improper or unusual about the process of my appointment to the federal bench.'' The fee was awarded to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s firm for representing two young sisters in a personal injury case. It was reduced to $ 322,000 in 1982 by another judge on the grounds that it was excessive. `` The article is misleading in at least one vital respect and should be corrected,'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Contrary to the story's implication,'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said, `` it is a matter of public record ... that I did not finally approve the attorneys' fees that were the focus of the story.'' He said a different judge ultimately set the amount. A spokesman for the judge refused to say whether the judge had initially approved the $ 1 million to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s firm, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, according to the Chronicle, acknowledged seeking help from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> for the federal court appointment and said that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was a friend of long standing. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> strongly denied any connection between his endorsement of <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> for the judgeship and the payment of attorney's fees, the Chronicle said. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was indicted last month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on charges of influence peddling for allegedly taking payments from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to lobby <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> before he became attorney general in order to get the company government contracts.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday for the unveiling of a $ 1.1 trillion budget package and the swearing-in of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as a justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not have any comment on the outcome of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> presidential primaries. The president, on his final day at his mountaintop ranch, watched the results on television Tuesday night. Ending a four-night stay at his 688-acre spread in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> mountains, the president, accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, returned to the White House. High winds forced the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to travel to Point Mugu Naval Air Station by motorcade rather than helicopter for their flight aboard Air Force One. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked upon his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> whether he had any news of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> kidnap victim Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, responded: `` We're still trying to get more information on that.'' As he strode towards the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the president spotted a young boy in a wheelchair among the guests invited to greet him. The boy, identified by a White House aide as 6-year-old <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutting </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, held up a postcard picture of the president. The president walked over to the boy, and amid much laughter and smiles, signed the boy's postcard with his own pen. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had remained in seclusion since he arrived at the ranch Saturday evening following a summit with Mexican President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will meet with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to present them with a copy of his new budget plan, covering the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` it is a remarkable budget that ... includes more money for AIDS research, more money for housing and education, but makes cuts in other areas that will allow us to meet the budget reduction and keep the deficit on a downward path.'' The budget is expected to seek $ 1 billion-plus for AIDS research, modernization of the air traffic control system, more money for orbiting a manned space station and a speed-up of the `` Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program. It also is expected to include a host of measures already rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, such as selling off <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, abolishing the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and selling regional power authorities. Under an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, defense spending will increase by only 2 percent, to $ 299.5 billion. The agreement calls for cutting the federal budget deficit to $ 136 billion, down from $ 148 billion of fiscal year 1987. The swearing-in ceremony for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> will be held in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a member of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, was picked for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and his second nominee, Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, withdrew after acknowledging he had smoked marijuana in earlier days On Friday, the president will meet with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> before leaving for Camp David to spend the weekend.

 Republican presidential aspirant <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> insisted again Wednesday that he believes there are Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but added he has no first-hand knowledge of their existence. `` In my opinion they are there,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told questioners at a news conference here, as he arrived on a campaign swing through <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But he later allowed he was `` not trying to start another Cuban missile crisis.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> initially brought up the topic during a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> debate when he disagreed with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over new U.S.-Soviet intermediate-range nuclear forces pact. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the treaty should be extended to include <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which he contended still had Soviet missiles. The White House issued a quick denial, and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rivals criticized his statement as inflammatory and untrue Later, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> aides said the candidate did mean to say missiles with nuclear warheads. Wednesday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was asked if he considered his statements irresponsible, and responded heatedly. `` It's not irresponsible one bit,'' he said, raising his voice. `` It's a lousy treaty.'' He said he had cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, a prominent member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ssenate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and other committee sources in saying that there had been violations by the Soviets of an agreement made in 1961 to keep missiles out of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Since he first made his comments on missiles, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he had received more reports about nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He did not identify the sources of the reports. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who received 10 percent of the vote in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primary </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected to do `` very well'' in Southern states voting in the March 8 Super Tuesday primary.

The shuttle exploded 73 seconds after blastoff when a joint in its right-side booster leaked flame and ignited the shuttle's giant fuel tank. The settlement leaves one claim pending against Morton-Thiokol, from the family of Challenger co-pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> spokesmen did not return a telephone call for comment Wednesday. `` It was commensurate with what some of the others got _ from $ 2 -LRB- million -RRB- to $ 3.5 million,'' <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> said of the settlement. `` It's all settled, thank God,'' he added `` It was n't what we wanted. It was OK.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s parents filed a $ 1.5 billion suit against the government, <PERSON> Morton-Thiokol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulloy </PERSON>, director of the space agency's solid rocket booster program at the time of the accident A portion of the settlement will go to the Resniks' two grandchildren, and most of the rest will be placed in educational and scholarship funds established in <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>'s memory in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> said.

 Two men sentenced to a total of 735 years in prison for the kidnapping and sexual molestation of two children asked Wednesday that their convictions be overturned. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbarga </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> `` Tree Frog'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 38, were convicted of a string of crimes that began when they snatched 2-year-old <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> from a shopping center in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, in February 1982. It ended 10 months later when police broke into a dingy bread van parked under a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> freeway overpass and discovered <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> huddled inside. The other child in the case, 11-year-old <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, had fled and alerted police. During trial, <PERSON> Carbarga </PERSON>, who was 18 when arrested, was depicted by his attorney as <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s youthful pawn and sex slave since <PERSON> Carbarga </PERSON>'s parents turned their 9-year-old son over to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carbarga </PERSON> pleaded innocent because of insanity. His attorney, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, argued before the three-member panel of the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dossee </PERSON> allowed testimony about <PERSON> Carbarga </PERSON>'s `` tragic mental condition'' in the penalty phase of the trial, but incorrectly prohibited it during the guilt phase. `` It was really the only defense and the jury did n't know it,'' he said. <PERSON> Carbarga </PERSON> was convicted on 93 of the 154 counts against him. Of the convictions, 89 were felonies. Jurors found he was not legally sane at the time of 58 crimes, and he was sentenced to 208 years on 35 offenses. A central issue is prosecution classification of some crimes as taking place before a change in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law that altered standards to determine questions such as whether a defendant knew the difference in right and wrong, could form the required mental intent to commit certain crimes or could appreciate their nature. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said there was a `` two-year window'' between enactment of one law regarding sanity determination and a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that the law had incorrectly stated legislative intent. `` There's no way in hell this boy could have formed the intent required to commit these crimes,'' he said of <LOCATION> Carbarga </LOCATION>. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said `` certain technical problems had to be worked out at trial and have to be worked out on appeal.'' According to <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, the appeals court could take a variety of actions. <PERSON> Carbarga </PERSON> could be tried again on the criminal offenses or the sanity question; he could go to a mental hospital; or be returned to <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Schraer </PERSON>, argued for reversal of his client's convictions saying blacks were unfairly excluded during jury selection. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is black. <PERSON> Schraer </PERSON> also said police acted without a search warrant when they broke into the van. In addition, he said, the defense was not alowed to show potential jurors some of the videotapes and photographs seized and depicting <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> and Mac nude, often in sexual situations. By only describing the material, he argued, the defense could n't reliably gauge response when potential jurors said they could consider the case fairly despite the evidence <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, convicted of 95 felonies and five misdemeanors, is serving a 527-year term.

 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most wanted man was escorted out of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> under heavy security Wednesday and brought to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where he is to face trial in the 1982 collapse of the nation's biggest private bank <PERSON> Licio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON>, 69, was moved into a specially modified three-room jail suite in a former monastery outside <ORGANIZATION> Parma </ORGANIZATION>, state-run RAI reported. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> was the reputed leader of the secret P-2 Masonic lodge, which Italian officials have linked to tax evasion, bribery and conspiracy to topple the government. But under the terms of the extradition agreement with <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> can be tried only in connection with the 1982 collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION>. He fled <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in 1981 after police raided his offices and found a list of alleged lodge members that included <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, business executives, generals and journalists. The scandal toppled the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> government of Premier <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> also has been charged in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in connection with the 1980 bombing of the train station in <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION>, which killed 85 people and wounded 200. In December, a court in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> convicted <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> in absentia of financing right-wing terrorism and sentenced him to eight years in prison. He does not have to serve the sentence because of the extradition arrangement. News reports said Italian authorities planned to begin questioning <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> on Friday about the bank collapse. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> surrendered to Swiss officials on Sept. 21, 1987, after being a fugitive for more than four years. He escaped from Champ-Dollon prison on Aug. 10, 1983, after serving only three days of a two-month sentence for entering <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on false papers.

 A former drug smuggler testified Wednesday in the trial of reputed Colombian cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> that he had turned down a chance to make more money by going to work for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 37, an alleged leader of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, is on trial on charges that he and others smuggled 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> from 1978-80. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 42, former brother-in-law of key prosecution witness <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, testified he had joined <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and others in a marijuana-smuggling venture from 1975 until 1978. But in the summer of 1978, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> announced he was going to work for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> smuggling cocaine and invited partners in his marijuana operation to join him. `` He did n't think we were making enough money,'' said <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. `` I thought he was acting very foolishly.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s group was flown to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay to discuss the switch, and <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> provided a bottle full of cocaine to the guests, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> testified. He said he declined to participate because of the violence of the cocaine business, the legal penalties for being caught and concerns about the drug itself. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> reportedly told <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> purchased protection in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> by paying $ 200,000 a month, the witness said. `` The money was going to Mr. -LRB- <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. -RRB- <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> through an attorney by the name of <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON>,'' he testified. In later arguments, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowe </PERSON> has been identified as the principal mediator between narcotics traffickers and <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> officials.'' Earlier, an attorney for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> attacked the credibility of another admitted marijuana smuggler who said he paid bribes to the prime minister of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Prosecution witness <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> `` Bill'' <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> had testified Tuesday that he had paid some $ 3 million to $ 5 million over two years to <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. Under cross-examination Wednesday, defense attorney <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> about `` all the things you made up in the courtroom about <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay and Mr. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> also questioned <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> extensively about his testimony concerning <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and two of his men shooting up a Norman's Cay home after an altercation at the airport. <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> had testified that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and his men had sprayed the home with automatic weapons fire. But under questioning, <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> said he could n't see if any of the shots hit the house. `` All I can tell you is I stood in the driveway and saw them shoot at the house,'' he said. He also said he did n't see any evidence of gunfire when he later visited the house. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged in this case with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. Co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, is charged with conspiracy.

<TEXT>
 Negotiators for Nicaraguan rebels say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal of more aid has not changed their position for the second round of peace talks Thursday with the Sandinista government. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON>, one of the seven Contra delegates, told reporters after arriving Wednesday that the rebels still want three-way talks including the internal Nicaraguan opposition and they still want to discuss political matters. The leftist Nicaraguan government insists on sticking to the mechanics of arranging a 30-day cease-fire that could lead to a permanent truce. It says political changes will be discussed only after the Contras have accepted an amnesty, laid down their arms and resumed civilian life within the country. <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON>, the rebel delegate, said: `` Our position has not changed, and it will not change. There can be no cease-fire unless the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> first agree to democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The first direct talks were held in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, last month, a week before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> voted down President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for another $ 36.2 million in Contra aid. The rebels and the Nicaraguan government each presented radically different proposals in a two-day session that all said was noted for cordiality and lack of progress. Several diplomatic observers suggested neither side wanted to rock the boat before the congressional vote. Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, Roman Catholic primate of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, will mediate the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> talks. He was visiting <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> business during the San Jose session and sent a substitute. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo is scheduled to arrive at mid-morning and the talks probably will begin in the afternoon at the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> archbishopric. They are scheduled to end Saturday. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister, will lead the Nicaraguan delegation. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Carazo </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> banker, heads the Contra group. The talks are being held in line with a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan signed last August by by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.

 There are no medals when you come in sixth, observed sixth-place <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> finisher <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> on Wednesday. Nor are there headlines or chunks of money coming in, and by day's end it looked as if he and Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> were ready to call it quits. `` We have drafted a statement,'' said <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. `` It still has three conclusions to it and I have to check one of the boxes,'' he said. But the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor conceded `` somebody would have to make a persuasive pitch'' to keep him in the race. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who had not been heard from much after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, scheduled one in the afternoon. `` If you write a story that indicates we're going to bow out, you'll be OK,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> campaign source. Only the presidential candidates named <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> did n't have to face questions about their steadfastness in the wake of the first primary. A strong third in this contest was n't good enough, according to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` It makes a huge difference,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show `` First of all in media momentum _ the headlines in the morning newspaper have his name, rather than mine. It makes a great deal of difference in money.'' The `` he'' was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> who bested <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 20 percent to 18 percent in the Democratic contest. The winner, of course, was <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose finish in his neighboring state came as no surprise. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he has to win either the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucus or the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary next Tuesday to stay in. `` I can not continue to run second and third in various primaries,'' he said. `` You have to win somewhere. And there's no sense in fooling myself or fooling those who follow me.'' So <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> gave himself another week. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he was of `` divided mind'' on what to do. `` I will indulge myself the luxury of agonizing no more than 24 hours,'' he said, leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` My mood this morning is plaid. There are no medals for sixth.'' He planned to spend the day on the telephone. `` What I'm going to ask my frinds is, you know, ` Can I or should I throw it in and acknowledge reality?''' One man's reality, however, was another man's vindication. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who did n't campaign as intensely as the other Democrats in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, looked forward to the Super Tuesday primaries next month when 1,307 Democratic delegates will be picked in 20 states. `` We made a decision not to spend $ 1 million on two or three delegates,'' he said. `` We're saving that for the 1,400 delegates here in the Super Tuesday states.'' He called the results in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and last week in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, inconclusive. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who came in fourth in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> with 8 percent of the vote, said the two contests so far `` proved we could broaden our base.'' Among white families, he was asked by <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning. `` White families,'' replied <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We've found where that point of challenge is. It is that at the plant gate which closed on workers without notice, as in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where there's a closure with too little notice, or where farmers are losing their farms. When they do that, the lights are cut off and people look amazingly similar in the dark.'' And <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, last among seven Democrats with 4 percent, took comfort in doing `` 500 percent better than <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'' where he barely got 1 percent. `` We have just begun, we are committed,'' he said. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> saw his third-place finish as a victory in a `` race for conservatives'' among himself, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>. The other race was one `` for the traditional, moderate wing of the party'' between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> who came in second. `` Finally we've dragged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> out of discussing their resumes and their tax returns and where they're born and into discussing issues,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> returned home to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, late last night and was n't saying much publicly about his 10 percent of the vote and what it meant to his future as a presidential candidate. His office said he was meeting with advisers, presumably discussing that question. `` We're solvent right now and we have enough money to run the campaign for another two weeks,'' said du Pont press secretary <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. For his part, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also was looking to Super Tuesday to overcome a 9 percent showing, dead last, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` They're going to be playing in my backyard,'' he said. And, addressing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the Virginia-born <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said: `` I'm going to beat you there convincingly.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday that courts have the power to order sterilization of the mentally retarded but declined to spell out guidelines for deciding when it is appropriate. A dissenting justice said the court was walking into a legal morass. In a narrowly drawn opinion, seven justices agreed that courts can act on a request that retarded people be sterilized even though a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977. `` We conclude that our district courts possess subject matter jurisdiction over, and accordingly may hear and determine, applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentally incapacitated ward, such as that involved here,'' the high court said in an opinion written by Justice <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>. In his dissent, Justice <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the court was wandering into a subject `` shot through with searching social and ethical questions.'' `` In taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself to the eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendant social and ethical issues,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> wrote. `` Future litigants, faced with unanswered questions of great social and ethical dimensions, or with missing ingredients of a vague application process, will continue to press us for determinations we are singularly unfit to reach.'' The majority rejected that reasoning. `` We do not believe our courts lack jurisdiction over a case merely because the case is important or unavoidably includes a constitutional dimension,'' the court said. `` As always, we must remain mindful that a court can not escape the demands of judging or of making ... difficult appraisals.'' The decision came in a <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> case involving <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tekla </PERSON> <PERSON> Matejski </PERSON>, who are legal guardians of their 33-year-old mentally retarded daughter, court records said. The couple filed an application with a lower court seeking authorization to have their daughter sterilized, but a lawyer appointed by the court to represent the daughter's interests argued that there was no provision in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> law for sterilization. <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pille </PERSON> agreed and dismissed the application. Both sides appealed. Lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> repealed a law providing for sterilization of people `` who are mentally ill or retarded, syphilitic, habitual criminals, moral degenerates, or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society.'' While agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests, the high court refused to set guidelines about when it would be appropriate. `` We are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given the posture of the present case,'' the court said. `` The excursion suggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisory opinion.'' The high court did not indicate why the parents wanted their daughter sterilized. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> wrote that the court's decision would return to haunt it. `` At what level of mental retardation can sterilization be compelled?'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> asked. `` What board or body, if any, will suggest statewide standards? `` The good news is that the majority, in its obvious and wise recognition of its inability to do so, chooses not to address these questions,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> wrote. `` The bad news is that the majority consigns them to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s individual trial judges for ad hoc determinations. `` <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s trial courts must now face these and, undoubtedly, a host of other public policy decisions.'' The leading <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case on the issue was Buck vs. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in 1927, in which the court upheld a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law that provided for the sterilization of institutionalized retarded persons. The decision set guidelines including the appointment of a guardian, a hearing and the right of appeal. More than 7,500 persons were sterilized before <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> abandoned the program in 1972, according to state records cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. In 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> enacted new guidelines for judges deciding sterilization cases. In other cases in recent years: _ In 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down a law enacted in 1980 that banned sterilization of retarded persons The following year, a <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge authorized sterilization of a 31-year-old woman who had Down's Syndrome The operation was sought by her parents. _ In 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> killed a $ 3 million lawsuit filed by a woman who had been sterilized at age 14 The woman had sought damages from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eugenics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which approved the surgery in 1974 on the grounds that the woman was mentally retarded. A federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> had ordered a trial of the suit, but a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a jury rejected her claim. _ In 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that incompetent individuals could be sterilized only if a court determined that the operation appeared to be in the best interest of the patient and if procedural safeguards had been followed The ruling came in a case involving a 19-year-old woman wit

 The uncle of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday said he expects his nephew will act like an officer and a gentleman. `` He loves his country. He is capable of standing up as well as an ordinary man will under the circumstances. ... I do n't think they could bring enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his country in any way. I think he would die first,'' said <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON>, uncle of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, was extremely ill in a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> hospital Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had come home this fall on emergency leave to visit his father. `` It's been very trying times because we've been here at the hospital off and on for two weeks. Then we hear this. If one thing's bad, two is worse,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, is the Marine officer's sister. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> told WHAS-TV that she called her brother's wife, Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Wednesday morning to tell her to get him home from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as soon as possible so he could see his father before he died. That is when she learned of the abduction. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said the elder <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is too ill to understand what happened to his son. `` The man has not opened his eyes in a couple of days. There's no way he could be able to comprehend, although he may be able to hear,'' he said The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, was on temporary detail serving as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was kidnapped in the late afternoon on the coastal highway between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s southernmost port of Tyre and the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, site of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force's headquarters. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' family lived in <LOCATION> Garrard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> when he was born and later moved to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, where he was graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1963. Much of his leisure time was spent with his uncle. `` He fished a lot with me. He drove me from time to time. He drove me to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> once, to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, down south a couple of times. We were pretty close together as he grew up,'' said <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON>, 86, a former circuit court judge. `` Yes, he wanted to be in the military service. He always talked about wanting to go to the military service. He wanted to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>,'' Eagle said. He was appointed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, but elected instead to study at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ROTC scholarship. He was commissioned a 2nd lietenant when he graducated in 1967, with a business degree. He later earned masters' degrees in human resources management at <ORGANIZATION> Pepperdine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and in political science at <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1968 and 1972, and later was a rifle company commander in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an instructor at the staff non-commissioned officers academy at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and a rifle company commander at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>. In 1980, he was a distinguished graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> served in various staff positions at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, and graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. A high school friend said students at Southern were surprised when <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> went into the Marines. `` You think of the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> as being macho-type, and he really was n't like that. But he seems to have done all right at it,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, now a lab technician at <ORGANIZATION> Rohm </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. `` He was involved in a lot of social activities, played football and was one of the top students in the class,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` Just pretty much an average guy.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, an assistant principal at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was a math teacher there when <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> attended and was also a neighbor. `` He was a top student and very active in school. He played on the football team. He came from a good family and was well liked,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. Eagle said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was more studious than athletic but was a boy who `` liked to hunt and fish and romp in the woods.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is married to Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who works at the Pentagon. He has a 17-year-old daughter by a previous marriage.

 American Ballet Theater star <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON> died from an overdose of cocaine, codeine, methadone and other drugs, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday. <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>, 30, was found dead Dec. 29 in his apartment in <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> DePascale </PERSON> said investigators found `` significant quantities of dangerous substances'' in <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>'s body. Among the substances were ethanol, painkillers and salicylate, a component of aspirin, the autopsy said. <PERSON> DePascale </PERSON> said he has ruled out suicide because no note was found. He said the case was being closed because it was unlikely investigators could trace the source of the drugs. The prosecutor said in December that authorities suspected a drug overdose, but that an autospy and toxicology tests would be needed to determine an official cause of <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>'s family said he was having trouble handling the pressures of the highly competitive dance world in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>, a principal performer for the theater company, had gone to the <ORGANIZATION> Betty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last summer and left the substance abuse program `` dried out'' in August, said his twin brother, <PERSON> William </PERSON>.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sought support Wednesday for his proposals to revive the moribund <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace process, meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who leaves for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> late this week, will travel to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at the end of the month to try to push <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders toward the negotiating table. `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> appears encouraged by the support he's gotten so far for his proposals,'' <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> told reporters following a 30-minute meeting with the secretary. But he added that `` the positions of the various sides are still far apart and one should not expect the ice to melt right away.'' <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> said he supports <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s initiative `` and the high degree of his activism. I do n't think this is just a symbolic effort and that the Americans will withdraw afterward. This is a serious initiative.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is laying the groundwork for the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to continue mediation efforts between Arabs and Israelis, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headed by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who favors the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan. His rival in the coalition government, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, has expressed some reservations. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> said he hopes <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> can overcome <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hesitancy. At the Capitol, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not outline any `` magic solution'' or precise plan for dealing with the problems of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> other than to say he would devote himself to the search for a breakthrough <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did provide assurances that, contrary to some reports, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> is not opting out of the peace process. The senator said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, responding to a question, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not to use `` undue violence'' in dealing with rebellious Palestinians but also has expressed understanding that `` some strength is needed'' to deal with the situation. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he believes that it is `` high time'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visited the area in an attempt to revitalize the peace `` What we see going on there is a tragic situation and what we see on our newscasts every evening certainly does n't go over very well with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met Tuesday night with some 25 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to present his proposals and arranged to lay out his plans for senators Wednesday night. The plan he will propose in his <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> talks has not been made public, but it reportedly calls for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations to start in April on an interim autonomy agreement for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It envisions that talks on the permanent fate of the territories would begin in December. Several Arab leaders have rejected the interim solution included in the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> proposal, while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes the notion of negotiating for a permanent solution. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> fears that such talks would force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give back the lands it captured from the Arabs in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s re-engagement in the peace process was sparked by two months of rioting in the occupied territories in which at least 53 Palestinians have been killed.

 A union official whose cooperation was considered crucial to saving the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> boycotted labor-management negotiations Wednesday, with a deadline for closing the paper two days away. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, president of the 350-member drivers' union, did not join the negotiations. Both sides had said agreement was impossible without the cooperation of his union. Late in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> announced that arbitrator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, a labor law professor at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, had denied a petition by the drivers' union to stop the paper from closing Feb. 19. The union argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> was required by contract to give 30 days' notice of any change in work rules, <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> decided that the rule did not apply if the paper was closing. `` The newspaper hopes that the drivers will now work with them in reaching an agreement,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. Earlier, labor lawyer <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON>, who is advising the newspaper's union, had said `` there's no chance of a settlement before Friday.'' The talks between management and nine <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> unions at the Grand Hyatt Hotel were scheduled to continue around the clock until the 2 p.m. Friday deadline set by <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, who has demanded $ 24 million in union concessions over three years. After meeting for 35 minutes, both sides broke for lunch and consultations. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said they had discussed the concession figure and told reporters, `` I feel optimistic. We all had smiles in there, I think.'' If the unions refuse to go along with the concessions, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> has said his $ 37 million sale of the paper to real estate developer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> will collapse and the paper will close. Participants in the talks included <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> executives, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> and leaders from most of the eight unions which constitute the trades council. <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> had no comment after the brief meeting. One union leader, <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> of the pressmen's union, said one goal was to extend the deadline. `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> -RRB- stays with the Friday deadline, I do n't know what'll happen,'' he said. Under the terms of his contract with <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> has until Monday to negotiate the union concessions. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> opted to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation preventing cross-ownership of a newspaper and a television station in the same city. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> also owns WNYW-TV in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He faces a similar cross-ownership situation in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> claims he has lost nearly $ 150 million since purchasing the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> 11 years ago.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> headed full-speed from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> into a Southern campaign Wednesday, spending the day after his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> triumph talking tough on military issues in a region where he hopes to take his next big step toward the Democratic nomination. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who won a lopsided victory over six <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on Tuesday, left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> at dawn and was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and campaigning while his triumph was still fresh. In the next three weeks, he will be spending much time _ and money _ in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where 14 states will have their primaries on March 8, known as Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, more liberal than many Southern Democrats, put a heavy emphasis on the military after a speech in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, declaring he would use force to stop a foreign aggressor in this hemisphere or to counterattack terrorists. `` I'm a very tough guy when it comes to terrorism,'' he said. `` I do n't yield on toughness to <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in any shape or manner,'' he added in a reference to the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who has staked his campaign on doing well in the South. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his emphasis on defense issues had nothing to do with any Southern strategy but came simply `` because I was asked about it.'' He also said some issues are more important to some regions than others, adding, `` The South, for many years, has been the location for many military installations.'' His speech to about 500 spectators was essentially the same as his victory speech in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> Tuesday night. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used the words `` strong'' or `` strength'' 14 times in a 15-minute address. Former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Layne </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dutch </PERSON> <PERSON> Morial </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> appearance. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said that she and her fellow governors used to say of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` Now there's something worth watching.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the idea that the South is politically different from the rest of the nation is a false image created by the press. `` There's a mythology about the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> as if it's some kind of foreign country. It's nonsense,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. In his victory speech the previous night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I have no Southern strategy.'' But his aides say his campaign will focus on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ the four Southern states with the most delegates to the Democratic National Convention. `` The bottom line is delegates; that's what we're looking for Super Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' national political coordinator. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also is expected to do well in his home state, in neighboring <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, all of which also have contests on March 8. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is running his father's Southern campaign, said, `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> are places where we started early. Those are the four largest states but we're everywhere and moving quickly. In <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told about 600 cheering supporters: `` I do n't have to tell you how important <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is going be.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has led in recent polls in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which ranks second among Super Tuesday states with 135 Democratic delegates. He also fired a shot across <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s bow when told the <LOCATION> Tennesssee </LOCATION> senator had accused his opponents of being alienated from the electorate. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, virtually left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know who's alienated.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made it clear Wednesday that he would continue to contrast his positions with those of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who finished second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> after beating him in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. On foreign trade, one of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s main issues, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` A portion of the problem has to do with unfair trade practices.'' But he also said the federal budget deficit is the primary culprit and he said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> helped create the problem by voting for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1981 tax cut. In one strategic uncertainty, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides say that between now and Super Tuesday the Democratic field could narrow, forcing a more direct comparison of the remaining candidates. During the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, negative campaigning by his oppoents `` failed miserably. When you have many candidates in a race, trying to strike out at a number of them does n't work.'' The 20 caucuses and primaries on Super Tuesday _ including 14 in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> _ wo n't come to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as easily as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, his aides recognize. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, next door to his home state, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had hundreds of volunteers. In the South, a paid staff of 64 in 15 offices is seeking to create a new volunteer corps. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with its Northeastern transplants and Jewish population, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with its Hispanic vote and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with its concentration of high technology industries will be places where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigns hard, said aide <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> is Jewish. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> game plan combines an emphasis on economic growth and opportunity with strengthening of the nation's conventional military force. Politically, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is hoping that the credibility he gains from winning <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and from hoped-for good showings in the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucus and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary on Feb. 22 will make up for any disadvantage created by his ethnic and geographic origin. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his father's Greek background and immigrant parents `` may be an initial hurdle at times'' in the South. But he said, `` People pronounce his name just fine. People are looking way beyond that.'' Boston-based political consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign sources tell him the governor will spend between $ 3 million and $ 4 million in the South to spread his message across such a large region. And <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the ads would begin with a biographical series, to introduce the candidate to voters.

 A former Methodist minister accused in a civil lawsuit of trying to kill his wife was served with court papers as he and a female companion tried to flee in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Tuesday. A process server slipped a copy of the lawsuit under the windshield wipers of a car as <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> psychologist, sped away from a northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> resort Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said. The parents of <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, filed the lawsuit Feb. 2, accusing their son-in-law of the attempted strangulation. The suit seeks unspecified damages. Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has been in a coma since she was left for dead on the floor of the family's garage April 22. She is in a Tyler nursing home. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> denies attacking his wife. He has said he was studying at two libraries and came home to find his wife on the floor. Several lawyers told the newspaper that they believe placing the papers under the windshield wipers would be considered a proper service. They said they did n't know of any case with the same circumstances, but that visibility was the key in serving a lawsuit. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, former minister of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, and Ms. <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>, who reportedly told a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury that she and <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> traveled together and once discussed marriage, were spotted at 2 p.m. Sunday at a <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, inn by process server <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reporter. The couple were drinking beer outside their $ 140-a-night cabin when they spotted the process server and reporter. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON> ran inside and remained there for 22 hours, the newspaper said. They did not turn on any lights and had food delivered by room service and instructed inn employees to put through telephone calls only from certain individuals. On Monday, a resort employee carried their luggage to their rented car. Ms. <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON> walked out of the cabin, got into the car and <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> darted from the cabin with a coat over his head. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> slumped down in the front seat as the car sped out of the driveway. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> ran alongside the car, identified himself as a process server and placed the papers under the windshield wipers, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in an interview late last week that he was not attempting to avoid the legal papers and was `` keeping a low profile'' to avoid the press. But <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON> declined to answer the door at the cabin when <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> knocked and identified himself as a process server. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has until the first Monday after the expiration of 20 days since being served to answer the charges in the suit, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s parents.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday granted Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> a one-week delay of his impeachment trial set to begin Monday. The action came on a voice vote. Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated two motions for delay offered by the embattled governor's attorney, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s chief justice, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who will preside at the impeachment trial, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a one-week delay would ultimately save time by allowing some issues to be settled beforehand. However, Sen. Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> said, `` There is an ongoing fear ... that this will be the beginning of lots of motions for continuation'' by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had asked that the trial be put off until criminal charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan are adjudicated. He contended that an impeachment trial would prejudice the criminal trial jury. But a motion to delay the trial until 20 days after the criminal case is resolved lost on a voice vote, and a motion to delay the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proceeding a flat 90 days went down 24-5, with five Republicans supporting the governor. After the one-week delay passed, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> would not say whether he would go to court in an effort to obtain a further delay. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that if the trial was not delayed, he would go to state or federal court. Before the two earlier votes Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, a Republican, had said, `` I think we need to expedite the trial.'' Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, agreed, saying, `` His -LRB- <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s -RRB- game is delay. That's his middle name.'' At least 72 people are considering challenging <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in a recall election May 17, including a former congressman and a former state school superintendent who lost to the Republican in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeached <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on Feb. 5 and accused him of concealing the $ 350,000 loan, misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official Wednesday was the first day for recall election candidates to file petition signatures aimed at getting placed on the ballot. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> will automatically be put on the ballot, but all other candidates must file 3,336 signatures of registered voters by March 18. By midday Wednesday, nobody had turned in any petition signatures, but 72 had picked up packets to collect signatures. The most prominent names among them are those of Democrat <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in a three-way gubernatorial race in 1986, and former Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, who planned to announce Friday whether he would run. But some of the lesser knowns among the prospective candidates also insist they have a shot at unseating <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Colosimo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, a former teacher and musician, said, `` If I did n't think I could win, I would n't run.'' He has never sought public office before and admitted his campaign thus far was a `` one-man show.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaupell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> mortgage loan officer, acknowledged he has no real chance of winning. Asked why he was running, he said, `` I should n't be. There's probably much more qualified people.'' Republican national committeeman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Londen </PERSON> also said he will run so voters will have a choice of a conservative candidate in case <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is barred from running in the recall. If <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, lawmakers could vote to bar him from holding any future public office. <PERSON> Londen </PERSON> said he would pull out if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> stays on the ballot.

 <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has given the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains believed to be those of Americans missing from the Vietnam War, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Laotian reports said Thursday. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> said the mission's charge d'affaires, <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Isom </PERSON>, and military officials received the remains at a ceremony at <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> airport Wednesday. The Laotians also handed over pieces of aircraft wreckage they excavated in December and January, the statement said. It said the remains were to flown to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for analysis at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Central Identification Laboratory. The turnover also was reported Wednesday by the official Laotian radio. The broadcast, a text of which was obtained Thursday from a Western embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said the remains were retrieved during a December excavation in <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province and a January dig in <LOCATION> Saravane </LOCATION> province. Both are in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' southern panhandle area, between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` At the same time, the Lao side also handed over to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government copies of the I.D. cards of three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers missing in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>,'' the broadcast said. The reports did not specify how many remains were handed over.

There are 555 Americans listed as missing in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> from the Vietnam War years, most of them airmen shot down during bombing runs against Laotian and Vietnamese communist positions. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has been working to improve its relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with an eye toward getting international aid and economic help from the West.

<DATELINE>USULUTAN, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 600 rebels using mortars, grenades and automatic weapons attacked an infantry base and cotton cooperative early Wednesday in the biggest guerrilla operation since early 1987. Officials said at least 18 people were killed and 14 wounded. The battle raged in and around this provincial capital of 70,000 people 70 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital. Military officers said two detachments of about 300 leftist insurgents each took part in the coordinated attacks, which included blowing up two bridges linking the capital and <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s eastern province. Seven members of a civilian family _ a couple and five children aged 7 months to nine years _ were killed when a mortar shell hit their one-room brick and adobe home in a poor neighborhood just outside the 6th Infantry Brigade headquarters. Col. <PERSON> Inocencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, brigade commander, said five soldiers were killed in combat at advance posts outside the base perimeter and no guerrillas penetrated the base. The attack began at 12:10 a.m. and lasted about three hours, he said. <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said four of the 55 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers stationed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were at the base when the assault began, but none was in danger. He said the bodies of three guerrillas were brought to the base and two other bodies were removed by the retreating insurgents. Radio Venceremos, the clandestine rebel transmitter, called the raid a success and claimed the attackers inflicted 190 casualties. It gave no breakdown of dead and wounded. The coordinated attacks appeared to be the largest in scale since the rebels hit the 4th Infantry Brigade in the northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> last March 31. That battle cost 70 lives, including that of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military adviser, and more than 100 people were wounded. One member of the military <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> was killed in the attack on the Salvadoran <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> about 5 miles west of <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Henriquez </PERSON>, commander of the 30-man detachment stationed at the cooperative, said the assault began with mortar and rocket-propelled grenade fire at 12:20 a.m. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who began fighting the U.S.-backed government eight years ago, have waged a campaign of economic sabotage that includes attacks on the coffee, cotton and sugar industries. Those industries account for 80 percent of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s export earnings. Wednesday's attacks came hours before five Central American foreign ministers met at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> hotel to discuss progress in implementing a regional peace plan signed Aug. 7. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON>, host minister, urged his colleagues to ensure that their countries comply with the plan's prohibition of external aid to insurgents. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government accuses neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of backing the Salvadoran rebels. Guerrillas left leaflets on streets around the infantry base calling for popular insurrection and accusing President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of `` selling national sovereignty to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The attack's effect was evident well into the afternoon. Trucks full of soldiers with M-16 assault rifles sped along dusty roads. Helicopters and spotter planes flew overhead. <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said the guerrillas retreated to the north toward <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION> volcano, on whose slopes insurgents camp. Lt. <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> at the cotton cooperative said the attack there began with about 15 minutes of mortar fire. `` Then they attacked shouting like Indians,'' he said on the porch of the cooperative's offices. `` They shouted at us to surrender, calling to me by my name that it was useless to resist.'' He said he and his men held off the attackers from trenches at the front of the cooperative, but guerrilla fighters penetrated from the sides and rear. Seven of the unit's open-sided warehouses were burned. At the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> crossing 9 miles west of <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, peasants milled around a hole 50 feet long and 20 deep where a bridge had been the day before. Residents said the they heard a tremendous explosion at about 12:30 a.m. and rebels then blew down power poles on either side of the road. Local officials reported skirmishes in at least three other provinces _ <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cabanas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>. Rebel radio said the attacks in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> and the northeastern province of <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> were part of a new operation they called `` Death to the Killers of <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanabria </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, coordinator of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was assassinated Oct. 26.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to give to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> the world's largest collection of Nazi documents, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Wednesday. The Berlin Document Center, administered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, holds about 30 million documents from the Nazi era. They can be viewed by scholars, government officials, prosecutors investigating Nazi war crimes and others. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been discussing a West German takeover of the archives for years. The two countries have agreed that the center's archives will be given to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after they are copied on microfilm, according to officials from both sides. Under the plan, the originals will be handed over to the West German federal archives, and the microfilm copies will be taken to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for storage. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about half the center's documents have already been copied onto microfilm. The West German government is paying for the copying of the documents. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> justice officials, meanwhile, said an investigation into the possible theft of tens of thousands of documents from the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Document Center was still under way. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaehne </PERSON>, denied news reports that an arrest in the case was imminent, and said investigators could not yet determine how long their probe would take.

<TEXT>
 Prices shot above official levels Wednesday as the Nicaraguan government implemented a plan to replace its old currency with new notes. Prices for eggs, cooking oil and soft drinks tripled. At least 40 Nicarguans were arrested for currency violations and police said several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy employees were caught illegally exchanging currency. Commander <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tijerino </PERSON>, the city's police chief, said none of the embassy employees were arrested. The program, which went into effect Monday, replaced the old cordoba currency with new cordoba notes pegged at a higher value to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. Nicaraguans had three days to exchange their old cordoba bills for new ones. The government closed the period for trading old bills Wednesday, claiming enough new bills were in circulation. Commander <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON>, deputy interior minister, told the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Barricada that the government had discovered a Contra plan to introduce large quantities of old cordobas into the country. He said border customs houses were closed Monday to stop the alleged plan. The cordoba is worth 1,000 times more than the old currency. The new cordoba is worth about 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cents. The Sandinista government also authorized price increases of up to 500 percent for a list of 33 basic staples, and raised salaries up to five times above their December levels. The government said it sought to curb inflation, which reached 1,500 percent in 1987. But prices for many basic goods suddenly jumped beyond their official levels this week _ even at government sales booths that ration the commodities. A carton of 30 eggs that went for the equivalent of 15 new cordobas last week rose to 50 cordobas at the government booths, and fetched 60 in the black market. Meat prices also shot up. A liter -LRB- about a quart -RRB- of cooking oil that sold for 3.7 cordobas in the government booths last week rose to 12 this week. In the black market, the price per liter went from 100 to 150 cordobas. Thousands of people were angered with the new prices, according to a new radio channel the government set up last weekend to explain the reforms. One resident of the <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libertad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, in the east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, complained that a tiny corn tortilla `` smaller than a hand'' now costs a full cordoba, double what it did before the currency swap. Soft drinks that used to cost 3 cordobas now cost 15, even though the government's fixed price was ten, he complained. Newspapers also raised their prices. The opposition daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, which formerly cost the equivalent of two new cordobas, sold for ten Wednesday. Barricada, the government daily, sold for five cordobas, up from one last week. Nicaraguans were only allowed to cash in 10 million cordobas. Those arrested for currency violations face up to six months in prison. <PERSON> Tijerino </PERSON>, the police chief, said `` various vehicles from the American Embassy were surprised giving personnel -LRB- at an exchange house -RRB- packets that supposedly contained money.'' He said the law mandates all foreign embassy personnel change their old currency at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. It was not clear whether the embassy employees were Americans.

 The obscure cargo airline that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces questions about its safety record as the government decides whether it is fit to carry passengers.

 Housing construction suffered a second consecutive monthly decline in January, dipping to the weakest pace since the end of the last recession, the government reported Wednesday. The 1.9 percent January decline in construction of single-family homes and apartments, reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, raised new concerns among some economists about the possibility of a recession this year. However, other analysts pointed to a second government report showing that industrial production rose for the fourth consecutive month in January.

 <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON>, who'd never been to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> before, started last year with a miniseries in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and ended it with a movie in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. In between, he returned to his native <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to do an independent film with some friends. The miniseries, `` Noble House,'' starts its eight-hour, four-part run on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> this Sunday. It's based on the best-selling book by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavell </PERSON>. The movie in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is `` The Deceivers,'' from the book by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON>. The Irish movie is `` Taffin.'' In `` Noble House,'' Brosnan stars as <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunross </PERSON>, the tai-pan, or boss, of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s leading trading house. It also stars <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Raffin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhys-Davies </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> directed it on location in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for 12 weeks and at the <LOCATION> Dino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurentiis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Studio </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for another 12 weeks. `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> was my first step into the Orient,'' said <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON>. `` It's a fascinating place, sort of a condensed version of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. My schedule was such that I had time to go around and see the place. I bought an automatic camera and did some photography. `` What was around me was so exciting to look at and so different. The colors and the light were magical. Having started life as a commercial artist, I've always looked at things as though to paint them. I used a zoom lens because the Chinese do n't like having their pictures taken.'' As the story opens, <PERSON> Dunross </PERSON> has just taken over the family's trading empire `` He's fairly ruthless in his dealings with people,'' said <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON>. `` He has a remoteness to him. An isolated charm. I've never played a character like him before The job came at a very opportune moment, after the whole incident of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> and ` <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>.''' After <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> canceled `` Remington Steele'' a few seasons back, <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON> was asked to become the next <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had decided to step down as 007. Then, because of the publicity over <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> put `` Remington Steele'' back on the schedule, and <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON> was dropped from the Bond picture. Did he see the offer of the role in `` Noble House'' as a peace offering? `` I never thought of it as a peace offering,'' he answered. `` I saw it as a way of putting as much distance between myself and ` <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>' as possible. I'd always enjoyed doing the series, but I knew coming back for six more episodes was hogwash. They wanted to have their cake and eat it. `` The turmoil for me was the on and off anxiety of the Bond part. It lasted an eternity. I was offered <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. I said yes. ` <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>' was brought back. That's enough to say on the subject. It was a shame because ` <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>' was never allowed to finish with any grace.'' As it turned out, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> was hired to play <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> in `` The Living Daylights.'' <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON> said he sees no chance that he will ever play the role. His wife, <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, was <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s leading lady in the Bond movie `` For Your Eyes Only.'' <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> movie, `` The Deceivers,'' is set in 1824 and focuses on the Thugs who worshipped the god of destruction, <LOCATION> Kali </LOCATION>. `` I play an Englishman, a glorified accountant working for the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` He discovers this cult and disguises himself as an Indian. He goes on the road with the Thugs, who kill people by strangulation.'' <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON>'s only current appearances on TV are in a commercial for Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, which was premiered during the Super Bowl coverage. It was filmed on a speeding train in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and looks like a scene right out of a spy thriller such as a Bond movie, or perhaps `` The Fourth Protocol,'' in which <PERSON> Brosnan </PERSON> played a Soviet agent being tracked down by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>. `` That was me walking on top of that train,'' he said. `` It was going 40 miles an hour. If I'd fallen off that sucker I'd never have done ` The Deceivers.'''

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON>, who has been wowing TV audiences with his portrayal of brilliant, bedeviled bad guy <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Profitt </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Wiseguy,'' had a tough act to follow. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> had created one of the season's best villains in <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelgrave </PERSON>, a tough New Jersey-based crime boss who turned out to be so lovable that undercover hero <PERSON> Vinnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Terranova </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> -RRB- wept when he died. But <PERSON> Steelgrave </PERSON> was gone, and <PERSON> Vinnie </PERSON> had to have a new investigation. Enter <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Profitt </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Severance </PERSON> -RRB-, a bizarre brother-sister act with an international crime syndicate and a vaguely incestuous relationship. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON>, a manic-depressive with a genius IQ, gets his self-destruction wish in Monday's episode. The finite role is what appealed to <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON>. `` I was really attracted to be able to go and do a role for a number of weeks, find out what it was like to do a TV series but not be tied to one, create a character that hopefully will be memorable and get out,'' <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> said recently, back home in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` You know, the crew, they're the biggest critics, they not only were in love with the character -LRB- <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelgrave </PERSON> -RRB-, they knew <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, and they hung out with <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, and they were, like, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s pal, and here was this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> actor coming in.'' By his last day on the set, <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> said, `` one of the crew members came up and said, ` You know, when you came on, we thought no one would ever make us forget, uh ... What's his name?' I thought that was a really great compliment.'' If <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> won over the `` Wiseguy'' crew, he also won over audiences. Back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he said, people were stopping him on the street and quoting lines from the show to him. `` Wiseguy'' premiered last fall on Thursday, opposite <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s high-rated lineup, so it did n't get much attention But with the introduction of the Profitts mid-season, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> moved it to Monday night, where it is doing better. <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON>, a dedicated <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage actor, had little screen time before the series. He starred on Broadway in `` Hurly Burly'' and later with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> in `` Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' a performance that can be seen later this season on PBS. He worked with <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> again in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s recent miniseries `` The Murder of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> played a newspaper reporter. He has a movie due out in April, `` Rocket Gibraltar,'' in which he plays <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>'s son, a standup comic. <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON>, in fact, did standup as an impressionist in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. His specialty is <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, but he also does a mean <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> to shoot `` Wiseguy.'' A number of film projects have moved to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> because of lower production costs. `` I travel with a large black Labrador named Slate,'' <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> said. `` My dog's traveled all over the world, and he's this incredible, like, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> dog. I found him as a stray in'81. And I hate hotel life, it's too busy. So I went on the hunt and found this great apartment, very quiet and secluded down near the largest park in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Stanley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. I thought, great, no actors. Nobody knows about it. `` I get in the elevator the first day I'm living there, and <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> is standing in it.'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> was shooting an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie. <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> notes casually that he and <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> knew each other already. When he was 15, <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> said, he saw <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> production of `` A Matter of Gravity.'' He waited for her in the parking lot with a bouquet of flowers. The gesture won him a few precious minutes with the actress. After a performance of `` Long Day's Journey,'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> came backstage to congratulate the actors. <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> said he was too choked up to mention their meeting of years before. But the next day he sent her another bouquet, with a letter. He got a note back, he said, which, in typical Hepburn style, noted it was the first time she had received flowers for simply attending the theater, not performing. Since then, the two have stayed in touch.

<HEAD>A Wary Look At Bond Mutual Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Since the Wall Street crash last fall, many savers and investors have been taking a closer look at bond mutual funds as an alternative to stock funds. Bond prices and bond fund net asset values have generally been rising since October as interest rates have fallen. In fact, most analysts agree, one reason for that trend has been strong demand for bonds by investors large and small who have been scared away from the stock market. But if bonds and bond funds are the trendy thing right now, do they make sense as a place to put your money if you are n't particularly interested in high current income from your savings Does the prospective reward match up well with the risks involved? The overall return bond funds will produce in the future depends to a significant extent on such imponderables as what happens to interest rates and the economy. If you think the nation is headed for a calamitous, deflationary recession, a fund investing in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds would seem a logical bet. The bonds are backed by a guarantee from the federal government. And should circumstances ever reach the point that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> defaults on its obligations, just about all other domestic investments -LRB- with the possible exception of gold -RRB- will surely be in terrible shape as well. If, on the other hand, you think a financial Armageddon is n't in the cards, the question is more problematical. A study just conducted by <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> investment adviser, may give you some pause before investing in a high-quality bond fund. In his newsletter NoLoad Fund X, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> compared the performance of four different types of funds over the 10-year period that ended Dec. 31. That would seem a good test period, in that it included a couple of recessions, an energy crisis, a near-panic on inflation, a long bull market for stocks and, as a finale, a market crash. Especially pertinent for bonds, it also contained spells of both high and rising interest rates and low and falling interest rates. To represent the stock market, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> chose the <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> 500 Index Trust, a mutual fund set up to track as closely as possible the ups and downs of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index. Each $ 100 invested in that fund at the end of 1977 grew to $ 389 a decade later, for an annual compound growth rate of 14.6 percent. As a gauge of the performance of high-yielding, lower-rated bonds _ widely known as `` junk'' bonds _ he picked the <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> fund, which increased a $ 100 investment over the 10 years to $ 323, for an annual compound growth rate of 12.4 percent. From the ranks of the high-quality bond funds, the <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fixed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portfolio </ORGANIZATION> increased $ 100 to $ 254, which translates to annual compound growth of 9.8 percent. In the same span the Reserve Fund, a money market fund, turned $ 100 into $ 258, producing annual growth of 9.9 percent. A comparison of the last two funds is striking. Holders of the high-quality bond fund were not compensated for the constant risk they faced of fluctuations in the fund's net asset value. The return they received failed even to match what investors got from the money fund, which normally has a constant net asset value. This, said <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, `` raises the question whether bond funds, except for high yield bond funds, merit the additional risk compared to money funds or the stock market.''

<HEAD>Former Musician Finds Happiness Making Peanut Butter</HEAD>

 Meet <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, the gourmet peanut-butter entrepreneur who's nuts about his job. `` I come in here every day and think, ` Thank God! This is marvelous!' It's the most exciting thing I've ever done in my life. Somedays, I'm just bursting,'' he says before climbing a metal ladder and ducking his head into a 700-pound vat of dry-roasted peanuts. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> is a former symphony conductor, piano teacher and nursery school administrator who spent the better part of his adult life yearning for the gooey, old-fashioned taste of the peanut butter he remembered from childhood. Which is why he started grinding peanut butter in his wife's blender 25 years ago And it is why he sells a couple of million dollars worth of his speciality peanut butter in supermarkets, gourmet shops and health-food stores from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` I was making it and giving it to my friends, my students, my dentist, in little 1 -LCB- - ounce jars Listen, 1 -LCB- ounces of peanut butter is a lot of work when you're making it by hand. Anyway, people kept saying, ` You ought to sell this,''' said the 58-year-old president of C.R. <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> during a recent interview. He paused to look at several one-pound jars of Crazy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s Peanut Butter that line his paneled office at the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> plant Then, breaking into a rich belly laugh, he shrugged, `` Who knew?'' Certainly not <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, who studied conducting with <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and toured as the musical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winnipeg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> before coming home to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to teach piano to children. But even as he toured the world as a musician, he kept looking for a peanut butter made from just plain 100 percent peanuts, just like it says today on every one of his brown-and-orange labels. `` The truth is it really does n't require those additives. Peanut butter does not have to be salted, sweetened or stabilized. What the heck's wrong with the oil rising to the top? Just take a table knife and stir it down. Meanwhile what you have is a purer form of food,'' he said. He learned he was n't the only person who liked his specialty line of peanut butter made sans sugar, salt and oil. In 1973, he started making his peanut butter with the help of a plant in <LOCATION> Conshocken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. By 1979, he sold a private school which he had started in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and turned to making peanut butter full time, first at a rented facility in <LOCATION> Pennsauken </LOCATION> and now at the plant he bought last year in this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. In his first year, he sold 18,000 cases. Now, he says he's selling more than twice that amount annually `` We will sell between three-quarters of a million to 1 million jars this year. It's very exciting, especially when you realize this is something I started in the back of my car with 144 jars,'' he said. The kitchen blender has long been retired and replaced by a 1910 grinding machine that churns out about 4,000 gallons of Crazy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s Peanut Butter on a good day when the line is running and all eight of the plant's employees are on hand. `` This machine does n't know how to make modern-day peanut butter. It could n't even if we wanted to,'' said <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, who stopped eating the modern stuff in the 1940s when homogenization was introduced to peanut butter manufacturing. Homogenization breaks down the fat particles and blends the fat throughout the rest of the product. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>' unhomogenized peanut butter has swirls of oil floating on top, which in his words, defines real peanut butter. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> says the homogenizing process `` altered, once and for all, the taste of peanut butter in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Sometimes I'm amazed there was no public outcry.'' he said. `` Everything was homogenized in those days. Nobody knew what it meant, but if it did n't have it, they would n't buy it,'' he said. There are three products in his line: creamy, chunky and chocolate-flavored peanut butter. None is homogenized, all are his favorites. `` I usually have it for breakfast. If you have it for breakfast, you do n't need lunch. It really quells the appetite,'' he said while briskly strolling past pallets piled with burlap bags of peanuts or cardboard cases of the finished product. He attributes much of his success to entering the market just at a time when the back-to-nature movement was emerging in the 1970s. `` Processing changes the consistency and flavor of food. Here, you get it in the natural state,'' he said, adding that luck also seemed to play a major role in his success. Crazy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, although a regional food product, is slowly expanding its market. It opened its national mail-order business in December with three small advertisments in the New Yorker magazine. According to <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, the calls are still coming in.

 Cadet <PERSON> Julianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Klejnot </PERSON> is out of uniform this day at <ORGANIZATION> Norwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and that's unprecedented in the 168-year history of the oldest private military college in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Instead of her standard green skirt and shirt, she is wearing blue jeans and a pink cotton warm-up jacket. She's one of three cadets on a work detail winterizing a widow's home off campus. The cadets form a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> squad that has invaded the military college in a pilot program designed to prepare students in their junior and senior years for the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> or other volunteer relief agencies. The program, the only one of its kind in the nation, is intended as an alternative to campus <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> and eventually military service. <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officials hope other colleges will follow suit and that the federal government will join with the schools and finance the training effort as it has done with <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> military training on 400 campuses. Other schools already have made inquiries to <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>. A bill is pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would authorize $ 5 million a year for five years to enable the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to test the program at other schools. <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION> went ahead on its own and added the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to its curriculum last September, and will foot the cost itself. The <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is campaigning to double its volunteers to 10,000 by 1992 and has challenged colleges to find ways to help. `` Because of programs like the one in <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>, we will be able to reach that goal,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> press officer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> liaison with universities, called the <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION> pilot program a promising model for other colleges and the forerunner of a federally sponsored plan of incentives for undergraduates to consider the volunteer service agency. Still, he acknowledged `` the irony of a military school preparing people for the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>.'' The impetus came from university President <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a retired general with 32 years of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> service including combat duty in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, his son and his father are all graduates of <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>. `` The most exciting thing about it is the way people perceive <ORGANIZATION> Norwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>. `` They've seen us as a bunch of Rambos. And when we've expressed our mission in terms of the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, we've had a very, very positive reaction from some people.'' <ORGANIZATION> Norwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> consists of two campuses and two student bodies, one military and one civilian. The <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> program has drawn students from each. The Military College was founded in 1819, and the murals and plaques on its walls attest to its heroes from the Mexican War of 1847 to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The civilian campus, <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, eight miles away in <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>, was founded in 1834 as a Methodist seminary. It was merged into <ORGANIZATION> Norwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1972 to allow a wider variety of programs and more opportunities for expansion. The military college has an enrollment of 1,300 cadets, including 81 women, while the civilian college has 900 students. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said he had been looking for a way to give the civilian part of the student body the sense of national service _ and when his wife, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, came back from a conference on volunteerism last summer, she told him, `` I found what we've been looking for.'' She had heard <PERSON> Loret </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, report on a proposal by Rev. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesburgh </PERSON>, president emeritus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>, that the federal government devise an <ORGANIZATION> ROTC-like </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> preparation program that colleges could incorporate. `` So rather than wait for the federal government to devise a program, we decided we'd experiment,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>. `` When I discussed it with the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, they were fascinated.'' But what surprised <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> was that the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> was not nearly as interested as he was in putting the program on the civilian campus. Instead, they wanted it on the military campus because of the cadet corps' physical and leadership training. A compromise was struck to make it available to students on both campuses. Only four students are enrolled in the first class, three of whom had been in <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> on the military campus and one from the civilian campus. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, who attributed the low enrollment to the program's newness last fall, said the goal is 60 students two years from now. The four students now enrolled are not sure whether they will go into the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Students are not committed to entering once they graduate, nor is the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> under obligation to accept them. As an incentive, <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION> is offering low interest loans of up to $ 5,000 to students in their senior year, then writing them off if they complete two years service in the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Military students at <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION> must take four years of <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION>, but service after graduation is optional. If they agree to accept a commission for active service after graduation, they are paid $ 100 a month in their last two years of college. Otherwise, they receive no monthly stipend while in school and go into the reserves upon graduation. Tuition, fees and room and board run $ 12,500 a year at <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>. Miss Klejnot, a 21-year-old junior biology major from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, initially enrolled in <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ROTC because she wanted to see what the military was like. But after 2 -LCB- years, she decided she did n't want to devote her future to a regulated life in the military. `` The Peace Corps option was available so I decided to see what it was like,'' she said. Even though she dropped ROTC, she still has to wear her uniform and attend three formations a day, a requirement for all cadets on the military campus. The Peace Corps program was designed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, the director and university chaplain, and a committee of faculty members who had worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and other volunteer agencies in Third World countries. May himself had worked with Cambodian refugees while serving as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> line officer in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He also went to the agencies themselves to find out why their volunteers did or did not complete their tours. The <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has a dropout rate of about 30 percent. May said he found that many volunteers have little community service experience and are frustrated once they arrive overseas. The <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION> program includes three hours of work in the community once a week, classroom studies of the Third World and a summer internship between the junior and senior years in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> working in the slums of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>. `` The whole emphasis in the military is to keep from going to war by strength,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>. `` The other half of the equation is to make friends and make the world a better place ... And you wo n't have to go to war either.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The 7,000-member military, long a dominant force in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, would be put to work building bridges and promoting public health under a reorganization plan drawn up by the nation's new leader. The plan, a key part of the 86-page platform of President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION>, also would separate the police from the armed forces and put them under civilian control. `` There is a perception the army was ... corrupted by the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship,'' the party document says. `` But there is another truth, also incontestable, that the army was the victim of the Duvalier dictatorship, which humiliated, dismantled and decapitated it.'' `` There must be a ... rehabilitation to wipe out the image that the army is a repressive force against the civilian population.'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> as a candidate and now president has acted as a buffer between the army and its harshest critics. He claims he can control the institution that has dominated politics in this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> country of 6 million people from the time <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1804. Following the end of the 19-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation in 1934, the army put <PERSON> Dumarsais </PERSON> <PERSON> Estime </PERSON> in as president in 1946, took power itself in 1950 under Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Magloire </PERSON>, and helped <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> win a disputed election that began a brutal 29-year dictatorship in 1957. <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> set up the <LOCATION> Tonton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macoutes </LOCATION> militia, which came to be generally regarded as street thugs, when the army and coast guard plotted against him. He emasculated <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s armed forces by shuffling, retiring and sometimes executing commanders. He based promotions on loyalty to him, and gave away state monopolies to his military favorites. When <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s son and successor, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> `` Baby Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, fled into exile in February 1986, a military-dominated junta led by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, then the army's chief of staff, took control and ruled by decree for two years leading up to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s election Jan. 17 and inauguration Feb. 7. Opposition leaders say it remains to be seen whether the army will return to the barracks as <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, now the commander in chief, had pledged before the election, and whether <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> has the power to reorganize or dismantle an entrenched military hierarchy. A Western diplomat who closely tracks political and military developments here said in an interview: `` All those who made officer between 1959 and 1971 were <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> appointees of very low quality. ... The officers who graduated in 1973 -LRB- two years after `` Baby Doc'' reopened the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ... see things differently. They're more progressive, they're more educated, they're more professional. `` But they're blocked by the system, they're blocked by the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> appointees above them _ the colonels, the generals _ who are not leaving,'' said the diplomat, speaking only on condition of anonymity. The military also has been linked to drug trafficking and to the smuggling of cars, rice, sugar and other goods. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> opened an office in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> in November because cocaine smuggling was rising so rapidly in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> informant, <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, testified in federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in January that the trafficking was taking place under the protection of Haitian soldiers. Armed Forces of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> officials rarely respond to such criticism or charges. The military is a closed, secretive organization. All interviews have to be cleared with Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s successor as chief of staff. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> did not respond to a written request for an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The present-day army structure was established by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> in 1916 to help put down a guerrilla-style insurrection. It is the main component of the armed forces, which also include the police, <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION>, fire department, a presidential guard and several other battalions and departmental commands. The armed forces' main role is to protect the president and maintain security _ a difficult task given their small numbers and inadequate equipment and training. The fire department is notoriously slow, and residents who have been robbed have to send their own cars to pick up police investigators. Military recruits, drawn from the lower middle class, are paid the equivalent of $ 160 a month on a pay scale that ranges up to $ 1,800 for colonels and $ 3,400 for <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, the top commander. Enlistment terms run for six years and the military is considered a good career in a country where more than half the population can not find steady work and the annual per capita income is about $ 350. Training is limited, and equipment consists mostly of aging hand-me-downs from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ M-1 rifles and M-14 automatic weapons, a half-dozen helicopters of which only two or three work, a few armored personnel carriers and some cutters that patrol the coast. For 7,000 men, fewer than a single <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> division, there are five generals and 24 colonels. While <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> is the commander in chief, the 500-man battalion at the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> acts semi-autonomously under Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. On Feb. 15 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> informant, linked <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to drug trafficking. The 35-year-old <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> businessman told a news conference that he personally arranged a 100-kilogram -LRB- 220-pound -RRB- cocaine shipment in December, 1986. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> said, `` We flew -LRB- the shipment -RRB- out of his own personal ranch in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s lawyer in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, said he was trying to arrange for <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee that is investigating alleged drug smuggling by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the Panamanian military strongman. The Dessalines battalion was involved in almost every incident last summer when soldiers shot and killed unarmed anti-government demonstators. The green-uniformed, black-booted battalion, which patrols streets in this sprawling capital of 1 million, was noticeably absent Nov. 29, however, when gunmen with hand grenades and automatic weapons killed at least 34 people and forced the cancellation of what would have been <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first free, open and independently run presidential election in 30 years. `` It is the only unit that is really feared here,'' the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said, noting that some of the <ORGANIZATION> Duvaliers </ORGANIZATION>' Tonton Macoutes were incorporated into it. `` The men are very loyal to -LRB- Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB-. He ignores the chain of command and commands them directly.'' Nevertheless, the diplomat said he was optimistic that <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> might succeed in his efforts to educate and modernize the armed forces, and reorient soldiers to accept civilian rule and participate in national development. `` The young officers aspire for change and they see it coming,'' the diplomat said. `` The problem remaining is the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>. We're waiting to see what <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> will do about that. `` In the next five years, we'll see a new generation of officers with diplomas who have traveled abroad, who are of a different mentality, who are young and cultured. They can give a new image to the army.'' A leading Haitian academic who has had a 30-year acquaintance with <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said he is not sure that will happen. Speaking only on the condition that he remain anonymous, fearing recrimination, he said: `` The army wants to leave the civilian structures of power, not power itself. There's too much money to be made. `` Manigat is no puppet. Far from it. It is an extremely interesting battle. He makes the army believe he supports it. The army makes him believe they support him. Each one knows the other is lying. ... `` In the final analysis, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> is not capable of dominating the army or manipulating power. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s immediate future is going to be as tragic as its present and its past. I fear uprisings among the people.''

 As lawyers for three tobacco companies and a man suing them for his wife's cancer death do battle inside a federal courtroom, another struggle goes on outside, this one waged by a squad of public relations people. At each break in the proceedings, PR specialists for the companies buttonhole reporters covering the trial, drop by the courthouse press room to say hello _ and make sure no questions need to be answered _ and happily provide transcripts of testimony favorable to their side, with key passages highlighted. The $ 22 billion-a-year tobacco industry has never shrunk from getting its message across, but some observers say this trial involving <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> presents an especially striking image problem. Lawyers for the man suing the three companies have spent 4 -LCB- years gathering an unprecedented quantity of confidential internal corporate documents and interviewing key company officials. In the first two weeks of the trial, for example, jurors have seen notes by a <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> vice president saying that selling a safer cigarette would increase the risk of cancer lawsuits involving existing products. A memo describing a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> officials and consultants says the company `` wanted to sell cigarettes so we must get over the hurdle of linking smoking and lung cancer.'' Last Thursday, the jury heard testimony from an assistant research director of <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> saying that the company blocked publication of research on a safer cigarette and his participation in a scientific conference. The trial is likely to last two to four months. The documents and testimony were introduced to bolster <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s contention that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> were responsible for the lung-cancer death of his wife <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a 40-year smoker. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> charges in part that the companies failed to do enough research on the health effects of smoking, to disclose adequately what research they did or to put a safer cigarette on the market. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> does n't have a PR staff but his two lawyers and their courtroom staff of three do n't stint on meeting the needs of reporters. They readily present their interpretation of the day's evidence during courtroom breaks, and make available copies of documents deemed newsworthy as soon as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> enters them into evidence Does the trial truly present an image problem for the industry? `` No, I do n't think so,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>, one of five PR professionals working on behalf of the tobacco companies. They attend court nearly every day and work out of an office rented in downtown <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. A lawyer from the prominent <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> firm of Shook, <ORGANIZATION> Hardy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> is also on hand to answer all legal questions from reporters. Inside the courtroom, a team of nine attorneys handles the defense. `` Our purpose here is just to keep things as clean as possible in terms of trying to keep the story straight,'' said <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>, the 52-year-old senior vice president of the international PR firm <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edelman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> has made his mark in the field in recent years by presenting litigants' positions from courthouse steps while lawyers handle the juries inside The bearded, straight-talking member of former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>'s administration handled the media in highly publicized libel trials for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> newspapers. `` Our role is ... to present a balanced, objective picture of what's going on,'' said <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> colleague <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilburg </PERSON>, who has his own PR firm in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and a joint venture in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` So many people enter with an anti-cigarette bias,'' he said. <PERSON> Hilburg </PERSON> represented <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in its legal battle with energy giant <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and worked on <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s campaign to recover from the devastation of the Tylenol-tampering incidents. Image could have an impact on Wall Street. Some analysts have said a legal loss in the suit _ which would be the industry's first in such a case _ could lower the value of tobacco company stocks. However, said analyst <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, `` It's hard to picture the tobacco companies' image as suffering, because I do n't think they have good images.

<HEAD>GAF Opts Out of Delaware Takeover Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to exempt itself from <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s new anti-takeover law reflects its own acquisitive philosophy rather than a groundswell of corporate opposition to the statute, experts say. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its board of directors voted to `` opt out'' of takeover protections included in the controversial law, making it the first major corporation to do so since the law took effect earlier this month. The company is considering a $ 1.2 billion buyout offer from a group led by chairman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, who has steered the chemical and building materials company through two major takeover battles as part of its acquisitive corporate strategy. In proposing a buyout last September, <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> said the move would allow <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> to pursue its takeover strategy without having to worry about the short-term earnings pressures faced by many publicly-held companies. The management-led group has offered $ 40 in cash and $ 8.50 worth of debt securities for each of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s roughly 27.7 million common shares outstanding. <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, who also is <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, controls about 10 percent of the outstanding shares. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 50 cents to close at $ 47.62 -LCB- a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The company is based in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, but is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, as are more than half of the Fortune 500 companies. A key provision of the new <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law would bar a potential buyer from acquiring a company for three years after the buyer accumulated more than 15 percent of the target company's stock. The provision would not apply if the buyer acquired a total of 85 percent of the company's shares in the same transaction that it passed the 15 percent threshold, or if the board of directors approved the takeover. The provision was aimed at `` bust-up'' deals where a hostile buyer sells off chunks of a target company in order to help finance the buyout, and partial offers where the buyer acquires just enough shares to win control of the target and offers the remaining shareholders a lesser price for their stock. State-chartered companies have 90 days from the law's effective date to exempt themselves from the law. After the 90-day period, a corporation may exempt itself only by a shareholders' vote. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which have made pending hostile buyout offers for Delaware-incorporated companies, have filed lawsuits challenging the new law as unconstitutional. In announcing the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> board's action, <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> criticized the law as an example of the proliferation of state anti-takeover laws, which he said helped entrench managements at the expense of shareholders. `` This is an expression of our company's corporate governance philosophy,'' <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` And we simply wanted to lend support to the effort in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for federal pre-emption of state anti-takeover laws.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> also released a letter from <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> urging <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, chairman of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, to press <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pre-empt anti-takeover legislation in the states. The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> management group's buyout bid is unlikely to turn hostile, but the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law could impede <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>'s takeover strategy by putting restraints on <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> attempts to acquire other companies. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> made an unsuccessful hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which eventually agreed to a buyout by a group led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In late 1985, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> made an unsuccessful but highly profitable attempt to take over <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> withdrew after <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> undertook a major defensive restructuring, but made about $ 250 million in profit by selling the <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> stock it had accumulated <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to exempt itself probably does not signal a trend among Delaware-incorporated companies, experts said. Many of the thousands of major companies incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> pushed for approval of the law, and are deemed unlikely to forego its protection.

<HEAD>Burger King Emphasizes Flame-Broiling in New Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> hopes to reignite sales growth with an advertising campaign that invokes the memory of the flame-broiling-versus-frying debate that engulfed the fast-food industry in the early 1980s. The campaign employs the theme `` We do it like you'd do it'' and pitches <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s flame-broiling process as the one which burger-lovers prefer. The campaign contains some reminders of the hard-hitting ads of 1982 in which Burger King asserted that tests showed people preferred its flame-broiled hamburgers to those from the industry leader, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> objected, saying its burgers are grilled and not fried The exchange became known as the Burger Wars. McDonald's name is only mentioned once in the new Burger King ads, which were previewed for the media Tuesday in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel room decorated to look like a backyard complete with sod, a barbecue pit, lawnmower and picnic tables. In one new ad, a kindergartener discovers that her Burger King hamburger has `` lines'' from broiling. She likes the taste and asks a friend why she never gets similar lines on burgers from <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. Her pal shrugs. In another ad, a foreign exchange student savors a broiled Burger King hamburger, and complains to some friends that hamburgers are usually fried in his country. When told that some burger places fry them here too, the student registers his disbelief with a long `` Noooooo.'' The ads begin appearing Feb. 29, and <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> reportedly plans to spend about $ 200 million putting them on the air and in print over the next year. The approach, created by the agency N.W. <ORGANIZATION> Ayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, replaces the `` <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>'' theme that had been created by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> was selected for the Burger King account last fall. Burger King officials, speaking on condition they not be identified by name, said consumers liked the `` Best Food'' and `` This is a Burger King Town'' campaigns created by <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> but failed to remember the characteristic that separates Burger King from other hamburger chains _ flame-broiling. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olcott </PERSON>, president of the Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, said the company's average sales per store had stalled. Burger King's average sales per store cracked $ 1 million for the first time in 1985 but rose to only $ 1.02 million in the year ended May 31, 1987. McDonald's had average sales per store of $ 1.37 million in 1986, and has about 7,400 stores nationwide compared with 4,700 for Burger King. They are the leaders in the fast-food market, which the trade magazine Advertising Age estimates at $ 60 billion. Hamburgers account for roughly half of the figure. Another hamburger chain, <ORGANIZATION> Wendy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, recently began airing new versions of an old campaign. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, are fighting for third place in hamburgers, analysts say. The agency, <PERSON> Backer </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielvogel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, has created some new versions of a 2 -LCB- - year-old campaign for <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s, known as `` Hamburger A-Hamburger B. The campaign spoofs consumer taste-tests as an interviewer asks someone in each ad to choose between a fresh-looking <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s Hamburger A and an unappetizing Hamburger B A truck driver picks B in one ad, and beams that he can have one `` in <LOCATION> Shakeytown </LOCATION> and still be tasting it in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>.'' In another, a woman trying to lose weight said she'd pick B because she would n't be tempted to eat it. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s used humor to boost sales in 1984 when its advertising asked, `` Where's the Beef?'' <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s average sales per store peaked at about $ 861,000 in 1984, but slipped to $ 767,000 in 1986, according to spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. With the new ads and the installation of SuperBars that offer all-you-can-eat Mexican or Italian food or salads in about a third of its 3,600 domestic restaurants, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s sales are picking up, said another spokesman, <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. He added the company expects `` a gradual improvement through the year.''

 A proposed merger of the tire-making divisions of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would give a Japanese company control of the world's third-largest tire company, experts say. Firestone, which was fifth in worldwide tire sales in 1986, announced the plan to merge its tire business with No. 3 <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. Based on 1986 tire sales figures _ the most recent available _ of $ 2.3 billion for Firestone and about $ 3.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would rank third behind <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. More important, the joint venture, with majority ownership by <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, would give the Japanese company a share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> original-equipment tire market, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Noga </PERSON>, editor of the industry trade journal <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` Bridgestone is an aggressive company that wants to grow in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and they wanted to get access to the original-equipment market,'' <PERSON> Noga </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where Firestone's tire division is based. Chicago-based Firestone has been successful in obtaining original-equipment contracts, meaning it supplies tires to car and truck manufacturers to be used on new vehicles. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> made the surprise announcement of an `` agreement in principle'' with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> and said it would `` enter into formal negotiations immediately to reach a final agreement.'' Firestone stock soared $ 9.25 to $ 45 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Tuesday following the disclosure. The announcement came amid speculation that Firestone would sell its tire division to the Italian tire manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> would own about 75 percent of the company, and <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> 25 percent. The two companies plan to operate the joint venture, doing business worldwide as <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, as `` a relatively autonomous business unit, subject to the direction and control of a board of directors consisting of persons representing the owners,'' the statement said. Under the tentative agreement, the joint venture would be initially financed with $ 750 million in equity from <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, $ 250 million from Firestone and $ 500 million in debt. The agreement also calls for Firestone to transfer tire assets and liabilities with an equity value of about $ 1.5 billion to the joint venture. After spinning off the tire business, Firestone would still retain its 1,500 car-care centers; Firestone Diversified Products, which includes divisions that manufacture industrial and building products; <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synthetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures synthetic rubber and operates a rubber plantation in <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Firestone tire division employs 30,000 people worldwide, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON>. The rest of Firestone's businesses employ 23,500, he said. The creation of the joint venture is expected to generate more than $ 1 billion in cash for the parent <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. Once final agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> is reached, <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> would schedule a special shareholders meeting to seek approval of the joint venture. The company also would ask shareholders to approve a financial restructuring that `` would distribute a very substantial portion of the cash generated by the transaction'' to <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, the statement said. The joint venture's headquarters would be located in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> and would be assigned the exclusive right to use Firestone's name on tires throughout the world. In a related move Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s board adopted a `` poison pill'' anti-takeover plan to guard against unfriendly suitors. The plan would take effect if any person or group buys 20 percent or more of Firestone's common stock without the approval of the company's board of directors. The Firestone statement said the anti-takeover plan was `` intended both to ensure that <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s shareholders will retain the benefits of a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> and to protect the full value of its shareholders' investment in the company Firestone is the third-largest U.S.-based tire manufacturer, behind <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> B.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> held a 2 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> replacement passenger tire market last year and had a 7 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> replacement truck tire market, according to <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, an industry publication <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> is in the process of moving its <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters from <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> LaVergne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where it operates its sole <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing plant, a truck-tire factory, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, publisher of Modern Tire Journal. Firestone put its tire division in a free-standing position last November when the top headquarters staff relocated from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and the company will seek shareholder approval next month to change the name of the company to <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, wants the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to explain why it decided not to pursue an in-depth review of an attempted takeover of Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> transportation subcommittee, has scheduled a hearing on the matter for today The commissioners of the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> were scheduled to testify as was Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> antitrust subcommittee. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> has said the takeover raises the possibility of reduced competition in several cities, higher prices, less consumer choice and a substantial loss of jobs. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said Tuesday that documents suggest the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> based its decision on state and regional impact rather than on individual metropolitan areas. He said that according to an <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> memorandum, the agency's staff recommended against seeking additional information on the proposed merger between <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> on the basis of the competitive situations in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as a whole. In other cases of department store mergers, <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has used individual metropolitan areas to gauge potential anticompetitive effects. `` They've used a totally false basis for denying the heart of competition,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tichnor </PERSON> said the agency declined comment. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> operates about 650 retail stores in 36 states and had sales exceeding $ 11 billion in 1987. Its holdings include the New York-based chains of <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Bullocks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, a retailing and real estate development company, on Tuesday sweetened its bid for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> to $ 66 a share, or about $ 5.85 billion in cash, but <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> rejected it _ saying <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> lacked adequate financing for the takeover. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> memo, of particular competitive concern were Federated stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that compete with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION> stores. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said that based on 1982 figures, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> held only 15 percent of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> department store market compared with 7.7 percent for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, each company held 16.4 percent of the market, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Although this acquisition would combine the first - and third-largest department store chains in the country, we do not feel that it raises competitive concerns,'' the memo concluded <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> bought Allied Stores in December 1986, then sold several divisions of the company. However, it retained several retailing chains including <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> politicians are worried that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> will buy <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, sell major portions of the company and fire or lay off large numbers of its employees. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> operates 63 stores in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, employing about 16,000 workers in the state. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> has spurned <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> three times. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s initial $ 47-a-share, $ 4.2 billion takeover offer as inadequate. It later turned down an improved $ 61-a-share, $ 5.4 billion bid as well as Tuesday's increased offer because it was not convinced <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had the necessary financing.

 An offer by <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> to increase its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is a shrewd move intended to put the Canadian company's imprint on any restructuring plans, analysts say. The Toronto-based real estate company, which seeks to increase its interest in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> from 10.5 percent to 19.9 percent, launched a $ 245 million offer Tuesday for up to 14 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York offer, which expires at midnight March 13, hinges on payment by <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fe </PERSON> of a special dividend. The cash portion was paid Tuesday, and the debenture payment is set for March 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> offer amounts to $ 17.50 per share. It is challenging a plan by <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to wage a proxy fight for control of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. `` I think Olympia & amp; York are trying to make sure they have a controlling position in the company,'' said <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Benham </PERSON>, an analyst at <LOCATION> Printon </LOCATION>, Kane In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think it's a smart move.'' <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> is </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder with 15.7 percent. It plans to wage a proxy fight in opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 4.7 billion restructuring plan, which is seen as an effort to stop <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s advances Olympia & amp; York supported the restructuring, and its representatives have been nominated to two seats on the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe board. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, which has about 156.2 million shares outstanding, said it had been informed of <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> York </PERSON>'s tender offer but had no comment, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said company Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON> was `` pleased with the move,'' but he would not elaborate. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> restructuring plan, shareholders would receive $ 25 in cash and $ 5 in subordinated debentures per share. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> has said the debentures are another effort by <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> to prevent a takeover, and is challenging them in court. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has set Feb. 26 as the date for a preliminary hearing on the issue. A debenture is a debt repayable within a specified time and bearing a fixed rate of interest which must be paid whether or not the company issuing it makes a profit. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, citing the effects of the restructuring plan, said it downgraded the securities ratings of <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries, the <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said the downgrade was based on the `` substantial weakening in the parent's debt-protection measurements because of a recent corporate restructuring. About $ 1.4 billion of securities are affected.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> will significantly expand its market share in the tampon field with the acquisition of the maker of <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> tampons, analysts say. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said it has agreed to pay $ 726 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> division that makes the tampons. The addition of <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> would give the health care giant more than 30 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tampon market, of which it already has about 6 percent with the O.B. brand tampon, one analyst said. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the leading manufacturer of sanitary napkins in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> said in a joint announcement that the transaction is still subject to government approval. <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> is one of three operating subsidiaries of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, itself once part of <ORGANIZATION> BCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company formed by the April 1986 leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>. The Family Products Divsion also makes disposable baby nursers, household gloves and toothbrushes. The division accounts for half the company's sales and 70 percent of its profits, said Chairman <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON>. The other two divisions are <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jhirmack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of hair care products, and <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION>, a leading worldwide manufacturer of bras, girdles and pantyhose. Proceeds from the sale of the Family Products Division would go towards paying off debt incurred in the December 1986 leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> from BCI, said <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON>, who had been chairman of BCI's consumer products division. He said the Jhirmack division would likely go on the selling block next week. The divestments would allow <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> to concentrate on its intimate apparel lines, <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON> said. The apparel division last year had operating profits of $ 45 million on sales of $ 300 million. Analyst <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Olwell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> estimated sales from <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> tampons at $ 125 million, or about 25 percent of the more than $ 500 million domestic tampon market, and sales from the other family products lines at about $ 100 million. <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION>' Tampex line is the market leader with 55 percent, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s more than one-third of the sanitary napkin market should give it leverage in finding shelf and distribution space for the <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> line, said Ms. <PERSON> Olwell </PERSON>. Its experience in feminine hygiene products should also allow for cost savings.

<HEAD>Company Settles for $3.65 Million in Hunt Silver Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A company accused along with the Hunt brothers of cornering the silver market in 1980 agreed to pay a Peruvian company $ 3.65 million in an out-of-court settlement, a Minpeco SA attorney said. <ORGANIZATION> AML </ORGANIZATION> Futures is the last of six financial institutions accused by <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> of participating in an illegal price manipulation scheme that drove up silver prices that led to substantial losses for the company, owned by the government of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The Hunts claim they did nothing illegal when they began pouring money into the silver market. From August 1979 to March 1980, the price of silver rose from $ 9 an ounce to $ 50 an ounce before the market collapsed to about $ 10 an ounce. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Thursday in the trial against the Hunts _ <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> _ before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Opening arguments in the case are scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 24. The AML Futures settlement and those by the other institutions add up to $ 64.65 million, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Cole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Corrette, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, firm that represents <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>. Minpeco, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s largest precious metals distributor, seeks to recover $ 150 million in damages. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> AML </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- now part of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ContiCommodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> unit and <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION> have reached out-of-court agreements with Minpeco since 1986. The original damage claim was for $ 225 million to $ 252 million that <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> said it lost in trading losses and potential profits because of silver market manipulations in late 1979 and early 1980 by the Hunt brothers. On Dec. 22, <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> must subtract from its damage claim profits made when silver bullion prices skyrocketed, and could not sue for lost potential profits. These rulings reduced the amount of the claim to $ 150 million. The Hunts also are facing two class action suits by more than 17,000 silver futures investors, who claim that illegal market manipulation caused them losses.

<HEAD>Chrysler Raises Prices An Average 4.6 Percent on its Mitsubishi

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it has raised prices on its imported <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> cars an average 4.6 percent over comparably equipped 1987 models. The new prices, announced Tuesday, also were higher in most cases than tentative prices used since the model year began in October, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. The increases followed a debate between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and various Japanese automakers in which Chrysler charged the Japanese companies may be dumping cars and trucks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. Dumping is selling foreign products here for less than in their home market. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has maintained the Japanese companies probably have n't increased prices enough to reflect the dramatic jump in the value of the Japanese yen against the dollar in the past two years The dumping debate heated up at news conferences preceding last weekend's opening of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Auto Show, where <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also introduced a new Japanese car, the Mitsubishi-built Eagle Summit, for its Jeep-Eagle lineup. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> charged that if the Japanese were dumping, so were the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers who sell imported Japanese cars under their own nameplates. Of the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is the most dependent on Japanese imports. About 11 percent of its cars and 40 percent of its light trucks are built by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were charging less for imported Japanese cars sold under American nameplates than were Japanese companies who made the cars. At the prices announced Tuesday, a base <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> two-door hatchback will start at $ 5,998, down from $ 6,005 for a comparable 1987 model and up from the tentative 1988 price of $ 5,899. At the other extreme, the base price on the sporty <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conquest </ORGANIZATION> TSi coupe rose to $ 18,683 from $ 18,005 on a comparable 1987 model and up from the tentative 1988 price of $ 18,155, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON>, industry analyst with <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said Japanese automakers have held down prices on their entry-level cars and made up the difference on higher-priced models. Automakers value entry-level buyers because of the chance they will become loyal customers and buy more expensive cars from the same company later.

<HEAD>Iacocca Announces Plan For Kenosha Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chariman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> says his company will establish an estimated $ 20 million trust fund to help the 5,500 autoworkers at its <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant meet housing, education and other needs after they lose their jobs when the factory closes Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who has threatened to sue <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> over the plant closing, called the announcement `` a good first step,'' but that the automaker must do more to avoid the possibility of ending up in court. Leaders and members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autoworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72, which represents 5,000 hourly workers at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, were less enthusiastic. About 80 union members set up a picket line outside the hotel where <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> held a news conference to announce the trust fund, the money for which would come from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s profits on all its cars sold in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> this year. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said based on 1987 sales, the Chrysler-Kenosha Trust Fund should grow to about $ 20 million by the end of the year. It would be administered by a seven-member board of trustees appointed by state and local officials and by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and its dealer organizations. `` We are not interested in a charity program that is financed only if <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars are sold,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON>, bargaining chairman for Local 72. `` We want jobs. He could have said I will keep my word and keep the plant open.'' <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> also said the offer of a $ 20 million trust fund was too little. `` Our attorneys tell us the damages in this case are $ 1 billion,'' <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said, adding that figure includes the plant's total payroll for five years But leaders of the national <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> were warmer in their reaction. `` Chrysler should ... be commended for showing a degree of responsiveness in this painful situation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the trust fund would be in addition to approximately $ 1.3 million that the company will give governments to repay for capital improvements such as roads. It would also be in addition to benefits guaranteed workers in the contract between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and benefits negotiated by the union in a plant closing agreement, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> stressed, however, there was no way he would change his mind about closing the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> carmaking plant, which is scheduled to shut down this summer. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will still employ about 1,000 people in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> at an engine plant. `` The decision to close <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> was a crummy call but one we had to make. Time and the marketplace just caught up with an 86-year old plant,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also said the company's decision to close the plant did not break any contracts with the state regarding the future of the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> facility. `` We are guilty as hell of being cockeyed optimists and we are paying the price for the optimism right now,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the company had hoped to continue building cars in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for three-to-five years but car sales were not good enough to allow that. `` What we did unintentionally was to create expectations that could n't be fulfilled,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the decision to establish the trust fund should not be viewed as a precedent for other auto plant closings. He said <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> was a unique situation because of the impact the closing will have on a relatively small city. <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>'s population is about 75,000. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s threats to file a lawsuit against the nation's third largest automaker were not a factor in setting up the trust fund. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said he, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., would meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday He said he hoped an agreement would be reached eventually that would avoid the need for the state and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> to meet in the courtroom.

<HEAD>Premier Says Government May Expand Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said Wednesday the government may expand its subsidies of major commodities to cut the inflation rate, which hit 7.5 percent last year. In a speech marking the Lunar New Year, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told a crowd of about 6,000 at the Great Hall of the People that the rapid rise in prices, especially for food, was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most pressing economic problem, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> admonished governments at all levels to make price stability a priority and said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cabinet, is considering ways of expanding the subsidy program `` However, we should not follow the road as we did in the past where prices were rigidly controlled by administrative means,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> did not specify which price subsidies would be increased or by how much, or whether price supports would be introduced for non-subsidized items. Any such move would be a dramatic step away from the government's goal of gradually ending price controls and letting market forces take over. Subsidies for non-staple foods, including vegetables, have been gradually lifted in the past few years and the government has reduced the proportion of grain and other staples sold at subsidized prices. The subsidies are believed to be a major contributor to the government deficit, which rose 14 percent in 1987 to 8 billion yuan, or $ 2.1 billion.

<HEAD>EEC Predicts Slow Growth, But No Recession in 1988-89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic growth in the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will drop below 2 percent this year and in 1989 as a result of the stock market crisis last fall, a report released Thursday said. But the report by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> executive <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> predicted there would be no economic recession. The Commission said that the turmoil on the world's financial markets late last year has `` increased the uncertainties in the world economy'' and upset earlier economic predictions for a 2.5 percent average growth in the Common Market. EEC economists said this level of growth is too low to bring about a reduction in the rate of unemployment, which currently stands at 11.5 percent. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidhuber </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> commissioner for economic affairs, told a news conference the analysis was based on the assumption the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar will stay stable at 1.60 German marks and 125 yen through the next two years. Changes on the financial markets `` would have profound implications'' for the European economies and could offset any national efforts to stimulate growth, <PERSON> Schmidhuber </PERSON> said. The Commission said the slow growth will be caused largely by a decline in the growth of domestic demand and sluggish industrial investments. Exports, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said, will remain flat in 1988, while imports will increase by about 7 percent. Inflation, although up against 1987, will remain between 3 percent and 5 percent. According to the report, virtually all <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries will experience a decline in economic growth compared with 1987. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> should contribute to economic growth of its member states by stimulating cooperation in research and development, investing in large infrastructure products and improving the regulatory climate.

The men were accused of four separate schemes at the Board of Trade and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a former trader in <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index-futures contracts, pleaded guilty Tuesday to two counts of commodities fraud. The plea agreement states that he defrauded his former employee, <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, by diverting money from profitable S & amp; P futures trades to four accounts between January 1984 and July 1986. Under the agreement, the government reserves the right to grant <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> certain immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Alesia </PERSON> set April 7 for sentencing. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine.

The indictment says <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> placed orders to buy or sell <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures contracts, then turned the trading cards over to a co-defendant. If the position turned out to be profitable, the trades were cleared, but if they turned out to be losers, <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> and the others could walk away from the loss and it could not be traced, according to the indictment.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Fall In January</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing construction fell 1.9 percent in January to its lowest level since the end of the last recession, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new homes and apartments were being built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million units last month. The January setback, which followed a 15.5 percent plunge in December, surprised analysts who had been forecasting a modest rebound in construction activity. The housing sector is being watched closely at present since it is often one of the first sectors to turn down at the start of a new recession. While the majority of economists believe the country will be able to escape a downturn in this presidential election year, some forecasters dispute this outlook, in part because of concern about the record collapse of stock prices last October. The January annual starts level was the slowest pace since a rate of 1.30 million units in December 1982, just as the last recession was ending. The January pace was almost 24 percent below the rate at the beginning of 1987. The weakness last month came from a 2.9 percent decline in construction of single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate of 1.01 million units. This drop offset a 0.8 percent increase in construction of multi-family housing, wich edged up to an annual rate of 366,000 units, still 35 percent below the level of a year ago. This sector has been in a slump because of the impact of the 1986 tax law, which removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real estate. In other ominous news, permits, considered a good sign of future activity, fell an even sharper 8.2 percent in January to an annual rate of 1.25 million units, the lowest level for permits since January 1985. Permits had fallen 7.4 percent in December. The January weakness in construction starts came from two sectors of the country. Starts fell 21.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 223,000 units and dropped 17.1 percent in the South to 469,000 units. These declines were partially offset by a 27.6 percent increase in starts in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where homes were being built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 291,000 units, and a 21.2 percent increase in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where starts rose to a rate of 394,000 units.

<HEAD>EEC Investigates Alleged Dumping By Japanese TV Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it was investigating allegations that seven Japanese photocopier manufacturers were `` dumping'' their products, or selling them for less than they do in their home market. The Commission also said it began an inquiry into whether <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> companies were dumping small color television sets in the European market. The Commission said the Japanese companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Konishiroku </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Minolta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ricoh </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> _ were accused of making photocopiers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> using mainly components from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to get around a 20 percent anti-dumping duty on photocopier imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> decided a year ago to impose the duties, affecting the $ 1 billion photocopier market. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> companies account for only 15 percent of the market. The Commission said that the latest complaint alleged that the Japanese companies had started or increased production of photocopiers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> when an initial anti-dumping inquiry started. The complaint also charged that the value of the Japanese components in the photocopiers exceeded by 50 percent the value of all the other components used to make the machines. In the case involving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a group of European consumer electronics companies had complained that Korean imports were increasing by more than 100 percent a year and that prices of the television sets were considerably lower than those charged by <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> manufacturers. The prices undercut <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> producers by as much as 38 percent, forcing <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> manufacturers to cut prices, according to the industry complaint. EEC producers were alleged to have lost 6 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> market as a result of the Korean dumping at a time when consumption rose by 11 percent, the domestic industry claimed.

<HEAD>Government Worried At Trend Toward Even Later Filings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the trend by many taxpayers to delay filing their federal tax returns continues to spread, the federal government could feel the pinch _ right in the pocketbook. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, notes that five years ago, 14 percent of all individual returns were filed in January and 34 percent in April. But last year, only 4 percent were filed during the first month and almost 40 percent in April. `` If this trend were exacerbated by tax reform -LRB- the sweeping 1986 law -RRB-, it could jam the system by slowing down processing and the issuance of refunds,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Tuesday. `` As a result, there could be a high price to pay. `` If we do n't process returns within a 45-day period after the return due date the government must pay interest on refunds,'' he noted. That due date is April 15. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is not ready to push the panic button, even though 9.7 percent fewer returns have been filed this year than during the same period in 1987. Just a week ago, that gap was 17.5 percent. `` It does not appear that there is an easy solution to reversing the trend'' toward late filing, <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. He cited surveys finding that the chief reasons for later filing include simply procrastinating and failure to receive some information necessary to prepare a return. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is not sure how the new tax law, with its lower rates, reduced deductions and higher personal exemptions, will affect the late-filing trend. Some returns are simpler under the new law; others are more complicated. The backlog of unprocessed returns at the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> was down to 11.5 million last week, compared with 12.9 million at this time last year. The number of couples and individuals receiving refunds, 1.7 million, also dropped, from 1.9 million. The average refund was up 13 percent, to $ 743. By the end of the tax-filing season, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects that about 80 percent of the 107 million returns will qualify for refunds. But no one can say with a great degree of certainty, because of the new tax law and the fact that most workers filed new tax-withholding forms with their employers last year. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is watching closely to determine whether a significant number of Americans may have had too little tax withheld from paychecks last year an, thus, would owe the government when they file. `` Pockets of underwithholding among certain groups of taxpayers, such as high-income taxpayers, working couples and young wage earners, could exist,'' he said. Because of confusion about the new law and a complex W-4 withholding form, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to waive underpayment penalties if too little was withheld from 1987 wages. That amnesty does not apply for 1988 earnings. Despite more personnel, more equipment and a desire to see that taxpayers get all the information and forms they need, `` We are concerned that the complexity of the law and the volume of changes will provide us ample opportunities to make mistakes,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaube </PERSON>, director of taxpayer services. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, offered some rare words of praise for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, after studying reports that found <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees in the past sometephone questions from taxpayers, decided to test the improvements that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has been bragging about. Last week, he said, he assigned eight members of his staff to call <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> `` assistors'' around the nation with some questions. `` Not one staff member who discussed a particular problem ... encountered anyone on the other end of the line except a very courteous, friendly <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employee who almost went overboard to help,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. His staff is still checking the answers to the questions. But one thing is sure, <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said: It often took several tries to ring an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> number and not get a busy signal.

<HEAD>Industrial Output Up, Housing Starts Down in January</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with January industrial output
figures. Uppicks 4th graf pvs: They have...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial output rose 0.2 percent, while housing construction dropped by 1.9 percent in January, the governemnt reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said production at American factories, mines and utilities increased for the fourth consecutive month _ despite a sharp drop in the production of autos _ following gains of 0.4 percent in both November and December. Those gains helped push the production level up by 6 percent in the past 12 months, providing further evidence of the strength in the manufacturing sector. The weaker dollar has been a major benefit to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry, making American products competitive once more on overseas markets and boosting exports to record levels. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said January's seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing construction stood at 1.38 million units a month, the lowest level since the end of the last recession. Some analysts had expected a small rebound in the building of new homes and apartments, following December's 15.5 percent plunge in December. They have been keeping a close eye on the housing sector, since it is often one of the first sectors to turn down at the start of a new recession. But the jury is still out on that question. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks that the economy appears to be balanced riled the bond market, but Wall Street ignored him and gave the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average its best showing in more than a month. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> speech Tuesday were interpreted by bond traders as a signal that the nation's central bank wo n't move quickly to push interest rates down to stimulate the economy, as had been widely expected. He spoke against a background of government statistics that suggested the economy is n't slowing down, despite the warning signs given by the stock crash four months ago. On Friday, for example, the government reported that the nation's trade deficit shrank in December and inflation increased. The 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond, the most closely watched issue, fell about $ 10 per $ 1,000 in face value after <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> spoke, though the price recovered somewhat later. The bond's yield, which moves inversely to price and can be a sensitive indicator of interest rates, rose to 8.46 percent from 8.43 percent late Friday. On Wall Street, investors largely overlooked <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks and the bond market's reaction, buying stocks in a late-afternoon rally that baffled strategists because signs of higher interest rates usually depress stock prices. The Dow Jones average rose 22.71 points to 2,005.97, its first finish above 2,000 since Jan. 8, when computerized selling and a presidential panel's report on the October stock crash sent the index down 140.58 points to 1,911.31. The value of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks rose $ 16.9 billion Tuesday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> 5,000 Equity Index. In other economic news Tuesday, a national real estate trade group said sales of existing homes steadied in 1987 at close to 4 million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the stock market collapse. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing single-family homes and condominiums totaled 3.885 million units last year, down 0.3 percent from the 1986 level of 3.897 million units. Sales in both years were the fastest pace of this decade.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today boosted to $ 61 a share its tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and promised to sweeten the offer again to $ 66 a share if <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> agrees to be acquired by midnight Sunday. The move came a day after the giant retailer's board rejected <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s separate proposal to pay $ 66 a share, or about $ 5.85 billion, for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> in a definitive merger agreement. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board, meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday, instead approved a financial restructuring that could include the sale of most assets other than the company's department stores. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its tender offer to $ 61 a share, or about $ 5.4 billion, from the $ 47 a share, roughly $ 4.2 billion, it initially offered on Jan. 25. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> rejected the initial tender offer as inadequate. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock fell $ 2.87 -LCB- to $ 60.87 -LCB- a share in early <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> also has rejected <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s alternative offer for a definitive merger agreement twice, including the latest $ 66 proposal and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s initial $ 61 a share offer, because it was not convinced <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had the necessary financing. But <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Joele <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today that `` financing for a $ 66 bid is absolutely solid.'' On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, developer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON> agreed to increase his previously announced $ 400 million loan to $ 480 million to help support the buyout. <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> family, through its <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, has agreed to buy a $ 260 million interest in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had agreed to provide $ 200 million each in equity and to coax another $ 100 million in equity from other banks. The developer reiterated today that <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter it is `` highly confident'' it could provide up to $ 1 billion in bridge financing. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it will increase its tender offer to $ 66 a share if <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> `` enters into a definitive agreement'' to be acquired by midnight Sunday. The tender offer is conditioned upon `` certain recently enacted anti-takeover legislation being invalidated'' or not applicable to the offer, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The developer is challenging a new anti-takeover law in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> as unconstitutional. While <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> is based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, it is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said Tuesday its bankers and financial advisers studied the latest bid and decided that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> did not have the financing for such a transaction and that `` its ability to arrange financing continued to be questionable.'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said its investment bankers believed the company's shareholders could be hurt if <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> entered into an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and the transaction could n't be completed at the specified price The <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board of directors then authorized negotiations with other unspecified parties that have shown an interest in buying <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> or some of the company's assets. The company said in a statement: `` The board also considered a restructuring plan, which would involve sales of most of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s non-department store assets, the possible issuance of preferred stock, and either an extraordinary dividend or the repurchase of more than 50 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s outstanding stock. `` The board requested that management proceed intensively with the further development of such a plan, and authorized management to negotiate the terms of such preferred stock and to obtain prompt bids for all of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s non-department store assets.'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s directors said a shareholders' rights plan adopted by the board last month would take effect Thursday. The plan, known as a `` poison pill'' defense, is designed to discourage an unwanted takeover by making such a move more expensive. The company, which operates about 650 stores in 36 states and had sales exceeding $ 11 billion in 1987, said Nov. 28 it had 88.5 million shares outstanding. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said it spent the weekend negotiating with numerous parties, including <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986. Among those believed to be interested is the takeover specialist firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Last week, in a letter to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> warned that any agreement between <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> would be challenged in court. After the Allied purchase, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sold several Allied divisions but retained several retailing chains, including <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s holdings include the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Bullocks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>

The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recently targeted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for sales of 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, but the market has been disappointed at the Soviets' slowness in buying the grain, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst in <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're really taking their sweet time about it and waiting for prices to drop down,'' <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said. Corn prices declined on prospects for increased farmer selling, he said. In early trading, wheat was 2 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 3.27 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to -LCB- cent lower with March at $ 1.97 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 \ cents lower with March at $ 1.89 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to 2 \ cents higher with March at $ 6.22 a Livestock and meat futures were sharply lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures led the declines in reaction to Tuesday's monthly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cattle-on-feed report showing a larger number of cattle being fattened for slaughter than the market had expected, analysts said. Live cattle were .45 cent to .87 cent lower with February at 71.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .97 cent lower with March at 82.40 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent to .60 cent lower with February at 47.00 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to .80 cent lower with February at 55.00 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its pre-tax profit fell 5.4 percent in its fiscal third quarter from the same period a year ago. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest airline said the profit for the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to 35 million pounds, or $ 61 million, from 37 million pounds, or $ 64 million, in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per American Depositary Share totaled 59 cents, based on an exchange rate of $ 1.83 per pound as of Dec. 31, compared with 74 cents, based on an exhange rate of $ 1.47 per pound, in the year-earlier quarter, company said. The company declined to provide specific reasons for these profit declines. Quarterly sales rose 10 percent to 881 million pounds, or $ 1.5 billion, from 801 million pounds, or $ 1.4 billion. The company said the results exclude those of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caledonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> acquired for 250 million pounds. For the nine-month period ended Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said it earned 174 million pounds, or 24.2 pence a share, compared with 173 million pounds, or 24 pence, a share. Earnings per American Depositary Share in the nine months totaled $ 4.43, compared with $ 3.53 in the same period of 1986, the airline said. Sales over the period gained 12 percent to 2.8 billion pounds from 2.5 billion pounds a year earlier. The company said those results were affected by a 10 percent increase in operating costs over that period; costs for new aircraft and a 20 percent increase in expenditures for fuel.

<TEXT>
 The obscure cargo airline that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces questions about its safety record as the government decides whether it is fit to carry passengers. Few air travelers have ever heard of <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> cargo carrier which serves such air freight companies as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Emery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> and Purolator. But if labor strife intensifies at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, many of that airline's customers may find themselves with tickets to fly <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> _ and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up scrutiny of the airline. Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, including the leasing of 26 of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s jetliners, that call on the airline to take over much of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s routes if pilots and mechanics go on strike. Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own pilots and ground workers, Eastern officials said. But the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has yet to approve <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> for passenger service, and a senior agency official said Tuesday that an enforcement proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> because of past safety violations. An <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection report on <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> shows `` a large number of serious safety infractions,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for aviation standards <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> said the airline's management has taken actions `` to permit <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> to safely operate its cargo business'' and training and maintenance procedures `` are being corrected to prevent similar occurrences in the future.'' At congressional hearings Tuesday, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said problems cited by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> have been corrected. <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s safety record excellent and maintained that much of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns stemmed from a `` misunderstanding'' by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors about <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s method of record keeping. `` Orion Air responded to each of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed findings last summer and are still in the process of resolving these issues. Obviously, if any of the issues compromised air safety, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> would not have allowed <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> to continue to operate,'' <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> continued. But Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> government operations and transportation subcommittee, called <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> `` an airline in near-shambles'' and raised questions about its fitness to fly passengers In an interview, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolski </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> executives believe <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s past safety problems have been resolved. He expressed confidence that the airline's fitness will be assured before the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> allows it to engage in passenger-carrying flights. `` We got a report that said they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are a hell of a lot better today than they were a year ago and that most, if not all, of their problems were behind them and they were in good shape,'' said <PERSON> Kolski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kolski </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is relying on the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> to keep <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s service going if its 10,000 mechanics go on strike and its 4,000 pilots refuse to cross the picket lines. But <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials were not as certain that all of <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s safety shortcomings are behind it. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> cited `` systemic difficulties'' with the airline's training program, record keeping and use of operational handbooks that are not yet corrected. And the agency disclosed it was seeking civil penalties against <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> for past violations, although no amounts were cited. `` Once the systemic problems have all been corrected, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> will turn its attention toward developing an appropriate enforcement package, including a proposed fine'' for past violations, <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s problems stem from safety violations found in early 1987 _ violations that attracted little public attention because <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s 55 jets were carrying only cargo Among the findings by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors were a shortage of required training records; inadequate auditing of maintenance facilites; poor documentation on the qualifications of `` check pilots'' who decide on the performance of line pilots; incomplete flight operations manuals, instances of pilots failing to go through required refresher training; and training programs that did not meet federal standards. In a related development Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> made public a report on improvements <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has made in its own maintenance program since the airline was fined a record $ 9.5 million two years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said that Eastern has made `` substantial progress'' to correct past deficiencies, but that some concerns remain about the airline's deferred maintenance program and repeated problems with certain equipment. Nevertheless, Eastern officials hailed the latest <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> findings which showed that corrective actions had been taken in 52 of the 53 areas cited by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. `` We are very pleased. This report shows that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has corrected the deficiencies,'' said <PERSON> Kolski </PERSON>.

 Prices closed higher in moderately light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. There was little fresh news to affect share prices, dealers said. Instead, sentiment turned moderately favorable following Tuesday's release of positive British economic data, they said.

 A federal judge approved a $ 25 million settlement Tuesday to end a class-action lawsuit brought by former owners of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> catalog stores. The settlement will affect 852 store owners, with the average payment totaling $ 24,000. The owners sued 2 -LCB- years ago to challenge <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s decision to stop taking catalog orders from independent store operators The agreement, reached last month shortly before the case reached a jury, also requires <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a retail chain based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and owned by <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to drop countersuits to recover nearly $ 2 million in debts from operators. `` The settlement is fair, reasonable and completely adequate considering the hazardous litigation,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said in approving the settlement Tuesday. `` It is clear to this court that a jury could have found in favor of the defendants.'' He also said only about 20 former owners objected to the settlement, and the objections centered on the distribution of the settlement, an issue to be handled later. The opposition included two former store owners who testified Tuesday. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Imerito </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Wysox </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Montrose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said they doubted their payments would cover their costs. Their attorney, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slap </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he will appeal. `` The assignment of the distribution could split the class into warring factions, and this kind of opposition reflects on the fairness of the settlement,'' he said. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney representing most of the plaintiffs' lawyers, asked the judge to set an immediate hearing on lawyer fees. He suggested a payment of $ 3.5 million plus $ 500,000 in expenses. The judge said he would decide the issue later, possibly after agreement is reached on dividing the $ 25 million.

<HEAD>Forecast: 1988 Construction Contracts To Drop 4 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: for release at 6:30 p.m. EST.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction contracts will drop 4 percent this year, led by steep declines in office and other commercial building and lesser drops in housing and public works projects, according to a forecast released Wednesday. Builders will commit to $ 246.2 billion worth of new contracts in all of 1988 compared with $ 255.2 billion last year, according to an update of the 1988 Dodge-Sweet's Construction Outlook, put out by <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In coming months, construction activity will only be slightly affected by the stock market crash of last October, the <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> unit said. `` Since October, consumer confidence has been shaken, federal budgetary restraint has been tightened and expectations for the economy's growth in 1988 have been lowered,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, chief economist at the company. `` At the same time, however, the outlook for interest rates has brightened.'' Accordingly, so long as a recession is avoided, this mix of positive and negative developments will not pose a serious threat to a credit-sensitive industry such as construction, he said. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> predicted nonresidential building would drop 7 percent, to $ 89.5 billion this year, led by the `` highly overbuilt office market.'' Office building activity should drop by 14 percent to $ 19.2 billion, and will have to fall even more `` if the office vacancy rate is to shrink from its current 20-plus percent,'' he added. Reduced consumer spending and weaker home-building together could mean a 12 percent drop in the retail sector, to $ 21.6 billion, while industrial building should pick up by 6 percent, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. While many would-be home buyers remain on the sidelines in the wake of the market crash, lower interest rates will lure others back into the market, he said. Even so, single family homebuilding will ease 1 percent, to $ 84.9 billion, and multifamily housing will slump 4 percent, to $ 26.3 billion, dragged down by a large surplus of apartments, he added. The report predicted nonbuilding construction would be pulled two ways in 1988, with environmental building increasing by 2 percent and transportation building down by 4 percent. As a result, total nonbuilding construction will shrink by 1 percent overall, to $ 45.1 billion, the forecast said.

 Construction of the tunnel under the English Channel is roughly on schedule and within budget, a co-chairman of the Anglo-French building consortium <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Alastair </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, acknowledged that certain aspects of the construction of the 31-mile rail tunnel under the English Channel have fallen behind schedule, but said none of the delays so far led him to believe the tunnel will not open in 1993 as planned. The start of tunneling on the French side was delayed when one suppliers for the boring machine went bankrupt and the machinery had to be finished in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but he said the machine is now in place and will resume boring shortly. Boring on the English side of the channel began as planned on Dec. 1 and is progressing on schedule, he said.

 The dollar finished lower against all major currencies Wednesday in dull, thin trading. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold of $ 446.25 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's late bid of $ 444.15. Traders said the dollar moved in a narrow, technical range. The currency jumped higher last week when the government a reported smaller-than-expected merchandise trade deficit for December, but traders said a lack of follow-through buying based on the trade number continued to push the dollar lower. `` In general, the market has lost its luster to buy the dollar in this environment,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Additionally, one large order to sell dollars took its toll on the currency, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar also fell in earlier European trading, when profit-taking pushed the currency down from its session highs. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar continued its decline against the Japanese yen, closing at 130.41 yen, down 0.09 yen from Tuesday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted lower at 130.30 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 130.125 yen, down from 130.385 yen on Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was quoted at $ 1.7490, compared with Tuesday's $ 1.7440. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.75415 for one British pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $ 1.74625 Other later dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.7010 West German marks, down from 1.71045; 1.3995 Swiss francs, down from 1.4040; 5.7395 French francs, down from 5.7805; 1,253.50 Italian lire, down from 1,258.00, and 1.2673 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2685.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Soar The Limit In Technical Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cotton futures prices soared the limit allowed for daily trading Wednesday in a technically inspired rally that lifted the market out of several weeks in the doldrums. On other markets, soybean futures surged while grains were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mixed; precious metals advanced slightly; energy futures were mostly lower; and stock-index futures retreated. Cotton prices for delivery in March, May and July all advanced the 2 cents a pound daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in buying that accelerated sharply when the May contract reached 63.20 cents a pound, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, cotton specialist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The rally marked the largest daily movement for those contracts _ all of which are based on the 1987 crop _ since Jan. 26, when the price on all three contracts fell nearly 2 cents a pound. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> attributed most of the buying to technical, rather than fundamental factors. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said rumors of Soviet purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cotton may also have contributed to the rally. `` That's it as far as fundamentals,'' she said. `` The market's just been quiet for a while and today it began to pick up. The contract for March delivery settled at 63.70 cents a pound. Soybean prices soared near the close on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as talk circulated that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> radio news commentator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> had reported the discovery of a `` sudden death syndrome'' affecting soybean crops, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst for G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office confirmed the commentator had reported such a finding, based on a wire service report about a research project at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> The Associated Press reported the story in 1986. The soybean complex also was supported by expectations of new foreign purchases of soybean meal and soybean oil, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The soybean rally spread to the neighboring grain pits, pushing corn prices higher and bringing wheat futures off their lows of the day, analysts said. Wheat settled unchanged to 32 cents lower with March at $ 3.27 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents to 4 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.01 -RCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at $ 1.91 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 11 \ cents to 13 \ cents higher with March at $ 6.33 -LCB- a Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after declining sharply earlier in the day in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly cattle-on-feed report. The report showed larger numbers of cattle being fattened for slaughter than the market had anticipated. That sent futures prices lower in early trading, but steady cash prices for livestock limited the losses, analysts said. Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .68 cent higher with February at 71.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .85 cent higher with March at 83.85 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at 47.17 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .28 cent lower with February at 55.70 cents a pound. Precious metals futures advanced slightly on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but analysts said the move did not indicate a change in the recent downward trend for gold and silver prices. `` The dollar appears to be holding steady, the balance of trade figure is showing improvement and that is leading to a rather weak investment demand outlook for gold,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, metals analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 1.40 to $ 1.80 higher with April at $ 449.20 a troy ounce; silver was 7.5 cents to 7.8 cents higher with March at $ 6.45 a troy ounce Energy futures finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after starting out higher in reaction to weekly <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> figures showing sharp drawdowns in gasoline and distillate stocks. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 4 cents higher with March at $ 16.61 a barrel; heating oil was .39 cent to .79 cent lower with March at 45.58 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .38 cent higher with March at 46.66 cents a gallon. Stock index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.25 points lower at 259.85. The underlying spot index was off .61 point at 259.21.

<TEXT>
 When foreign corporations and investors look at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> these days, they see a big `` For Sale'' sign. The weak dollar, relatively cheap <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock prices and fears of trade protectionism have escalated the already heady pace of foreign acquisitions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. While some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses and politicians are worried about the impact of the invasion, many corporations are jumping to hook up with cash-rich foreign suitors. `` We're finding there's a lot of interest out there,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a managing partner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with the British investment banker <ORGANIZATION> Samuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montagu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're working on a number of deals at the moment.'' At the same time, hostile foreign takeovers are expected to be a minority. Aside from several high-profile hostile battles already waged this year, foreign buyers mainly are expected to be business-oriented suitors interested in long-term benefits rather than quick profits. Recent weeks have witnessed a mini-wave of foreign buyouts. In one of the biggest, <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a joint venture by which <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> would acquire 75 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s global tire business, the world's fifth-largest, for $ 1 billion. A flurry of smaller deals also have surfaced, including: _ <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> for $ 750 million from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chartered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> _ British publisher <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 283 million purchase of the textbook publisher <ORGANIZATION> Addison-Wesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ The $ 36 million buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Anspach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grossman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portugal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a corporate image consultant, by <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British marketing firm that last year acquired advertising giant <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 566 Still being contested are two of the year's biggest proposals: <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile $ 4.2 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile $ 5.4 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The 1988 buying spree had been expected following the rise of foreign buyouts in recent years. Foreign buyers _ chiefly the British and Japanese _ spent an estimated $ 41.9 billion in acquiring 326 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisitions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, compared with $ 25.2 billion in 358 deals during 1986 and just $ 2.2 billion for 116 takeovers in 1983. British buyers alone accounted for about $ 30 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions last year, such as <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 7.8 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, while the Japanese took in about $ 6 billion worth of purchases, including <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s records business. The speedup in foreign buyouts coincided with the sharp decline in the dollar's value that has increased foreign buying power in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the past two years. The Japanese yen's value has risen by about 100 percent against the dollar since early 1985, and the British pound by 64 percent in that time. Furthermore, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock prices have rebounded somewhat from their lows following October's market crash, they generally remain well below their peaks of last summer, keeping the market prices of many American businesses at cut-rate levels. That presents a unique opportunity for foreign businesses to make long-desired strategic expansions into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, for example, would become a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitor for the first time through its Firestone venture. Such considerations also make it likely that hostile deals will be the exception rather than the rule. `` What the Japanese would like to establish over here is a significant presence, a more efficient operation,'' said <PERSON> Shuehei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant banking for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sanwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` In order to achieve that, it's necessary to have a good team of managers, a good working relationship with workers or labor unions.'' `` That could only be achieved, in the Japanese manager's mind at least, by having friendly negotiations,'' he said. But along with those welcoming new foreign investment are critics warning against a tidal wave of foreign ownership, ranging from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, the entrepreneurial chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Critics say foreign takeovers could cause the same problems they attribute to the domestic takeover wave of the 1980s, including lost jobs, a weakened industrial base and lost tax revenue. Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, who already has proposed legislation to restrict domestic hostile takeovers, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to examine the impact of foreign buyouts and the benefits that foreign corporations might enjoy in pursuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> and others have said the laws of some countries such as <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> gave foreigners legal veils of secrecy and other unfair advantages in their attempts to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. `` We're going to try to analyze what the threat is and what we might want to do in response to it,'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview.

 Australian investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> a </PERSON> <PERSON> Court </PERSON> said his conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> lost 500 million Australian dollars, or about $ 350 million, as a result of the October stock market crash. The loss announced Monday was the largest corporate loss in Australian history, according to newspapers. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court was considered the richest man in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> until the Oct. 19 world crash that started on Wall Street. The company's flagship firm, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said revaluing of investments caused the losses, which also were spread across <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court's <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> holdings. A <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the losses reflected a `` clearing of the decks'' and the adoption of one-time writedowns. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court has a 30 percent holding in <ORGANIZATION> Broken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Proprietary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s largest companies <ORGANIZATION> BHP </ORGANIZATION> shares dropped sharply during the stock collapse.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Largely Unchanged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices stagnated or fell marginally Wednesday in light trading, reflecting fresh uncertainty over the outlook for interest rates and the economy's direction. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year issue lost about $ 2 per $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and is considered a sign of interest rate trends, rose to 8.48 percent from 8.46 percent late Tuesday. Bond prices generally had been rising and interest rates falling this year up until last Friday, when economic statistics suggested the economy is n't slowing down significantly despite the stock market crash in October. Signs of a slowdown or impending recession often rally the bond market because they imply the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will ease credit conditions. But <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> obscured the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s intentions on Tuesday, when he said important features of the economy seem stable Bond prices fell as a result. On the other hand, fresh economic evidence reported Wednesday suggested recession remains a possibility. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said housing construction fell in January to the lowest level since the end of the last recession, and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production grew only marginally. `` I think the whole range of numbers have gone from imminent recession to that of a more balanced approach, so we do n't know where we're going,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Veronda </PERSON>, director of fixed-income investments at <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` It's really painted a mixed bag.'' In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities fell 1-32 point and long-term issues fell about 3-16 point, the financial information service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.09 to 113.05. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 0.40 to 1,182.63. In corporate transactions, industrials were largely unchanged and utilities fell -LRB- point in light trading. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.24 to 282.10. Among tax-exempt municipal bonds, general obligations fell about \ point and dollar bonds were unchanged, municipal traders said. Business was light. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were unchanged at 5.73 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills fell 4 points to 5.98 percent and year bills were unchanged at 6.29 percent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two former executives of <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutritional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were found guilty Wednesday of selling apple-flavored sugar water labeled as pure apple juice for babies, a prosecutor said. `` I think it's an important victory for consumers,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, executive assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the Eastern District of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who prosecuted the case. `` Our whole trial team believes that justice has been done,'' he said. The defendants _ former <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Neils </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> and a former vice president, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> _ faced hundreds of violations of federal food and drug laws, and conspiracy and mail fraud charges. <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> was convicted of all 448 counts in the indictment, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> was found guilty on 351 counts, all violations of federal food and drug law, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said. The jury could n't agree on the remaining counts regarding <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>, he said. The company, which also was named in the November 1986 indictments, pleaded guilty last year. The indictment charged that <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> shipped adulterated and misbranded juice made from phony concentrate throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas from 1978 to 1983. The juice, labeled as 100 percent apple juice for babies, was actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no apple juice, the prosecution charged. It was bottled at a <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Canajoharie </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. There has been no evidence that the juice caused any health problems, the prosecution said. `` This case was tried not in terms of being a health hazard,'' <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It was tried as a fraud case. It was our view that the evidence in this case demonstrated a massive defrauding of <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>'s consumers by <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> did not fix a specific date for sentencing, but it should be within six to eight weeks, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said both <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> `` face substantial prison terms and substantial fines.'' Conspiracy is punishable by five years in prison and @ or a $ 10,000 fine; mail fraud is punishable by five years and @ or $ 1,000; food and drug law violations are punishable by three years and @ or $ 10,000, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said. The two men were allowed to remain free on bail until sentencing, the prosecutor said. During closing arguments last Monday, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said that evidence presented at the three-month trial never showed <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> `` worrying about selling fake apple juice to babies,'' but they were instead concerned about `` bad publicity and profits.'' `` This is not the way we expect corporate executives in this country to operate,'' he said. <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, argued that the government had `` fallen short by an enormous margin'' of proving his client's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> charged that two key prosecution witnesses who work for <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> had lied when they testified that they had repeatedly warned executives that the concentrate was phony. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>'s attorney, said his client was `` a man who had nothing to gain by committing a crime.'' <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> was in charge of manufacturing at the <LOCATION> Canajoharie </LOCATION> plant. The jury began deliberations last Tuesday. It was not told that on Nov. 13, three days before the trial began, <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty to 215 counts of violating federal food and drug charges and agreed to pay a $ 2 million fine. In May Beech-Nut, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that is based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, settled a class action suit that was filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in response to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> indictment. In that case, <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> agreed to set up a $ 5 million cash fund for consumers and to provide $ 2.5 million in Beech-Nut and affiliated products to retailers. Also on the team prosecuting <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> were two attorneys from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Consumer Litigation: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleder </PERSON>, director of that office and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jost </PERSON>, a trial attorney.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fiscal 1989 budget cites `` few signs of serious damage'' to the economy from last year's stock market plunge in outlining programs to reduce the budget deficit to $ 129.5 billion, budget documents showed Wednesday <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spending outline _ to be formally submitted on Thursday _ will propose record spending of $ 1.09 trillion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, against $ 964.7 billion in receipts, according to a portion of the document obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the policies proposed in this budget are adhered to, the deficit will decline steadily in future years,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the budget report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The spending proposal, likely to produce the least contentious budget debate of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency because it adheres to a budget pact struck last year with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, proposes a $ 20.7 billion reduction from last year's spending shortfall of $ 150.2 billion. The Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law calls for a budget deficit of no more than $ 136 billion in fiscal 1989, which begins next Oct. 1. However, many private economists contend that the deficit will be higher next year, even with the steps expected to be outlined in the new budget _ including the smallest defense spending increase ever sought by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The new budget report concedes that the new <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spending plan `` assumes a declining rate of inflation and falling interest rates'' for both 1988 and 1989. The budget document calls last October's stock market collapse `` startling'' and cites `` many predictions that the economy would soon suffer a downturn or even a return of the Great Depression.'' `` Although it is too soon to determine what the final effects will be, the initial fears now seem greatly exaggerated,'' the budget report states. `` Despite the sharp reversal in stock prices, the economy has shown few signs of serious damage,'' it adds. The new <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget assumes that the economy will grow in 1988 by 2.4 percent and by 3.5 percent in 1989. However, the budget report states that a percentage point lower growth _ even with no change in other economic data _ could drive up the deficit by an additional $ 6.3 billion in 1988 and $ 18 billion in 1989. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s new budget document projects that the deficit in the current fiscal year, fiscal 1988, will total $ 146.7 billion _ with $ 1.055 trillion in spending and $ 909.2 billion in receipts. It projects that the deficit, after declining to $ 129.5 billion in 1989, will ease to $ 104.2 billion in 1990, to $ 79.3 billion in 1991 and to $ 51.1 billion in 1992. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget cited expected improvements in exports, leading to `` a welcome resurgence of the nation's industrial sector,'' as the main source of economic strength in the coming years. The eighth, and for practical purposes, final <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget takes note of the fact that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s initial budget plan, submitted in 1981, `` was expected to achieve a balanced budget by 1985.'' `` Instead, the budget has been in deficit. Reducing the deficit is one of the nation's central economic policy concerns.'' A key reason why the budget still is n't balanced, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s new budget report suggests, is the drain on the economy of the deep 1981-82 recession as well as the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has `` been unwilling to approve'' domestic spending cuts he proposed. Many of these proposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reductions were expected to be included in the $ 1.1 trillion fiscal blueprint being unveiled Thursday, including proposals for transferring government functions including parks management and perhaps <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> railroad service to private industry. But the plan also was being crafted to comply with the spending agreement reached last fall in the budget `` summit'' between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders. Since the budget summit agreement spells out overall spending and tax levels, including allocations for the military, domestic programs and foreign aid, this year's battles were expected to focus on the details rather than the thrust of the budget priorities. The pact should help smooth the budget's path through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, since the balance between domestic and military spending totals is annually one of the most difficult. In addition, Democratic leaders have pledged to speed the process and avoid packing all spending into a single, massive bill as they did in a $ 600 billion measure last year. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged in his State of the Union address never again to sign such legislation, `` he was preaching to a choir already converted,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said this week In addition to the requirements of the budget agreement, the administration is proposing about $ 14 billion in sales of government assets and `` privatization'' initiatives to drop the deficit to $ 129.5 billion. The fiscal 1987 deficit was $ 150.4 billion, and red ink this year is expected to drop to $ 146.7 billion, according to administration estimates. The administration's estimates, which are more optimistic than those of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, would normally provoke widespread charges of `` cooking the books'' for the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. However, the revised Gramm-Rudman law requires that administration estimates be used in determining whether the budget meets its goals. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday he was concerned about <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> using too rosy a set of figures But, he added, `` unduly pessimistic assumptions could produce unnecessary battles over additional spending cuts or tax increases that, in this election year, might achieve nothing.''

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> president ignored the issue of smoking and health until the 1964 Surgeon General's report, and asserted that smoking posed no hazard because it never harmed him, according to evidence released Wednesday <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said in testimony read for the jury that company officials `` did n't even discuss a position about smoking and health as far as the corporation was concerned.'' Previous testimony in the trial, in which <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> and two other cigarette makers are being sued over a smoker's lung-cancer death, revealed that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> had a 25-year research program, starting in 1954, to develop a less carcinogenic cigarette that was never marketed. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, under questioning by plaintiff's attorney <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, said the 1964 report `` was a concern to us as it was to other people in the industry.'' But <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said, `` I did n't think anything about smoking and health other than smoking was not harmful to you in any way.'' <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> asked the basis for that opinion, and <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> replied: `` It did n't ever harm me.'' <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> pressed him for the facts he considered, and <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said it was `` just my belief.'' Once the Surgeon General's report came out, <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said he did n't look further into the validity of its findings because `` it would n't do any good anyway.'' He said he read it as executive vice president, shortly before becoming president. <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> about the adequacy of federally mandated warnings on cigarette packs required in 1966. `` We did n't care to warn the public about anything. We just had to put that warning on. It was n't because we liked to. It was just something we had to do. We were n't interested in warning the public about something,'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, who has since died, was 76 when the testimony was taken by attorneys for <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who is suing <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for the death of his wife <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. It was read in court Wednesday by <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> and an actor playing the role of <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>. The executive was a former semi-professional baseball player who joined the company in 1934 and rose through the ranks until becoming president and chief operating officer in 1964. He retired in 1972. Responding to <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>'s statements, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilburg </PERSON> said the witness was `` nearly 80 years old when he gave that testimony.'' `` It was n't unusual for people's memories to fade over that period of time,'' <PERSON> Hilburg </PERSON> said. He said he did not know when <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> died. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> charges that the three tobacco companies, makers of the brands Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> smoked, neglected to do enough research on cigarettes, did n't reveal adequately what they did find and failed to put safer cigarettes on the market. One reason for not marketing the safer cigarette, <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> argues, was because to do so would weaken the companies' defense against lawsuits over their existing products. Referring to a 1968 memorandum from <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>'s researcher to <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> on a meeting of tobacco company scientific directors, <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> asked what <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> did with similar memos after reading them. `` I read that and probably referred it to our legal department,'' the former executive replied. `` Why?'' asked <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>. `` Because I thought they should know about it,'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> replied. `` Why?'' <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> pursued `` That was just our policy. They were the people that I was holding responsible.'' The purpose of the conference detailed in the memo was to `` discuss the scientific aspects of the problems facing the tobacco industry with specific emphasis on tobacco and health,'' the document said.

<HEAD>Allegis Says Court Grants Request For Stay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court has granted its request to order a halt to union plans to block the company's restructuring. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit in January in <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, contending that <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION>' plan to sell its non-airline subsidiaries and distribute the proceeds to shareholders was illegal. The union contended that the restructuring would create a higher debt load for <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION>' core business, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court held that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was an inappropriate place to resolve the question and ordered a stay of all proceedings. `` It was not the headquarters of the company or where any of the transactions took place,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobor </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION>. The Allegis statement said the court's ruling does not prevent the union from refiling the action `` in an appropriate forum.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hobor </PERSON> said she did not know if the union has any such plans. The union's headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was closed Wednesday night, and a spokesman there could not be reached for comment. The restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION>, which involves the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> rental car company and <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> hotel subsidiaries, will push its debt-to-equity ratio from about 55 percent to 80 percent, company spokesman <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonring </PERSON> said in January. He said then that the restructuring would mean selling off equity, but `` it's not that we're incurring new debt.'' The company promised its 58 million shareholders it would give them a $ 50 dividend to distribute proceeds from the sales or would buy the equivalent amount of shareholders' stock, which would have tax advantages. In January, <PERSON> Gonring </PERSON> said the lawsuit was filed in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> because that is where the largest proportion of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 21,000 employees in the machinists union are based
