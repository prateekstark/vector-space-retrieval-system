 Japanese lumber mills are paying three or four times <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices, and trees worth millions of dollars cut from national forests may be exported illegally each year at a cost of American jobs. Northwest timber exports in 1988 were at least 4.3 billion board-feet, up 20 percent from 1987. Most of that was legal _ cut from private and state lands or, under limited authorization, from national forests. But federal law requires that national forest timber be milled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Since it's illegal, nobody really knows how much is going off the docks. As a wild estimate, I would imagine that maybe 5 percent might be federal logs. You're talking about $ 115 million to $ 120 million in lost revenue,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisco </PERSON>, a forester for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> LaDoux </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, disputes that estimate. `` There are people that have made claims that some are being exported,'' he said. `` Our opinion is that, if it is occurring, it is a real small percentage. We do n't think it's a major problem.'' But three men are awaiting trial in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> on charges of diverting more than 500,000 board-feet of national forest timber for illegal export. And the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says it does n't know for sure how big the problem is; there are no full-time law enforcement agents assigned to illegal export `` We still do n't have the blessing of the powers-that-be to go ahead with it to any great extent,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, an investigator at the agency's office in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> generally sets the priorities. `` They control the purse strings,'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. `` During the summer months, drugs are our priority. Practically everyone is working on drugs, primarily marijuana growing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> uncertainty over exports comes amid timber shortages blamed for layoffs, sawmill closures and increased industry-conservationist rancor. `` People could get killed out there'' if more trees are n't made available, said a speaker at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The region may suffer shortages at sawmills, but not at the docks. Exports of raw logs from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries jumped from 3.7 billion board-feet in 1987 to 4.3 billion board-feet in 1988, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, D-Ore. A fourth of all trees cut in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were exported in 1988, at a cost of up to 30,530 mill jobs, he said Roughly a fifth of the timber from the 12 Western states is exported, the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says. The <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Sisco </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures used by the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> frequently under-report log exports, and he put the total at 5 billion board-feet. In <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> researchers found exports of 230 million board-feet two years ago, while the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported around 26 million board-feet, he said. Logs from federal lands are illegally included in the exports since they add up to `` a lot of money very quickly,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Marke </PERSON> with the logs sitting there, people do n't look. `` You're talking about a serious amount of money being lost, either to the government or money being drained from the timber industry,'' <PERSON> Marker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sisco </PERSON> said: `` It's such big money, that is why the big companies have essentially closed their mills and they're into log exports now _ the log exports bring so much more money than the lumber would bring.'' He said that the Japanese pay `` at least three and four times'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market price and that political pressure has blocked enforcement of the export ban on federal timber. Congressional pressure to enforce the ban `` is mounting,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., who wants the annually renewed ban made permanent `` The most important reason why <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not pressed on this is because, frankly, timber companies do not make one peep in support of proper enforcement of the export ban law. `` The same timber company that will argue about job losses because of environmental standards creates many, many times that job loss due to their exporting logs, which also happens to be a very profitable operation.'' A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report on job loss and law enforcement related to federal timber exports is due this month, and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee held hearings Nov. 7 on proposals by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., to let states prohibit export of state-owned logs and to make the federal ban permanent `` Public lands should contribute to addressing public needs,'' <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> testified, adding there is a `` real timber supply need in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> right now.'' `` Timber that is harvested from our federal and state lands can make an important contribution to meeting this need,'' he said. `` Limiting exports is one positive way to do this while protecting other non-timber resources and saving American jobs.'' <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> have introduced companion measures in the House. The state-timber bill would legitimize <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> laws requiring in-state processing of logs, said a Packwood aide, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. Meanwhile, in what prosecutors believe is the first trial of its kind, three <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> men are to go on trial Nov. 20 in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> on charges of conspiring to export unprocessed federal logs to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tortorelli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Britz </PERSON> of Orting were indicted on charges in the shipment of 558,515 board-feet of timber from national forest in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` There are only so many logs for our mills,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>. `` If they are exporting logs illegally does n't that take away from the capability of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> mills?''

 Were it not for one violent day in 1985, <PERSON> Evelina </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> would be like countless other black South African women: an illiterate maid in her 50s, raised in a isolated farming district, mother of 10. Today, she is the only woman on Death Row _ alone, confused and ill. Her prison cell in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> is the farthest she's ever been from home. `` She can not eat, she ca n't sleep,'' said her lawyer, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` It's a very dramatic thing to say, but I used to think to myself that she's just going to die of a broken heart.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> and 13 men were sentenced to death in May for the mob killing in November 1985 of a black policeman, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Paballelo </LOCATION>, the black section of the remote northwestern town of <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION>. Twenty-six people were tried for the killing, and four men were found to have physically contributed to the death of <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>, who was chased from his home, stoned, beaten and set afire. In addition to those four, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> and nine others were convicted of murder under the doctrine of `` common purpose,'' which holds them responsible because they were part of the crowd that sought to kill <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>'s death occurred at a time of nationwide black unrest. Hours before he was slain several thousand blacks gathered at a soccer field in <LOCATION> Paballelo </LOCATION> to protest rent increases and other grievances. After police dispersed the crowd with tear gas, about 300 people re-grouped around <LOCATION> Sethwala </LOCATION>'s home and threw stones to force him outside. Militant blacks have frequently attacked black policemen, accusing them of collaborating with the government and its apartheid policies. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> and her common-law husband, who also has been sentenced to death, were identified as having thrown stones at <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>'s house. According to the state's evidence, she allegedly yelled: `` The dog is in the house. Bring him out and burn him alive.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> testified during the trial that she and her husband went back to their own house after the protest meeting was broken up and were not present at <LOCATION> Sethwala </LOCATION>'s home. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON>, who had no previous criminal record and worked for the same white family for 30 years, has little understanding of what is happening to her, Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> suffers from arthritis, heart disease and has high blood pressure, the lawyer said. She does not know in what city her prison is and thinks she's been imprisoned for at least a year, when in fact it has been six months. She sees her husband for 30 minutes, once a month. They are separated by a window and communicate through microphones. Only three of her 10 children have been able to visit her, Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> said. Because she can not read and is too ill to exercise, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> does little but listen to government-run radio that is piped into her cell, said Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON>, who visits her every three weeks. She has been treated well by the prison staff and has developed a good relationship with one of the guards, Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> added. A judge ruled in September that the 14 people sentenced to death could appeal their sentences, but a bail request for Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> was turned down. Two psychologists testified at her bail application that she had suffered mental and physical deterioration, including memory loss, since her imprisonment. Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> said no date has been set for the appeal, but she hopes it could be early next year. In a similar mob killing, the Appeal Court, the country's highest court, last year upheld under the `` common purpose'' doctrine the death sentence of six blacks known as the `` Sharpeville Six. However, after a storm of domestic and international protest, then-President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> commuted their death sentences to lengthy prison terms. The last woman to be executed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 25, who was of mixed race. She was hanged in June after being convicted of joining her boyfriend in the brutal knife murder of a teen-ager. More than 50 people, mostly black, have been executed so far this year, and more than 100 were hanged in each of the previous three years. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and his successor, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, have commuted 54 death sentences this year.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A massive offensive left no doubt about the Salvadoran guerrillas' military capacity and drove home their point that serious negotiations and government concessions are necessary to end the 10-year-old civil war. And the killings of six Jesuit priests during the offensive galvanized opposition in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continued aid for the rightist Salvadoran administration, which must be considered plus for the leftist rebels. But the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> paid a high price for its achievements. They turned densely populated urban districts into battlefields, and the lives of tens of thousands of workers became a weeklong nightmare of death and destruction. Residents of <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION>, Zacamil, <PERSON> Mejicanos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ciudad </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>, the humble neighborhoods devastated by the fighting that began Nov. 11, were angry at a government that sent warplanes to strafe and bomb guerrilla positions amid their homes. But those same residents seem to have saved most of their resentment for the rebels. `` We just want ` the boys' to leave, so we can go back to work and finish raising our children,'' said <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> as he fled with his wife and two daughters from <PERSON> Zacamil </PERSON>. The guerrillas maintained fortified positions in and around a complex of low-income apartment blocks there for four days. Virtually the entire non-combatant population evacuated under fire. When it appeared most of the civilians had left, government forces subjected <PERSON> Zacamil </PERSON> to a six-hour barrage of bazookas, rockets and cannon fire that left the complex smoldering and practically ruined. `` I know women whose sons are with the guerrillas, and I see how they worry about their children and suffer when they are killed. They're human too. But because of them, we almost get killed. If they would not have come, this would not have happened,'' said <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, sweeping her arm across her humble cinderblock <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION> home hit by bullets and shrapnel. It is difficult to imagine that the rebels made many converts in neighborhoods where the fighting was heaviest, but guerrilla chief <PERSON> Facundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardado </PERSON>, interviewed at his command post near Mejicanos, said the display of strength, organization and morale was motivating adolescent men and women to `` incorporate themselves'' into the struggle. `` I hold the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> in high regard professionally,'' retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week. The war `` can not be resolved militarily,'' said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, who drew up a strategic plan for the war in 1981 and was head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until the end of September. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the guerrillas can not be overcome until the roots of war _ unfair distribution of wealth and pervasive social injustice _ are addressed. In what appears to have been a response to the insurgent push, a squad of assassins murdered and mutilated six Jesuit priests and educators considered leftist ideologues by the country's rabid right. Two witnesses, who for the moment remain in hiding, reportedly saw men in army uniform commit the massacre. `` The time has arrived for President -LRB- <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to make good on his promise to control those officials in his government and in his party who in a good measure are responsible for the civil war,'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., said after the slayings `` In a time of reduced foreign aid, we must ask ourselves what it is we are achieving with the dollars we send,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not `` undermine a fragile democracy'' by withdrawing aid, and on Monday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted narrowly against restricting military aid. But the debate was bitter and at times personal, and the issue had clearly become controversial again. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided more than $ 3.5 billion in economic and military aid to a succession of Salvadoran governments this decade. It is generally conceded, even by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, that the rebels would have won the war by 1985 had it not been for massive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance. The guerrillas said this year they are willing to abandon armed struggle and convert the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> into a political party in exchange for sweeping political, economic and social reform. Rebel and government representatives sat down together in September and October to try to find a way toward peace. The government rejected the possibility of fundamental overhaul of the reigning system and limited its negotiating position to a demand that that the rebels lay down their arms and join `` the democratic process.'' When a bomb killed 10 unionists at a leftist labor federation, the rebels broke off talks. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> late last week issued a call for truce and an exhortation to both sides to resume peace talks. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said both sides have agreed in principle to heed the Pope's call and to accept the church as mediator. `` But the means of working this out are complicated and causing us a lot of work,'' <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said Sunday. The rebel offensive against the capital appeared all but over by early this week. It did not bring down the <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government, but left it shaken. With the capital and several provincial cites besieged and paralyzed and a protracted standoff apparently the best the armed forces could manage, leaders of the country's business and industrial sectors reportedly talked with military and political elements about replacing the government with a provisional regime. Diplomats said discussion of such a change, whether peacefully or by a coup, was preliminary, a kind of worst-case contingency. But that it was talked about at all is another indication the guerrillas delivered a telling blow.

<TEXT>
 A night's stay costs $ 160 if you use the hot tub, and summer reservations must be made months in advance, but once you're at <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighthouse </ORGANIZATION>, the price and the wait seem a bargain. The privacy of the island lighthouse, its 360-degree view of <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and the peaceful symphony of waves and sea birds are enough to warm even the coldest of hearts. Since it was completed in 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighthouse </ORGANIZATION> _ really a house although it does have a navigation light for sailors _ has been the site of 14 weddings, dozens of honeymoons and `` bunches of affairs,'' says owner <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> built it because he loves lighthouses and could n't figure what else to do with <LOCATION> Rockwell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a three-quarter-acre clump of rock, spruce and driftwood less than a mile from <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION>'s waterfront. He bought the island on speculation in 1973 for $ 3,000, then a decade later was unable to sell it at a profit. `` Thank God we did n't, because this has turned out better than any business venture,'' he said. <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, the town veterinarian and an occasional carpenter, began building the four-story, wood-frame structure in 1983. An architect provided a scale drawing in exchange for <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> spaying his dog. Except for some help with the framing, <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> did all the construction himself. The project raised some eyebrows in this scenic <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> fishing port and mill town about 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. `` There were three people who through the grapevine told me that it was a potential eyesore because it was visible from all over town,'' <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> recalled. `` And now it's the most photographed home in <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION>.'' In spite of virtually no advertising, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighthouse </ORGANIZATION> also has become the most hard-to-get overnight lodging in the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. It's open year-round, but summer reservations are recommended four to five months in advance. Most of next August already is booked. Although the lighthouse was built primarily as a romantic getaway, its little red beacon does aid mariners entering the island-studded sound. The Coast Guard even commissioned the building in July 1985, making it sort of an honorary lighthouse. The white-and-red lighthouse is a cozy escape from <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION>'s weather, which usually is wet and cool even in summer The interior walls are covered with cedar, black walnut, hemlock, fir. The spiral lattice staircase is handmade of Philippine mahogany. `` It's a cut above rustic,'' <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> said modestly. There are all the amenities of home except a television. Do n't even think of asking <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> if you can bring one `` I say if you want to watch television, why even go out there? The background music with the stereo system is an imperative to me, but the visual? You're inundated with the visual everywhere you look,'' <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> said. The entire lighthouse rents for $ 125 per night for up to five people. The hot tub is an extra $ 35. Above the round living room is the tower with three small bedrooms, including an intimate cupola room with 10 picture windows affording the 360-degree view. The lighthouse boosted <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>'s reputation for being somewhat eccentric, a description he savors. `` For sure,'' he said. `` Eccentric _ away from the center. But that's not by design. That's just who I am.'' The success of his island retreat has exceeded even <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>'s expectations `` It is a romantic place,'' he said. `` It is private, it is beautiful. At the risk of paraphrasing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON>, it fills up your senses.'' In the living room is a collection of guest books, filled with the remembrances of hundreds of visitors. They tell of sunny views of volcanic <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Edgecumbe </LOCATION>, of nights spent weathering violent winter storms. Gushing newlyweds declare their love with words and little hearts. Would-be poets try their hand at verse. `` We can not tell you how much we enjoyed our stay _ the fog, the beautiful views, the eagle-watching,'' a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> couple wrote. `` When we're back home in the terrible heat, we'll think of July in <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> with the fireplace roaring.''

<TEXT>
 Palestinian youths, unseen behind a row of tin-roofed shanties, showered a squad of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers with stones and taunted them with curses. The Israelis, encumbered with automatic rifles, riot helmets and tear gas canisters, lumbered around a corner in pursuit, but the teen-agers had vanished. Musing about the elusiveness of the Palestinians, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> chose a quotation from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Macbeth'': `` The earth has bubbles ... whither are they vanished?'' The soldiers' frustration at such encounters became quickly apparent as Gross, the army's chief education officer, gathered a dozen troops under a tree to talk about army orders limiting the use of force in battling the Palestinian uprising. `` I think our hands are tied. You can not do anything. You do n't fire because you're not allowed to,'' said Pvt <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, 21, cradling his riot helmet as he leaned on his Galil rifle. Defending the orders not to fire on stone throwers unless their lives were in danger, Gross asked, `` So, what's wrong with that?'' `` You do n't capture anyone. All day long you go around and around and you do n't catch anyone,'' said <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, whose full name could not be used in keeping with army regulations. As he spoke, stones smacked into the dirt near the gathering, first singly, then in flurries. Two soldiers stepped out of the semicircle and gave chase. They returned empty-handed. All the while there was whistling, which is used by Palestinian lookouts to signal that soldiers were in the camp. Gross asked if the soldiers believed they should be given more freedom to respond and what the consequences might be? A soldier wearing sunglasses argued that troublemakers _ `` those who deserve it'' _ should be punished, even beaten. `` I'm not saying shoot to kill but make it seriously painful for them and not give them two slaps on the face,'' he said. The army recently allowed soldiers to open fire with live ammunition against masked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists who refused orders to halt. But most stone-throwers do n't wear masks. Other soldiers protested that tougher action would only increase the hostility of the population, escalate violence and undermine the morality of the army. `` They are limitations -LRB- on the use of force -RRB- because that's how we were educated. We were not educated to kill, especially women and children,'' said one soldier. `` We are a moral army.'' In the course of the two-year uprising, 615 Palestinians have been killed in encounters with Israelis, and 42 Israelis have been slain by Palestinians. Thousands on both sides have been wounded. Gross said pent-up desires for revenge were natural. `` It's not a shame to be angry and feel a tremendous urge to beat someone. But it's important to control yourself,'' he said. No matter what political solution emerged, <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said, Israelis and Palestinians would have to live together. `` We have to try to avoid the expansion of circles of hate,'' he said. During the uprising, 530 officers and soldiers out of nearly 100,000 who have served in the occupied lands have been disciplined for overstepping the often-ambiguous limits on the use of force, army officials say. Punishment, criticized by liberals for being inadequate, has ranged from loss of pay, vacation or rank to a maximum jail term of two years. A captain, speaking at a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> military base, unbuttoned his shirt pocket to reveal a wad of written orders. One booklet stresses soldiers have `` no right to use force in order to punish'' and that army units should not humiliate the Arab population or damage property. The captain, also named <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, conceded some violations go unreported because officers are reluctant to undermine morale by reporting the misdeeds of their soldiers. `` Basically, we rely on the humanity of the soldiers and the commanders,'' he said. During the three-hour patrol in the Beach Camp, where 41,000 Palestinian refugees live along the sandy <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> shoreline, soldiers walked dirt streets alongside open sewers and squeezed down passageways so narrow they could n't carry their rifles sideways. The patrol first encountered hostile looks, then stones and curses. The soldiers aimed their rifles threateningly but did not fire. Before the patrol began, there were no signs of unrest and the open-air market was jammed with shoppers. `` The calm appears real, but in fact -LRB- the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> -RRB- had created a private army inside, with masked people walking around in the daylight. They started to run the daily life and soon they would have appeared with weapons,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Bouzi </PERSON>, a unit commander interviewed in a tent encampment nearby. He said his soldiers had wounded 30 Palestinians with plastic bullets in efforts to establish order during the unit's first week in Beach Camp. He also criticized a previous unit that refrained from entering the camp because of the outward calm. `` With all due respect to the quiet, if you do n't get in once or twice a day and show them that we can go there whenever we want, they will take the initiative.''

<HEAD>Bocuse, Robuchon and Girardet Named ``Chefs of Century.''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Superstar French chefs <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Robuchon </PERSON>, and the Swiss <PERSON> Fredy </PERSON> <PERSON> Girardet </PERSON> have been named `` chefs of the century'' by the Gault-Millau guidebook. The honor also was a return to grace for <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> because the quide gave him back his fourth toque or chef's hat. The toque is <PERSON> Gault-Millau </PERSON>'s symbol for excellence and <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> was demoted to three toques by last year's guide. According to the guidebook's president and editor, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Millau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON>'s problem last year was turning out the same basic menu for years, while other chefs were getting ahead with new ideas. Known as the `` emperor of cuisine,'' <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> also was criticized for traveling around the world rather than tending to his stock pots at his restaurant near <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Millau </PERSON> of always bringing his dog to the restaurant and not asking for the bill. But the spat simmered down as <LOCATION> Millau </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> kissed and made up. `` I was very happy to be named a chef of the century, and we've settled our differences,'' said <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> `` But the century is n't over yet,'' he added `` I think there's room for more of us up there.'' He said he was flattered to be in the company of two legendary chefs who were posthumously named `` chefs of the century:'' <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Escoffier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> Point </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Escoffier </PERSON> was the master of us all,'' said <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON>. `` And Point was the first chef-owner, who ran his own show. Before that chefs were hidden away, as restaurants were owned by maitre d's or entrepreneurs.'' `` <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> deserves his place at the top,'' said <PERSON> Millau </PERSON>, who said his guidebook was celebrating its 20th anniversary. `` He is an exceptional personality who has done more than anybody else to promote French cuisine abroad.'' `` But I consider <PERSON> Robochon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Girardet </PERSON> more creative and visionary chefs,'' added <LOCATION> Millau </LOCATION>. `` Especially <PERSON> Robuchon </PERSON>, who has known how to marry traditional cuisine with new tastes.'' <PERSON> Robuchon </PERSON> made quite a name for himself by bringing back the mashed potato as a gourmet favorite _ on menus with other specialties like sweet-sour `` migononettes'' of venison and hot foie gras with cream of lentils. All three `` chefs of the century'' are regularly awarded the top three stars in the <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION>, considered the bible of guidebooks. <PERSON> Gault-Millau </PERSON>, nearly as well-known in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION>, has a circulation of about 200,000 versus 720,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION>, the venerable guidebook that was first published in 1900. <PERSON> Gault-Millau </PERSON> is avidly read for its picturesque and peppery commentaries, a different style from the <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION>, whose terse listing is a very serious reference for gastronomes in a country that takes its gastronomy seriously. At least 1,200 French chefs and 15,000 guests packed an exhibition hall last week at the futuristic <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Defense </LOCATION> area west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the Gault-Millau awards followed by a tasting of regional food and wines. `` I have special prizes for our top chefs,'' announced <LOCATION> Millau </LOCATION>, `` provided they promise not to eat them.'' He presented each with a live Bresse rooster, a symbol of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> raised in the region known for producing its most succulent poultry. <PERSON> Bocuse </PERSON> looked his fowl right in the eye, claiming to hypnotize it. In the highest category of four toques and a grade of 19.5 out of 20 <ORGANIZATION> Gault-Millau </ORGANIZATION> listed 13 restaurants for 1990, adding three new establishments: the Auberge de l'Eridon at <LOCATION> Annecy </LOCATION>, the Auberge de l'Ill, at <LOCATION> Illhaeusern </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alsace </LOCATION> and the Cote d'Or at <LOCATION> Saulieu </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Burgundy </LOCATION> country. No restaurants fell from the four-toque category this year, but three famous gourmet meccas were demoted from three toques to two: Le Grand Vefour, <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Maree </PERSON>, all in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>WELDON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Turkeys are topical right now, but farmers say <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s growing preoccupation with health has turned the birds into a year-round money-maker. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Twist </PERSON>, who has 8,000 Toms fattening up for market, says he's learned turkeys are quite a bit smarter than most people think. `` They're very sociable ... docile and interested when people come in here,'' said Twist. `` The old wives' tales we heard were n't true _ they're intelligent and we enjoy them. So do consumers. Per capita consumption of turkeys has risen from 8.5 pounds in 1975 to 17 pounds a year in 1989. `` People are seeing turkey as a healthy, economical alternative to red meat,'' said <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turkey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` There also are a lot more products available, and that's what people want _ variety and convenience.'' Whole turkeys still are popular for holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, but the real growth in the <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> industry has been with products like <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> ham, hot dogs, sausage, bacon and fresh breast cutlets. Farmers raised 164 million turkeys in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1982, and the flock increased to 255 million birds this year. Twist, whose turkeys end up in hospital meals and fast-food turkey sandwiches, expects to raise about 80,000 of the birds this year. The Twist family has been farming in <LOCATION> DeWitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> since 1852. Chickens were added to the grain farm in 1969 and commercial egg production began in 1973. Twist said turkeys seemed a perfect way to balance the fluctuations in egg and grain markets. `` It's one area of our business where we do n't have to listen to the noon news to see if we're profitable,'' said Twist, who raises the turkeys for <ORGANIZATION> Trevcam </ORGANIZATION>, a company based in <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION>. Young turkeys hatched by the company are shipped to Twist's starter building, where they are fed and kept warm for eight weeks They then move to the two 50 - by 480-foot finishing buildings, where they eat a corn-soybean mixture, reaching market weight of about 27 pounds in a total of 18 weeks They are slaughtered and processed in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Twist said he is paid 9 cents a pound for the finished birds, and it costs about 3 cents to raise them.

 <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> will get another chance in January to plead his case to head the government's nuclear weapons production program, following the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's failure to win quick <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it would not act on the nomination before the holiday recess, which is expected to start before Thanksgiving. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the committee chairman, said more time was needed to analyze newly received documentation on Stello, who appeared before the panel last Wednesday <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said further hearings on Stello would be held after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns Jan. 22. `` We have an incomplete record now,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> did not return a reporter's telephone call Monday after <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s announcement. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, in an unusual personal appeal to the committee at Stello's confirmation hearing last week, said he urgently needed a confirmed chief of nuclear weapons production to carry out needed reforms. In a statement issued on Monday, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s nomination was `` one of my top priorities'' and said he expected him to be confirmed when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes `` I am certain that additional hearings will prove that the accusations raised in the waning hours of this session are those same accusations investigated years ago and resolved,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. There was no indication Monday whether the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would install Stello in the job temporarily for one year by making an appointment while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in recess. <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said last week he told <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> he would prefer not to accept a temporary appointment. Stello's opponents, led by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sens </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, believe <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> is not sufficiently committed to nuclear safety. Stello strongly denied this and vowed to carry out <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' orders to improve management of the nuclear weapons complex. Some committee Republicans, including Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, have accused Democrats of politically motivated delay tactics in order to kill the nomination. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the panel, said Monday the decision to hold further hearings was a `` fallback procedure.'' This should not be interpreted `` as a weakness in support ... in this nominee's chances of winning confirmation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said, adding he did not expect the January hearings to `` produce anything new that we have n't heard'' about Stello. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group that has spearheaded a campaign to defeat the nomination, praised the committee's decision to postpone a vote. `` We managed to beat back enormous White House pressure'' to quickly confirm Stello, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> legislative coordinator. `` It's the right move by the committee.'' Stello technically is still employed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, where he holds the title of executive director of operations. But he has been working full-time for <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> since July as an adviser on preparations for the restart of the department's idled <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear reactors.

 Soprano <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Welting </PERSON>, not heard at the Metropolitan Opera since its 1981 -'82 season, returned to sing a part she sang that season, <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON>, the mechanical doll in Offenbach's `` The Tales of <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> She was a delight, singing the coloratura lightly, beautifully and acting amusingly, charmingly. Miss Welting's doll does n't stay in the same mood throughout Act 1. She gets increasingly aggressive, flailing her arms at people, swinging <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> too fast in the dance, then clasping her hands around his neck to swing him, in a veritable stranglehold. Sometimes, the Met casts the same soprano in all of <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>'s tales The most recent was Dame <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. On Monday night, in the opera's first presentation this season, three women sang the parts. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lima </PERSON> was singing <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> for the first time at the Met. <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>'s voice should be produced fully, with strong tone and resonance. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> did that, but in Act 1 he sometimes seemed to be trying to make up for difficult high notes by increasing volume. In Act 2, he sounded vocally strained and tired, but he did n't sound tired anymore in Act 3. Altogether, it was a good job. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Montague </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, who made her Met debut in 1987, was splendid as <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>'s friend Nicklausse. In men's clothes, she still looked feminine, but that did n't matter. Her singing was clear, flexible and appealing. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> sang all four villains. He sang well but chose a path of subtlety which meant the audience missed the malevolence which makes the opera chilling. This especially was evident in his aria in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, presented by the Met _ but not everywhere _ as Act 2. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Forst </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, sang <PERSON> Giulietta </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> courtesan. She sang well but did n't sound seductive. The third act's <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON>, originally announced to be <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Blegen </PERSON>, was sung by <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Her voice is lovely, but she did n't build the drama of this most dramatic of the tales. Both Miss <PERSON> Forst </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> sounded more like singers being serious than like the characters they portrayed. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaasch </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, made his Met debut as the physicist in Act 1. He sounds like a tenor of much promise and, despite his white <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> wig, capered with unusually youthful agility, adding to the act's merriment. <PERSON> Sylvain </PERSON> <PERSON> Cambreling </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amiens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, conducted, and the orchestra sounded marvelous. This production was new in 1982. Act 1 is in a big room with a magical back wall of perpetual motion machines, but Acts 2 and 3 are gloomy. Act 3 is even darker than at first. No longer can the picture of <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON>'s mother be seen to become a real person who sings. Now it becomes darker and singing comes from that direction.

<HEAD>Chemical Industry Group Says Fungicides Help Keep Prices Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A ban on the use of crop fungicides would cause consumer food prices to rise by 13 percent and the supply of fruits, vegetables and peanuts to decline by 24 percent, a farm chemical trade association says. No total ban on fungicides has been proposed, and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said none is in the works. But <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vroom </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he wanted to call attention to the `` enormous benefit and the very small risk'' that result from the use of fungicides and other high-tech farming methods on food supplies. `` In my view, the debate regarding the safety of our food is almost totally risk-dominated,'' <PERSON> Vroom </PERSON> said. `` There is precious little mentioned about the benefit side of the equation.'' An economic study showing the effects of a ban on fungicides _ chemicals applied to crops, particularly fruit and vegetable, to prevent plant diseases _ was released by the association at a news conference Monday. The study, paid for by the association, was done by <ORGANIZATION> GRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, consulting subsidiary of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Knowlton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman on pesticides, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON>, commented, `` We have always been concerned about fungicides, but we're not going to cancel all of them.'' He noted federal law requires the agency to balance benefits against risks when judging any pesticides and said the agency adheres to that mandate. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanchuk </PERSON>, senior vice president and director of economics for the consulting firm, said, `` If fungicides were eliminated, you the consumer would pay more for lower-quality produce. You would find that many fruits and vegetables no longer look or taste the same as before, and they would cost much more.'' For example, he said, crops hit hardest with price increases would include popular salad bar items such as carrots, which would rise 80 percent; lettuce, 40 percent; tomatoes, 40 percent; and onions, 34 percent. Prices of other major crops also would go up sharply, he said. Peanuts and peanut butter would rise 68 percent; peaches, 37 percent; and potatoes, 37 percent. `` Some foods may not be available at all,'' <PERSON> Urbanchuk </PERSON> said. `` If fungicides were no longer used by American farmers, consumers would not have bananas to slice on their morning meal, and children may not have peanut butter for their lunch sandwiches.'' Production of fruits would decline by 32 percent, vegetables by 21 percent, peanuts by 68 percent, and the major grains such as corn and wheat by 6 percent, he said. <PERSON> Urbanchuk </PERSON> said in his statement that poorer families would suffer the most by not being able to afford higher prices for fruits and vegetables. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefferts </PERSON> of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said she had not studied the chemical industry's report and had no comment on the study's specific figures. But, she said, the current way of growing food with large amounts of fungicides and other chemicals `` is n't the only way to do it.'' In fact, she added, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> recently reported on alternate ways of farming to reduce the contamination of soil, water and air by cutting back on chemicals. `` We're confident, and so is the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, that we can produce foods profitably and competitively using far fewer fungicides and other pesticides,'' <PERSON> Lefferts </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The most telling statistic would be not how much reduced fungicide use would cost consumers, but how much it would cost the chemical industry,'' she said. Fungicides represent about $ 370 million or 7.4 percent of the $ 5 billion-a-year farm chemicals industry, association officials said. An advisory board for the study included representatives of the association, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fertilizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, Resources for the Future and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>, turned away by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a top environmental job in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw his nomination.

 Catfish farmers have boosted production sharply from a year ago, and their prices have dropped almost as much. Production in October was estimated at 31.7 million pounds, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. That was up 21 percent from 26.2 million pounds a year earlier. Prices received by growers averaged 64 cents per pound. That was down 19 percent from 79 cents in October 1988.

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> is getting the last word _ or at least the latest _ in his little tiff with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over which one of them did more damage to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. In a review of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s book, `` My Turn,'' the former White House chief of staff says his former boss' wife `` seems incapable of understanding how her words and deeds might seem selfish, hypocritical and, indeed, even frightening to those on the outside.'' `` Very sadly ... this book gives aid and comfort to those who still believe that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never should have been elected president in the first place,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. His review, in the December issue of Washingtonian magazine, also replied to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s criticism of his disclosure in his memoirs that she had come to rely on the advice of an astrologer for scheduling <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s activities. Wrote she: `` It never, ever, occurred to me that <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> would do what he did _ that he would take this information about my interest in astrology and twist it to seek his revenge on <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> on me.'' Wrote he, in his review: `` Frankly, I hesitated before putting this astounding fact into the historical record. I certainly did not ` take this information ... and twist it to seek ... revenge.' `` The fact is, I wrote about astrology because it was an essential truth about the way the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> operated. My description of White House life in my period as chief of staff would have made little sense if I had omitted it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> minimized her dependence on astrology _ saying she called the astrologer only once or twice a month _ but <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said astrology played a significant role in shaping the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. `` It was a daily, sometimes hourly, factor in every decision affecting the president's schedule,'' he wrote. `` He _ or in this case she _ who controls the president's schedule controls the workings of the presidency.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wrote that she urged her husband to fire <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> after `` a stream of high government officials and congressional leaders'' came to her with the same message: <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> had poor relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the press, was restricting access to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, was intimidating subordinates. Anyway, she said, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> deserved to be fired because the Iran-Contra affair occurred `` on his watch.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, for his part, said, `` It apparently never registers with the former first lady that ... she damages her husband and his presidency'' in the way her book acidly criticizes many of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s closest advisers, including <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. `` After all,'' he wrote, `` these were <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s choices, made after close consultation with his financial and political supporters and friends in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; he must have thought that they met his own standards.'' His conclusion: `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> both have written for the historical record. Others will no doubt do the same; and to that end, history, that greatest of all polygraphs, will makes its judgment. I am comfortable with that.''

 Congressional negotiators reached agreement on a $ 14.8 billion deficit-reduction package for this year early Tuesday and leaders of both parties predicted the measure would be quickly approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The deal would bring to a close a partisan budget standoff that has lasted most of the year. `` It will pass overwhelmingly, I think, in both bodies, because it's a pretty good'' package, said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` It is a very strong, effective deficit reduction package,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told his colleagues. Leaders scheduled votes on the agreement in both chambers on Tuesday. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said he had been told by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> `` the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will support this package.'' The package includes about $ 5.7 billion in new tax revenues, as well as a collection of spending reductions and accounting changes that result in lowered spending this year. It also claims $ 4.6 billion in savings by leaving cuts in federal programs imposed by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law in effect through the first week of February. Those cuts were triggered on Oct. 1 when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and lawmakers failed to reach a budget-cutting deal. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders from both parties held meeting after meeting through the day on the two biggest unfinished pieces of the puzzle _ deficit reduction bill and a repeal or scale-back of Medicare catastrophic health insurance. The health plan, designed to prevent retirees from being financially ruined by major illness, was passed last year with strong bipartisan support and was considered one of the last major achievements of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was forced to rethink the legislation this year because of a storm of protest from the wealthy elderly, who would be taxed up to $ 800 a year to cover their new benefits. The House on Sunday, on a 349-57 vote, reaffirmed its position that the entire law should be scrapped, surtax and benefits together. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, however, favors a plan to scale back the benefits enough to drop the surtax in exchange for a small annual premium. The two chambers resumed negotiations Monday in hopes of a compromise. Another `` must-pass'' piece of legislation was a collection of about $ 5.3 billion in new taxes, a bunch of accounting changes, and some across-the-board spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants at least $ 14 billion in deficit reduction for the current fiscal year. Three-way talks involving the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were negotiating that deal, which covers a broad range of issues including a new system for paying doctors for services to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients. In the long run, said Sens. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., two of the sponsors, the change will hold down medical costs and help assure that high-qualify medical services are available to rural areas and The plan establishes a national fee schedule based on costs of providing services. Physicians now are reimbursed on the basis of historical fees that often have little relationship to costs of providing care. The government's costs for physician fees have been increasing at about 15 percent per year, and in the last fiscal year totalled $ 24.5 billion. The new fees would be based on the skill, training and time required to perform the service. The fee structure would be aimed at bringing down high fees for certain services such as surgery relative to fees for treatment provided by family practitioners and internists, who may perform fewer `` procedures'' but whose treatment, even if only counseling, may require equally high skill and knowledge. Adding to the incentive for approving the deficit bill was, indirectly, the pay raise that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided last week to give itself. The pay raise package includes initial `` cost-of-living adjustments'' of 7.9 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and nearly 10 percent for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But those raises wo n't happen until the budget bill is enacted. Enactment would cancel spending cuts ordered Oct. 1 under the Gramm-Rudman law because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president failed to meet their deficit-reduction goals. On the spending front, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday vetoed his second appropriations bill in two days because he objected to abortion provisions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday vetoed a $ 14.6 billion foreign aid bill because it contained $ 15 million for a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> population control agency that operates worldwide, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a one-child-per-family policy that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said results in coerced abortions, and he said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency would make the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a party to that practice. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which does not have a two-thirds majority to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on abortion questions, approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Monday a bill without the money for the population control agency, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> followed suit later in the day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday vetoed the annual District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> appropriations bill. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> barred the city from using federal money for abortions, it had taken out out a similar restriction on the city's use of its own local tax dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> immediately took up and passed by voice vote a new version designed to meet the president's objections, sending the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which also passed the clean version of the bill just before midnight. The House by voice vote on Monday sent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a third spending bill, vetoed earlier in an abortion dispute, in a form more to his liking. The $ 156.7 billion appropriation for the <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and other agencies, was vetoed earlier because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to allow federal money to pay for abortions for poor women who were victims of rape and incest. At <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s insistence, the new bill would cover abortions cases only when the life of the mother was in danger Although its adjournment target dates are typically in early October, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> typically works until nearly Christmas in non-election years. The last time it adjourned before December in an odd-numbered year was in 1983, when lawmakers went home on Nov. 18.

A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking Monday on condition of anonymity, said, `` It's the White House that's been yelling ` parity, parity, parity''' to make sure that top officials in all three government branches were covered when they left government. `` That meant ` cover everybody else but me,''' the source said, referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But White House spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the administration had good reason to seek the exclusion for presidents. The bill may have prevented `` a current president from consulting with a past president,'' he said. `` We felt the president should be removed because of his unique status,'' said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` The president would n't be able to talk to anybody in the government ... His work involves the entire government. It's in the national interest for a sitting president to be able to consult past presidents.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said there's never been an example of a president lobbying the government after leaving office, adding `` the notion that it would occur is somewhat demeaning to the presidency.'' He noted ex-vice presidents are covered by the restrictions, and should be because many have entered private business. Current anti-lobbying language is silent on presidential coverage, but presidents are considered excluded under a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ruling. `` In every version until the last one, the intention was to cover the president. We exempted the president at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s request,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>'s spokesman Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., the prime author of lobbying restrictions in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, called the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's position `` inconsistent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said, `` lobbied so hard to make -LRB- the restrictions -RRB- tougher. The president wanted a provision that people could n't even lobby for free.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he reluctantly accepted the president's request when the pay and ethics package reached the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because, `` We could n't negotiate everything. Provisions of the new legislation, some similar to current law and some going beyond it, would: _ Impose a lifetime ban on lobbying on matters where former officials were `` personally and substantially involved. _ Require a two-year ban on former officials lobbying on matters that were under their supervision, even if they had not directly participated _ Prohibit lobbying for a year by those personally and substantially involved in any trade or treaty negotiation _ Impose a one-year ban on top senior executives from lobbying their former agency on any matter in which the ex-officials would seek official action _ Bar any former top official, for one year, from representing, aiding or advising a foreign government or foreign political party in a matter before any department or agency

 So many funeral processions in one day. Five, and this stricken town's sorrow seemed even greater because the coffins were so small. One was covered with a teddy bear-shaped wreath of flowers. A stuffed <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> doll, a small dinosaur and baseball cards lay nearby. It was apparent that the bells tolled for the children, not for the spirit of the town. `` It will take time, maybe a long time, but we will get through this,'' <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> was saying, standing on the lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> where people gathered Monday for the last of the five funerals that gray and chilly afternoon. `` The tragedy was the worst we have ever had,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. `` At least it shook us more than any I know of. But I believe it brought us closer together as a community, as neighbors, and I have a feeling that will last.'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> was in charge of the first unit of volunteer firefighters who responded Thursday to a call from the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coldenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. A tornado had smashed down a wall of brick and glass onto the children at lunch, killing seven youngsters and injuring 18 others. The town's collective grief was manifest at the two funerals on Saturday and the five others Monday. Three of the five families chose to keep the services private, to bear their sorrow alone. Others did not. About 600 mourners crowded St. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Assisi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a grand old brick edifice with twin bell towers and stained glass windows. Over the generations, it has been the site of hundreds of funerals but surely few as unsettling as the requiem for <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Soltis </PERSON>, age 7. `` We remember today our little brother <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and his schoolmates,'' said the pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>. The organ sounded joyful, and 600 voices found solace in ancient rites: `` He will raise you up on eagles' wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of his hand. ... `` The music swelled within the church where 13 priests wore white and gold vestments. The priests surrounded the candles aglow with life, the white flowers, the little coffin draped in white, so tiny before the altar beneath the vault of the ceiling. `` We have our faith,'' said an elderly woman, turning, cheeks wet, to embrace the younger man next to her. `` And each other,'' he replied. About 100 people went to a funeral home to mourn <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` C.J.'' Scotto, 7, who lay in an eggshell-colored casket decorated with the teddy bear-shaped wreath of carnations and daisies. Nearby were his Garfield doll, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jets </ORGANIZATION> pin and <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>.'s other treasures. The service at First Presbyterian was for <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuhmer </PERSON>, 8. Also buried Monday were <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtler </PERSON>, 7, and <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Innis </PERSON>, 8. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larae </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Litchhult </PERSON>, both 8, were buried Saturday. <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, mother of four, is a nurse at one of the hospitals where injured children were taken. She stood at the door of a room where <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, both age 7, lay in beds with their broken limbs encased in plaster suspended from traction slings. She watched the firefighters who rescued them drop by to touch them and bring them gifts. `` They were stressed out,'' she said. `` They wanted to come and see the children they saved rather than dwell on the children they could not. They certainly brought smiles to the faces of those two.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> had another thought that seemed to reflect a feeling prevalent in this normally placid <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> town. `` The deaths, the injuries, made me step back and think of my own life and my values, think of the few things that I've been upset about recently. `` All of them mean absolutely nothing in the perspective of one tragic afternoon.''

While at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Koch </ORGANIZATION> was involved in a number of efforts to encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies' participation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s construction industry `` It is clear that Ms. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> traded on her position at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to gain benefits and access for herself and her clients,'' said the report. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is not bound by the recommendation but generally conducts preliminary reviews of matters referred to it by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or government agencies. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was not in her office Monday, according to a receptionist at the Virginia-based consulting firm, Construction, Marketing and Trading. In April testimony to the subcommittee and in a subsequent interview, she denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for policy development from 1984 to 1987. Her duties included arranging <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> participation in a number of trade issues involving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including agency participation in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> trade fair the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found was a waste of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money. She left the agency in 1987 and founded the consulting firm, whose clients included 10 companies that participated in the HUD-sponsored Soviet trip. She also was retained as a consultant to then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> on Soviet-related matters. The report said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> took a number of steps that appeared designed to benefit her business and clients in alleged violation of laws that prevent former government officials from improperly using their government contacts for private gain. Among the steps cited in the report were contacting <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and allegedly pressuring them to change the itineraries for visiting Soviet delegations so that they could meet with her clients. `` Ms. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> enjoyed access to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and to visiting Soviet delegations that was not generally offered to others,'' the report said. `` Such access gave Ms. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and her clients an advantage over competitors who might be interested in developing Soviet trade relations.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had received permission from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel to serve as a consultant at the same time her company was involved in Soviet trade issues, but the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> attorneys had advised agency officials to closely monitor her activities to prevent any conflicts. However, the report said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> failed to monitor her activities. It recommended that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and other government agencies avoid even the appearance of conflicts by refusing to hire former officials as consultants in areas in which the former officials now are involved in the private sector.

 The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen Tuesday, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ended at a record high. The dollar closed at 144.43 yen, down 0.24 yen from Monday's close of 144.67 yen It opened at 144.30 yen and moved between 144.30 yen and 144.48 yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 166.29 points, or 0.46 percent, closing at 36,059.87, a record high. It had lost 70.16 points Monday. Tuesday's close was the first beyond 36,000 line.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet collided with a civilian aircraft on a runway at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> Naval Air Station, officials said. No injuries were reported. A TA-4 training jet had landed Monday night and was slowing to taxi speed when a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> T-47 aircraft crossed the path, said retired Capt. <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKamey </PERSON>, spokesman for the base. The collision occurred three days after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ended its service-wide safety review that temporarily halted normal operations due to a rash of accidents. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately determine who was responsible for Monday's accident. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will investigate, <PERSON> McKamey </PERSON> said. Two military men were in the jet, and four people were in the civilian plane. The accident, which occurred about 6:30 p.m., caused a minor fuel leak, <PERSON> McKamey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> closed the air field after the accident. Last week's <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> stand-down included a safety review for personnel following an unprecedented string of accidents. Since Oct. 29, 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 71 injured in accidents such as sailors being washed overboard, plane crashes, ship fires and the accidental bombing of a cruiser.

<HEAD>Safety Groups Rank Car Manufacturers on Air Bag Installation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five Asian carmakers rank at the bottom in providing and promoting air bags in their 1990 cars, a coalition of auto safety and consumer groups said today. The groups ranked <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at the top among 12 major manufacturers selling cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is putting air bags in the driver's side of 92 percent of its 1990 models. Three million of the 10 million 1990 cars expected to be sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have air bags under federal rules, according to a report compiled by Public Citizen, the Center for Auto Safety and Motor Voters. But some drivers may not know what they've got, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of the <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader-founded </PERSON> <PERSON> Public </PERSON> <PERSON> Citizen </PERSON> and former head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s engine seems to be stuck in neutral on air bags,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>. She said the agency needs to promote air bags and closely monitor their use to perfect the various systems being installed in new cars. `` People should know when they buy the car that this system is going to inflate,'' Ms. <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON> said in an interview, adding some drivers have been surprised by air bags they did n't know were in their cars until they crashed. The three safety groups were releasing data on air bag installation and promotion at a news conference today. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>, which do not have air bags in any models, ranked at the bottom of the auto safety groups' `` report card,'' followed by <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>. Other low-ranking manufacturers included <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, which placed 8th and 9th. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> was 7th, preceded by <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> in 6th place and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> in 5th. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> tied for 3rd place, behind <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and Mercedes. Air bags were first installed in 10,000 General Motors cars in the mid-1970s but were not used again until they were introduced in some Fords in 1985. Auto safety proponents have been pushing for both air bags and a lap and shoulder belts for all front-seat occupants. Federal rules applying to the 1990 models require either driver's side air bags or another passive restraint system for both front seats in all new cars sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some manufacturers have opted for seat belts that automatically encircle front seat occupants as they step into the car. The safety groups ranked car builders according to the number of 1990 models equipped with the safety devices as standard equipment, plans for future installation of air bags, protection devices used in all car seating positions and information provided to dealers and the contents of company ads. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said auto dealers are not giving customers proper information about air bags. He said <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> dealers told consumer surveyors air bags might blow up in the driver's face, which he called `` a stunning piece of misinformation.'' A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, said she had never heard of such a claim being made by <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> dealers. `` We would not be putting air bags in our cars if they were not considered safe,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> offers air bags only in its top-line Legends but plans to add them to other models, Ms. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>, of Motor Voters, said the groups are most concerned about the lack of availability of air bags in lower-priced models. `` These cars are most likely to be purchased by young drivers most likely to be involved in a crash,'' she said. The groups said all manufacturers have done poorly in providing air bags for vehicles other than passenger cars. No company plans installation of air bags in vans until the 1993 models, when both <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will introduce them in minivans.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Proposes Program to Tighten Gun Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> wants to prevent felons from purchasing weapons by requiring that gun dealers check computerized criminal records before sales are completed. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Monday that the plan will take time and significant amounts of money to put in place, with states and the federal government needing to upgrade and computerize criminal records so they could be checked by gun dealers. `` While a comprehensive, accurate system for identifying felons at the point-of-sale simply can not be accomplished in the near term, we must recognize it as a worthwhile goal to be accomplished over time,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. Under the attorney general's proposal, licensed firearms dealers would use a touch-tone telephone to check computer records to find if each prospective gun purchaser had a felony conviction. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he was ordering the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to expand its computerized data base of felons prohibited from buying guns. At present, only 40 percent to 60 percent of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> conviction records are computerized. The bureau was also ordered to draft standards for reporting criminal records for state and local police agencies. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the department's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> will set aside $ 9 million for each of the next three years to help states comply with new reporting standards. Under legislation enacted last year, the attorney general was required to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on what steps could be taken to prevent felons from purchasing guns. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> rejected a more expensive option submitted to him by a task force that would have set up a system to instantly check the fingerprints of purchasers in gun stores to determine if they had criminal records. The task force estimated it would cost up to $ 27 billion to automate fingerprint records and install scanning equipment in gun stores. The attorney general said records will have to be improved before a new system can work. `` No one list of felons exists. In addition, many of the criminal history records maintained by law enforcement are either out of date or incomplete, or both,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` Finally, current records often contain arrest information without a notation of the final disposition.'' The task force estimated it would cost between $ 36 million and $ 46 million to set up a telephone system for checking computerized records. The system would cost $ 53 million to $ 70 million to operate each year. The task force said a $ 7 to $ 9 fee charged to each prospective gun buyer would cover much of the costs.

 Nicaraguan government negotiators are promising new proposals they say would overcome differences blocking an agreement with the Contra rebels on restoring a cease-fire. Contra negotiators are pledging new ideas of their own but, after eight negotiating sessions, they sound far less optimistic than their Sandinista counterparts on the possibility for success. The talks were scheduled to resume today. `` We will try to present something ... that will pull us out of this stalemate,'' said the chief Contra negotiator, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, after a two-hour negotiating session Monday at the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said, `` We're going to stretch flexibility as far as it can be stretched ... We are approaching the end of the effort.'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said his government is reassessing its insistence that the Contras agree to a total withdrawal from Nicaraguan territory to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as its price for agreeing to a cease fire. He left the impression the government may settle for a partial withdrawal. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suspended the cease-fire on Nov. 1 after alleging the Contra forces had engaged in terrorist activities. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> accused the Sandinistas of hardening their position by insisting on both the withdrawal of the Contras and their demobilization but <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> misunderstood the Sandinista position. A commission made of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> mediators spent the weekend drawing up revisions of a plan they had set forth during the early going of the negotiations, which began Nov. 9. Part of Monday's negotiating session was spent going over the revisions. Before the talks resumed Monday, rebel spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> accused the Sandinistas of not negotiating in good faith. `` They want a total surrender,'' he said. `` They want an unconditional surrender.'' <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> called for an immediate cease-fire with appropriate verification procedures. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> reaffirmed his government's view that the cease-fire must be linked to a `` separation of forces'' _ meaning the withdrawal of Contra forces to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` That's fundamental,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> also disclosed he had a brief meeting with a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official Saturday to discuss issues relating to the staffing of the respective embassies of the two countries. He did n't identify the official with whom he spoke. The administration generally has avoided high-level contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, urging them instead to focus attention on resolving their differences with both the Contras and the internal opposition.

 When asked to name some qualities that make this country special, one young man offers, `` cable TV.'' Asked how to encourage more young people to vote, one young woman replies, `` Pay them.'' People for the American Way used these examples from a survey of youth values Monday to sound a warning that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youth are alarmingly ill-prepared to keep democracy alive in the 1990s and beyond.'' `` Our survey confirmed our worst fear: <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youth are turned off and tuning out the community and country around them,'' said the group's president, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>. `` While the youth of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and elsewhere are struggling for democracy, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youth are leaving democracy to wither,'' said <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>. `` While youth behind the Iron Curtain are reveling in that little freedom they have been allowed, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youth are taking their very real freedoms for granted.'' The survey of 1,100 young people ages 15-24 and 405 social studies teachers was conducted in four parts between April and June by <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. Key findings were: _ 72 percent of the youth, asked to grade various life goals on a scale of 1 to 10, gave a 9 or 10 to `` career success''; 68 percent gave high ratings to `` having a close-knit family life,'' and 56 percent to `` enjoying life and having a good time. Twenty-four percent listed helping the community. _ Most young people do not see their own destiny as linked with the nation's While a strong majority are confident about their own personal prospects, only 42 percent of young people surveyed say they feel optimistic about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future. About 47 percent say they are worried that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best years might be behind us. _ Only 12 percent of the youth surveyed volunteered `` voting'' as a basic tenet of good citizenship Comparing the citizenship potential of today's young people with those of a decade ago, 37 percent of the teachers surveyed think today's youth are less likely to become good citizens, while 16 percent say today's students are more likely to become good citizens than those of 10 years ago _ By a more than 2-1 ratio _ 45 percent to 21 percent _ teachers say today's high school students are less interested in politics and public affairs than their counterparts of a decade ago _ 60 percent of the young people say they know `` just some'' or `` very little'' about the way our government works When it comes to reading the newspaper or watching the news on television, 57 percent say they have `` just some'' or `` very little'' interest in following news about politics and government. _ 54 percent of teachers cite the `` poor example'' set by politicians as a `` strong reason'' for youths' non-involvement <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> said the `` hopeful signs'' in the survey are that 58 percent reject the notion that `` people should take care of themselves and should n't expect others to do things for them,'' while 35 percent agree with that idea. Also, 89 percent of the youth support a community service program in their high school that offers extra credit to students who volunteer. People For the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> called for an `` all-out effort to teach every young person in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the full meaning of citizenship.'' He said parents must vote and become involved in the community, schools must provide more community service opportunities and political leaders must set a positive example that inspires citizen activism.

<HEAD>France's `Great Fear' of 1789 Was Caused by Hallucinogen, Historian
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> historian is adding a hallucinogenic note to the longstanding mystery of what triggered three weeks of terror in the French countryside that became a key event in the revolution of 1789. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilburne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattossian </PERSON>, in a new book called `` Poisons of the Past: Molds, Epidemics and History,'' says the phenomenon historians call the Great Fear was probably caused by hallucinogens contained in a fungus on rye wheat. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a professor of European History at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and an authority on the French Revolution, said he has not read Ms. <PERSON> Matossian </PERSON>'s book but is familiar with her thesis and does not put much stock in it. `` I am not a biologist and have n't investigated, but I simply have n't taken it very seriously,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We believe that the Great Fear was caused by the revolution in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the storming of the Bastille and specifically by the fear that the aristocrats were going to wage a counter-revolution against that revolution in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> and that they were setting loose brigands into the countryside to destroy their crops,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Matossian </PERSON>, an associate professor of history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, blames the fear on ergot, a fungus that grows on rye in certain conditions and contains the alkaloid lysergic acid, from which the hallucinogenic drug LSD is extracted. Her view clashes with those of many historians that the phenomenon was an insurrection of peasants who resented paying taxes and tithes. `` In the spring of 1789 there were peasant protests against the food shortage and ` feudal' practices, but the Great Fear of July and August was mainly a panic, not a protest,'' she writes in her book, published by <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Previous studies have indicated there was no foundation for these fears because, although there were vagrants roaming the countryside in search of food, they were apparently neither organized nor dangerous. `` There has been documentation that shows that it was based on rumor,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Somebody would come to the outskirts of a village and announce that a troop of brigands were arriving and then somebody would go to the next village and multiply the number by 10, and it went on and on like that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Matossian </PERSON>'s book was based on research in libraries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. She said her conclusion was based on `` a series of interesting coincidences that make a causal connection plausible.'' She cited a previous study of public health in <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION> that reported toxic ergot had been found on about one-twelfth of all ears of rye in the region in July 1789. `` This was indeed a prodigious amount,'' she wrote. `` Rye flour containing 1 percent ergot is sufficient to cause a full-blown epidemic.'' The Great Fear went on for three weeks. Weeping and shouting peasants took to the woods with pitchforks and muskets while others crisscrossed the countryside looting and burning chateaus. It led <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> aristocrats to abandon some of their feudal privileges, and prompted a reaction among landowners who maintained order should be restored in the countryside before further concessions were made.

<HEAD>Defense Cuts Could Produce Proposal for Further Troop Reductions
in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may propose a new round of American troop reductions in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ provided they are matched by Soviet cutbacks _ as a result of an easing of East-West tensions, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. Government studies, started before the current wave of political reform struck the communist world, are being accelerated also to consider new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget constraints, the officials said Monday. The studies _ and a recommendation to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ could be completed in time for his Dec. 2-3 meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. In any event, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is likely to pursue the subject with leaders of the 15 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries when he meets with them in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> right after the saltwater summit. `` Some of them are a little nervous about additional reductions,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Those issues, as well as questions about possible German reunification, were expected to be raised today in a meeting between visiting West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. West German officials said <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s visit was prompted by the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and other changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in May that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops be reduced to 275,000 from their current level of about 305,000. The proposal and across-the-board cutbacks in the allies' tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are under negotiation with the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The reductions are contingent upon even deeper reductions by the Soviet-led bloc. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> advanced its own comprehensive proposal in the talks. Progress has been slowed by disagreement over the kinds of aircraft to place under ceilings and a dispute between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> over whether to include the Turkish port of <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION> in an East-West treaty. An argument being made here against a proposal for a second round of cuts is that it could slow the current negotiations, the officials said. But clearly the administration is thinking beyond a troop reduction of about 10 percent, the officials said. One of them cited a recent <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> decision to have some American troops along the East-West border carry revolvers instead of rifles. The official said this reflected a lessening of tensions `` and is indicative of some major revamping.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Sunday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would consider troop reduction proposals that went far beyond the cuts involved in the negotiations. The two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Monday the options under study were to revise the current <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal to make deeper cuts or to frame a second proposal that would be negotiated after a treaty is concluded. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had predicted completion of the pact by next May, but since then many experts within the administration have registered doubts privately that the accord could be concluded by then. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said `` it is premature'' to talk about a second proposal for cutbacks in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conventional forces. She said `` if we were to do such a thing, it would obviously have to be carefully explored with our allies in the context of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' program, said the likelihood of a conflict between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was `` at its lowest point since World War II.'' He also said he would agree to military cuts to meet deficit-reduction goals.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed above the 36,000-point level for the first time today, while the dollar edged down against the Japanese yen. The dollar closed at 144.43 yen, down 0.24 yen from Monday's close of 144.67 yen The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency opened at 144.30 yen, its low for the day, and ranged as high as 144.48 yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 166.29 points, or 0.46 percent, closing at 36,059.87, yet another high. The index previously has jumped momentarily over the 36,000-point mark in the course of trading, but today's close was the first beyond the 36,000-line. <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON> said the yen's stability against the dollar reassured Japanese investors and encouraged them to buy. Interest in a wide variety of issues also helped the index rise, despite intermittent selling by investment trust companies for profit-taking, he said. Among the winners were real estate, construction and electrical issues, including <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and Pioneer. An estimated 800 million shares changed hands on the market's first section, up from Monday's 700 million shares In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate stayed within a narrow range because of a lack of fresh market-affecting news, said a Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Only the British pound showed any major fluctuations today, he said. Market players sold the British currency following rumors that the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> might intervene in the market, he said. But investors were leery of letting the dollar approach the 144.50-yen mark because of fear of prompting dollar-selling by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the trader added. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank reportedly sold about $ 200 million on Monday to stem the dollar's rise. Spot trading volume was estimated at $ 3.77 billion.

 A 400-pound, bright yellow mechanical arm replaces the human touch at the Robot Music Store, where customers sample and buy compact discs entirely by machine. The robot system plays 30-second samples of song for its customers, takes their orders and accepts payment by cash or credit card. It also hands over the merchandise, returns change and receipts, restocks shelves and places its own inventory orders. Developers claim the shop, which opened Monday, is the first fully automated retail store. `` Anyone who can operate a CD machine can operate this,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who, along with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahlander </PERSON>, founded <ORGANIZATION> Robot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> more than three years ago in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION>, 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The company's robot frying cooks are being tested in two McDonald's outlets. The `` store'' is something like a giant vending machine in the open court shopping area of a large office building. CDs are stacked on shelves on the inside walls of a transparent enclosure covering 140 square feet and standing about 8 feet high. On the outside are four earphone sets, a video screen for customers to punch in transactions and fixtures to take in the money or credit cards and deliver CDs and change. At the center of the operation is the robot arm that can rotate around the enclosure to grab a customer's selection and deliver it. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cahlander </PERSON> said they will test the idea in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> to see if it is profitable and whether customers like buying from a machine instead of a human. Initial reaction was mixed. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkel </PERSON>, waiting to get a closer look at the robot before buying, said she liked the idea of being able to listen to the music before making a purchase, but prefers to deal with a person. `` I like someone to be able to talk to me and tell me ` Ya, I heard this and I think it's great,''' <PERSON> Jenkel </PERSON> said. Monday's test of the technology was marred by one glitch. The robot arm was shut down for a five-minute repair after it had trouble dispensing a classical CD, said <PERSON> Cahlander </PERSON>. The arm will have to be retooled to pick up CDs with boxes of varying sizes, he said. Using the machine is much like banking at an automatic teller. If customers have trouble, there is a toll-free telephone number to call for help, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. If similar machines are in use, `` nobody else has talked about it,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittelstadt </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> GMFanuc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the basic robot unit.

 When the plaintiffs are human and the defendants are beasts, being a lawyer can get pretty hairy _ except when it's your specialty For five years, <PERSON> Joleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> has been the pet set's <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. She runs Legal Action for Animals, a Manhattan-based, non-profit group that advises on and litigates a range of animal issues, including pet privileges, lab experimentation and malpractice lawsuits against veterinarians. `` We get about 70 calls a week from across the country on complaints about everything from experimental torture done on animals, to elderly people who want to know if they can bring their cats to a nursing home,'' she said. In one instance, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> man claimed that a beaver's dam had backed up a septic tank, resulting in a foul overflow at his home. `` Unfortunately he wanted to exterminate the creature and would have gotten a permit to do so if it were n't for our intervention,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> alerted a group that specialized in beaver behavior and they were able to scare off the animal without harming it. In another case, a student objected to experiments on marsh turtles at his community college. Upon Ms. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>'s investigation, the labs were closed because they were n't registered with the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've always had a love for animals and a deep concern over how many of them were homeless. I eventually ended up going to law school because of it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, who allows two big dogs and five `` loveable'' cats to frolic in her <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> home. She attended <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where she studied environmental law. Today, she teaches animal law at <ORGANIZATION> Pace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. When she opened her practice in 1984, her office was in her living room. Now, she and four part-time interns _ assisted by 20 volunteer attorneys on call around the country _ work out of a 42nd Street office donated by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, an animal advocacy group. Although she has prosecuted people-animal cases, Ms. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> says most of the time litigation is n't necessary. `` It's more a matter of the law and a person's constitutional rights,'' she said. For example, she took up the case of a high school student who refused to dissect a frog; she claimed that the student's First Amendment rights were at issue. Ultimately, an alternate assignment was made. Ms. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> said there are few malpractice cases against veterinarians, but courts have become willing to grant punitive damages for emotional distress to owners whose animals died in veterinary care. `` There is very little on the books for animal rights. But courts are very sympathetic to animal cases; judges are beginning to realize that animals are not just inanimate objects,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Tape Said to Show Nicaraguan Link to Salvadoran Left</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are touting a smuggled videotape purporting to show Salvadoran guerilla leaders at a training base outside <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> as evidence of Nicaraguan complicity in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s insurgency. But Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> dismissed the tape as a `` propaganda show'' that represents another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to blame <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for the Salvadoran civil war. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for cease-fire negotiations with the Contra rebels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who showed the tape to reporters Monday said three men who appear in the videotape are top Salvadoran guerrilla commanders, including <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>, generally regarded as the most important figure in the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, insurgent hierarchy. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the light artillery and anti-aircraft weapons shown have been used extensively by rebels during recent fighting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> but had not been seen before this spring. The tape is believed to have been made in either May or June of this year and was turned over to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities by a person who wished to remain anonymous, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. It was not disclosed who made the tape or what the purpose was. The original tape was said to be more than three hours long but the officials said the final product was reduced to the five minutes. They said it underscored the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> connection with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. The officials said some of the same types of weapons shown on the tape were used by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> rebels in an October 30 attack on Salvadoran Army headquarters and the Nov. 11 attacks on the private and official residences of Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts concluded the site of the taping was the El Tempisque training site north of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> because of the terrain and the presence of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons found nowhere else in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> besides <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The tape was described by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official as `` graphic confirmation'' that the Nicaraguan government has provided weapons training to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. Nicaraguan officials have said there may have been some unauthorized operations carried out by Sandinista officials in support of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980's but that these activities have long since stopped. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has said repeatedly Nicaraguan territory will not be used to subvert neighboring countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have cited the alleged Sandinista support, dating back almost a decade, as a principal reason for generous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military support for the Salvadoran government. As further evidence of Nicaraguan cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, the administration has said that on Oct. 18 it captured large quantities of weapons allegedly earmarked by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. The arms were said to be found by <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> security guards aboard a truck near the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 An Australian who was adopted by missionaries was convicted of murdering an interior decorator in a case whose notoriety enabled him to be reunited with his biological mother. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, convicted Monday of first-degree murder, robbery and sexual battery, could be sentenced to die in the electric chair when the jury returns Dec. 11 for the penalty phase. Savage, 26, was adopted in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> when he was 4 months old and brought to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at age 7. His biological mother, <PERSON> Beverley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Whyman </PERSON>, who learned of his whereabouts because of the case, contended he was wrongly taken from her under a discontinued government program to turn aborigine children over to white adoptive parents. `` They took my son away from me 26 years ago, and they just killed me tonight,'' said the weeping Ms. <PERSON> Whyman </PERSON>. `` My son is paying for his own mistakes and for the Australian government's mistakes. Two benches behind Ms. <PERSON> Whyman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s adoptive mother, <PERSON> Nesta </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, wiped tears from her eyes and clung to her husband, <PERSON> Graeme </PERSON>, as the verdict was read. The couple, who returned from missionary work in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to attend the trial, refused comment. The <ORGANIZATION> Brevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury, which deliberated for eight hours before announcing the verdicts, has the option of recommending life in prison or death. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, who has a long criminal record in this country, was accused of sexually assaulting and strangling <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> in an alley behind her interior design showroom on Nov. 23, 1988. His attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, acknowledged that <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> killed Ms. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, but argued the charge should be reduced to second-degree murder, which carries a maximum term of life imprisonment. Savage's heavy use of crack reduced his culpability, argued <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who also denied the defendant raped Ms. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> But Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Bausch </PERSON> said the murder could n't be blamed on drugs. `` I do n't care if you are black, white, an American, an Australian or an aborigine,'' <PERSON> Bausch </PERSON> said. `` No one has the right to perform or commit the criminal actions <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> committed on <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> last year.'' Aboriginal activists in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> _ who raised money to send Ms. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> to the trial _ want him returned to his homeland, where he would n't face the death penalty. The Australian government has n't decided if it will seek a role in the penalty phase of the trial, said Australian Consul <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindeman </PERSON>, who attended the week-long trial. Before the trial, Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> allowed a defense motion that <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> be referred to as <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, his birth name. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> contended the name <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> might cause the jury to think of `` an uncivilized primitive.'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> has served four prison sentences for car theft, burglary and violent behavior in prison, including trying to kill a fellow inmate and a guard. Mrs. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, said the family was pleased by Monday's verdict `` Yes, I want him to get the electric chair,'' <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> said.

The money has not been awarded so far.

 Hundreds of ballot boxes, thousands of gallons of ink, batallions of police, and even homing pigeons were transported to polling centers today for elections in the world's most populous democracy Opinion polls indicate Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could lose power in the voting, which begins Wednesday. It faces a loose-knit opposition coalition of five parties led by <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, once among <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s closest allies. The voting for a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> follows a hectic, often bitter three-week campaign highlighted by charges of government corruption. It was punctuated by violence that left 27 people dead across the nation. Fifteen of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 25 states and five of its seven federally-ruled territories vote Wednesday. The rest of the country goes to the polls Friday and Sunday. At least 3.7 million government officials will supervise voting at 600,000 polling centers. A total of 524 seats in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, or the House of the People, are at stake and there are 6,090 candidates. Nearly 500 million people are eligible to vote. With only a literacy rate of 36 percent in a nation of 880 million people, voters will choose candidates by stamping symbols representing each candidate. The left forefinger of each voter is then marked with indelible ink to signify that he or she has voted. In the eastern regions in <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> state, authorities have trained pigoens to carry messages from remote regions to the state police control. The paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> issued instructions to carefully watch people wearing shawls or blankets `` in case they are carrying weapons or bombs underneath.'' At least 100,000 people from the force will be deployed in addition to regular police. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, a former airline pilot, succeeded his mother, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, after she was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct. 31, 1984. Two months later, he and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won an unprecedented 415 of the 543 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. But his government has been haunted for more than two years by charges of high-level corruption, and his popularity has plunged. Opposition leaders have made much of a $ 1.4 billion artillery contract signed in 1986 with <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, the Swedish arms manufacturer. They and Indian newspapers say senior government officials received up to $ 50 million in kickbacks in the 1986 deal. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has repeatedly denied the charges. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> served as finance and defense minister under <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> but left the government in 1987 after ordering an investigation into a defense deal. He was later expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Opinion polls suggest <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party might need the support of Hindu fundamentalists or Communists to form the next government. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which spearheaded the struggle that culminated in independence 42 years ago, has won the majority of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seats in seven elections. In 1977, however, the traditionally fractious opposition united to oust <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But that government fell apart 29 months later, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> came back to power in the 1980 elections. This year, major opposition parties again united but many voters still have doubts about the durability. This year, voting will not be held in the 14 seats in the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, where voters' lists are not ready. Polls for four other seats have been postponed because of the deaths of candidates. In one constituency, a candidate was returned unopposed.

<HEAD>Peru Closes Border to Stop Dollar Speculators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has closed its road borders with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> to slow the flight of dollars after they soared to a record high on the black market as a hedge against galloping inflation. Officials took the measure late Monday after the black-market dollar hit an unprecedented high earlier in the day. It was selling on the street for 11,200 Peruvian intis after opening the day at 9,200. Finance Minister <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazan </PERSON> said in a television interview Monday afternoon, `` There is no objective reason for the rise.'' <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazan </PERSON> had said then the government would consider closing the Chilean border and enforcing stricter customs regulations to stop the `` double profits'' of speculators `` who make money on the dollar and then make money on the contraband'' they bring back to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. He said many speculators cross the border into <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> with dollars and buy consumer goods to sell in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbiola </PERSON>, prefect of the department of Puno 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, said by telephone on Monday night that the measure originally adopted for the Chilean border was extended to cover the Bolivian and Ecuadorean borders. <PERSON> Urbiola </PERSON> said the two main roads into <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> were closed to traffic Monday night. A spokesperson for the department of <LOCATION> Tacna </LOCATION>, 700 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, confirmed late Monday that the Chilean border had been closed. Officials did not say how long the closures would last. In the past two weeks, the price of the dollar has nearly doubled on the black market. Many people in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> buy black-market dollars to offset the country's hyperinflation, and many businesses obtain dollars to pay for imports on the black market. The inflation rate for 1988 was more than 1,700 percent, and this year it is expected to top 3,000 percent. The official exchange rate, which is used only for some government transactions and to pay for certain imports, was 4,557 intis to the dollar Monday.

<HEAD>Proposals Aired for Overcoming Japanese Lead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A nationwide schooling system for 4-year-olds of poor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> families and ending or cutting income taxes on savings would help restore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership in semiconductors, according to a report. After originating the semiconductor industry and dominating it for three decades, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has lost the lead to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and has not responded to the challenge of regaining it, said the first report of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Semiconductors. The body created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year is made up of industrial executives and government experts under the chairmanship of <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. The report issued Monday also proposed resurrecting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer electronics industry with seed money from government-guaranteed investments to help provide incentives and affordable capital needed for a major research and development efforts. A nationwide preschool educational system for economically disadvantaged 4-year-olds would be a step toward improving the quality of worker education, the report said. `` For every dollar invested in quality preschool, seven are returned to society during the lifetime of the child in the form of increased earnings, less crime and less welfare,'' the committee said. It also recommended subsidized literacy programs, permanent tax concessions for research and easing of limits on tax-free retirement savings accounts known as IRAs. The 30-page report also included recommendations for overtaking <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in semiconductors such as pressure for reciprocal treatment in market access, threat of sanctions against unfair trade and relaxing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> antitrust laws. Ironically, many of the recommendations paralleled Japanese advice for sharpening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness in the two countries' ongoing economic structural talks, such as better education and higher savings If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position in semiconductors continues to deteriorate, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics industry will be at the mercy of foreign suppliers, jeopardizing millions of jobs, billions of dollars of tax revenue, industrial strength and national defense, the report said. The shift to importing most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer electronics items such as television sets and audio equipment from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> has been underrated as a factor in deterioration of semiconductor leadership, the study said. It said the government should take the lead in establishing a for-profit <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> to resurrect the domestic industry with a multi-billion dollar pool of low-cost, long-term private investments.

 Buck Helm, the longshoreman who became a symbol of hope after the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake, had an undiagnosed heart ailment that made his long fight for life all the more incredible, his doctor said. Helm, who suffered injuries to virtually every organ in his body when his car was crushed under the collapsing upper deck of Interstate 880, had an enlarged ventricle discovered in an autopsy, Dr. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said Monday. Helm, 58, died Saturday after a 28-day fight for his life, including four days trapped in his compact car. `` The fact that he lived the four days he did -LRB- on the freeway -RRB- was a miracle,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` The fact that he had to handle it with a bad heart is even more of a miracle.'' For many who survived the Oct. 17 quake _ which measured 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, killed 67 and did $ 7 billion in damage _ the Interstate 880 survivor embodied hopes for recovery. The defect in Helm's ventricle, a chamber in the heart that pumps blood to the arteries, was undetectable while <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> was alive, said <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, chief of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, one of the hospitals where Helm was treated. The heart problem combined with a fast-spreading blood infection to kill Helm, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. A bacterial infection entered his blood with the rupture of an abscess in an abdominal wound that may have been caused by the seat-belt buckle of his car, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. The heart, already weakend by the defect, got infected. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said he had been optimistic about Helm's recovery but admitted that much of his attitude was founded on hope. He called Helm's injuries `` overwhelming.'' Helm, who commuted 250 miles to rural from the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to rural <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION> to visit his family on weekends, was trapped in his crushed car for 89 hours. Funeral services were scheduled for this afternoon in <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>. Helm is survived by his former wife, <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON>, and four children: <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>, 16; <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>, 22; <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON>, 12; and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON>, 35.

<HEAD>Two Federal Nuclear Plants to Lay Off Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 325 employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s Y-12 nuclear weapons plant will be getting layoff notices within the next week, plant officials said. Also, operators of the federal <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> uranium processing plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> announced about 130 workers are being laid off. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> layoffs at the 6,900-employee plant are the result of a $ 7 million cut in its $ 590 million fiscal 1990 budget, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, which manages the plant under a DOE contract, said last week that Gramm-Rudman cuts could chop an additional $ 20 million to $ 25 million from the Y-12 budget, causing more layoffs <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> said Monday it could be weeks before it's known whether the plant will have to absorb Gramm-Rudman reductions. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s Feed Materials Production Center, said its layoffs of production workers take effect Dec. 15 Plant spokeman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> anticipates a $ 6 million shortfall in its fiscal 1990 budget. He said if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacts additional reductions, more layoffs at could follow. Production at the plant near <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, an unincorporated community 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, has been suspended while the site undergoes inspection and cleanup. A <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> statement said the company has no schedule for restart of uranium processing `` in the near future.'' The 38-year-old plant processes uranium for use in <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nuclear reactors elsewhere in the government's production of nuclear weapons <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> suspended production in July to concentrate on cleaning up the plant's 1,050-acre site, where thousands of pounds of radioactive wastes are stored in steel drums and ground pits.

 An oil and mining services company that is purchasing The <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> promised not to interfere with news coverage but said the editorial pages would be pro-development. `` Through being a pro-development paper, maybe we can create more jobs,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` People ca n't stay up here -LRB- <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> -RRB- unless they have jobs.'' Longtime owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said he sold the evening newspaper he's owned since 1935 to the <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> because he wanted to keep <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s No. 2 paper in local hands. Documents to complete the deal were signed Monday by the 82-year-old <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who said negotiations for the purchase began about 1 -LCB- years ago. The price was not disclosed. The sale is to become final Dec. 14. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said he did not see any conflict with his political activities, or with <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION>'s role as chief contractor for the Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> oil spill cleanup. `` Owning the paper is not going to change my political views. Any candidate I think is pro-development I'm probably going to support. But the paper will not be supporting my political beliefs,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The newspaper, which celebrates its 75th anniversary next year and is as old as <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, will remain the only locally owned and operated daily paper in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest city. `` It would have been a tragedy to have outside interests control both newspapers in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning morning newspaper owned by California-based <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> group. `` You'll see a change in the looks of the Times, the content of the Times, beginning in January,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` We'll keep the same editorial philosophy. We're going to put the facts on the front page and editorialize on the editorial page. `` There's not going to be any interference in the newsroom,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` They can report on <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> as they have in the past. All I ask is a more accurate story.'' <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> chafed at the coverage of its lengthy battle with the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> company </ORGANIZATION>'s payroll plan for campaign contributions. <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said he sold the Times to make it strong enough to compete with the <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> group. The Times, first was published in a tent during the construction of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, was long the dominant paper but now is No. 2 in circulation. The newspaper's circulation is 34,080 daily and 44,062 on Sundays, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulations </ORGANIZATION>' Sept. 30 figures The News' circulation is 57,671 daily and 73,337 on Sundays. <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> is buying the Times' assets but not The <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which will continue to be owned by <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said his company will commit substantial resources to the newspaper to expand state and local coverage.

<HEAD>U.N. Official: Donors Unhappy With Afghan Government's Success</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Many Western governments are withholding aid the Afghan people urgently need because they oppose the communist <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and want to help precipitate its downfall, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official says. Western donors had been counting on the swift defeat of the government following the Soviet military pullout, completed in February, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> told reporters Monday. `` They were taken by surprise that after the 15th of February, after the last of the foreign troops withdrew, that somehow a change in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> did not occur very quickly,'' said the prince, who coordinates Operation Salam, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief program for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said a reluctance to donate has prolonged the suffering of Afghans and discouraged the return of 5 million refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Why should they go back if their conditions outside are still better than those that they would find inside?'' he asked. The prince said many Western donors disapprove of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s communist government and believe sending aid into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will help prop up his administration. `` In point of fact, a very large part of the country, which is rural, is controlled by the opposition, by the resistance,'' he said. `` Two-thirds of the country is gradually returning to normal. `` The needs are comparatively greater in those areas, so by transferring aid to needy Afghan groups in areas controlled by the resistance, you would not be shoring up the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' said the prince. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> appealed last year for $ 1.2 billion for Afghan aid and reconstruction. The prince said the Western governments `` have not been extremely generous in responding to the secretary-general's appeal so far.'' His latest report, issued Monday, shows <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has pledged about $ 600 million in aid, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has pledged or given $ 20.1 million. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by contrast, has donated only $ 16.7 million in food and $ 2 million for instruction in clearing mines.

 <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> sure would n't have played it that way. Rocky Balboa fought in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Monday night. But he lost, in a bout so devoid of drama it was stopped by the referee in the fifth round. The story of <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> `` Rocky'' Balboa has little in common with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> prizefighter <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> played in the 1976 smash movie hit `` Rocky'' and its sequels. For one thing, the real `` Rocky'' is a welterweight not a heavyweight. He did n't train by slugging sides of beef in a <LOCATION> Philly </LOCATION> meat locker, slogging up the steps of the Art Museum or through the Italian Market on Ninth Street. And when he yells `` Yo,'' he means `` I.'' The 27-year-old <PERSON> Balboa </PERSON> is a native of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> who's now from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. About the only parallel with the movie that launched <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s movie career is that the real Rocky also was an underdog The man who beat him, <PERSON> Meldrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, is an Olympic gold medalist and unbeaten Junior Welterweight champ of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boxing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who is from the City of Brotherly Love, seemed to appreciate the irony. `` I think it's kind of sassy for Rocky Balboa to come to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and challenge me,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who dominated the fight from the outset. When <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> connected with two lefts in the fifth round, not even <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> the trainer or the lovely <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> could have saved <PERSON> Balboa </PERSON>, who says he was known as Rocky before anyone ever heard of <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>. `` A long time ago when I'd get together with my friends and fight they said I hit real hard,'' he said. `` They started calling me Rocky.''

 Star performances can enliven the creakiest of drawing room comedies, making the artifical and old-fashioned seem charming, funny and even poignant. That is the case at the Ambassador Theater where <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Granger </PERSON> and particularly <PERSON> Glynis </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> resuscitate <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Somerset </PERSON> <PERSON> Maugham </PERSON>'s `` The Circle,'' a hit from the 1921-22 Broadway season. If it were n't for this stylish trio of veterans, the play, which opened Monday night, would be little more than lightweight stuff. For nearly a half-hour after the curtain rises on designer <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Heeley </PERSON>'s opulent, flower-filled drawing room, <ORGANIZATION> Maugham </ORGANIZATION> sets up the plot, laboriously laying out the gossipy past. He tells how 30 years ago, the beautiful <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> ran off with the great Lord <PERSON> Porteous </PERSON>, leaving behind her husband <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> and 5-year-old son, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. Now, three decades later, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>'s head-strong but romantic wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, has invited the errant mother and her lover for lunch. Of course, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>'s ex-husband will be there, too, so the prospects of an uncomfortable reunion are downright certain. To add to the embarrassment, history may repeat itself. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> has fallen for another houseguest, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON>, a handsome colonialist from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The plot turns on whether <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> will run off with <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON>, making the same decision her mother-in-law made so many years ago. That is the principal plot development, but there is more fun in watching the aging lovers quarrel, renew their relationships and sharpen the points of their decades-old triangle. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, as the elderly playboy Lord <PERSON> Porteous </PERSON>, resembles a blinking British <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>, ever so polite and perplexed as he lumbers about the stage. He's still in love with the woman he ran away with 30 years ago, but ardor can be taken for granted after so long a time. And life keeps getting in the way. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s role is small, almost a throwaway, but the actor is such a presence that he makes it seem better and bigger than it really is. No one can growl out a line the way he can. Both <PERSON> Porteous </PERSON> and especially <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> realize what they have given up for love. He could have been prime minister. She gave up a devoted husband and young son. Maugham's play makes some surprisingly serious statements about the tradeoffs that people in love must make. <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> is the play's most frivolous yet perceptive character. Old age becomes her enemy, not her ex-husband. `` The tragedy of love is indifference,'' she counsels the distraught <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. That's why she dyes her gray hair, dresses in girlish pink and wears a lot of makeup. She wo n't give up without a fight. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> is superb. She plays the role delicately, yet with great comic spirit. She knows just how far to go with <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>'s scatter-brained comments and actions And there are genuine tears when she cries over an old photograph of her much younger self. If <PERSON> Granger </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>'s long-abandoned husband, ca n't quite keep up with the two other stars, he does a credible job. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> is the odd man out. But Maugham does not turn the husband into a moper. And he seems a more satisfied person than the lovers who did him wrong. Director <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, who supervises things at the slowest possible pace, has less luck with the triangle of younger lovers. <PERSON> Roma </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Venton </PERSON> are earth-bound as <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and her new-found love. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwick </PERSON> is prissy and unconvincing as her husband. You wonder why she married him in the first place. But audiences are there to see <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Granger </PERSON>, and you feel cheated when the other actors are on too much of the time. When the stars are center stage, `` The Circle'' seems complete. When they are not, this drawing room comedy is drawn out far too long. Critic <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON>, however, found the play `` creaked and wheezed a lot and managed to charm quite a bit,'' she wrote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>' lilting, autumnal voice is perfect; so is her fragile sense of duty. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> has raised crotchetiness to a great art. ... <PERSON> Granger </PERSON> has charm in abundance,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> wrote in the Daily News. When <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> argue, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said, `` one feels her bitterness even as one exults in the verbal chamber music created by two of the most distinctive speaking voices in the English theater.'' Critic <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, writing in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, praised the whole cast, especially <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s `` stately and ineffable charm tinged with a very correct arrogance.''

 An elephant who had been pregnant for more than two years was back on her feet after veterinarians completed a risky Caesarean section to remove a dead fetus. Six veterinarians and three equine surgeons at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> spent 5 -LCB- hours Monday on the procedure on <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, a 19-year-old, 7,000-pound Asian elephant who was believed to have been pregnant for more than 730 days. The normal gestation period is between 618 and 648 days. The Caesarean section was performed as a last resort after <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> was unable to deliver the 300-pound calf and her system did not abort the fetus. Veterinarians had feared that the elephant could die a slow, painful death if the decomposing fetus was not removed, park spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON> said. Park officials will keep <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> in isolation to make sure she does not contract infections or break her sutures. `` She was a little shaky, but she was a good patient during the anesthesia and she maintained herself very well, including body temperature and pulse,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Oosterhuis </PERSON>, the park's director of veterinary services who directed the procedure He said park officials believed it was the first Caesarean section ever performed on an elephant. `` It was very stressful. It was a big procedure and it took a lot of effort,'' he said. `` There's a good possibility that she will not be able to breed again and even if she were able to, we might not want to try to breed her to avoid problems that could occur from this procedure.'' The equine surgeons were brought in because of their work with horses, whose anatomy resembles that of an elephant, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. After weeks of tests, veterinarians confirmed on Saturday that <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> was carrying a fetus that died sometime in September. The elephant was under general anesthesia for the operation. After the operation was completed, veterinarians administered a drug to counteract the anesthesia. Five minutes later, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> stood up on her feet, to the cheer of the surgical team and other park employees. `` We are relieved and quite pleased that she even made it through today's procedure,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Basque separatists taking seats in Parliament for the first time boycotted its opening ceremonies today hours after being attacked by masked gunmen, who killed one deputy and badly wounded another. Both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> condemned the assassination of deputy-elect <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> `` Josu'' <PERSON> Muguruza </PERSON>, 31, of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> party. He was pronounced dead on arrival Monday night at <LOCATION> Gregorio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maranon </LOCATION> hospital after being shot once in the head while dining in a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> restaurant. The second deputy, 41-year-old <PERSON> Inaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Esnaola </PERSON>, was in very serious condition after six hours of surgery, according to a hospital statement. They said <PERSON> Muguruza </PERSON> and Esnaola were with the five other Basque parliamentarians and three journalists at a table when the gunmen attacked. No one claimed responsibility for the attack. The Popular Union issued a statement blaming the `` Spanish state apparatus'' and right-wing terrorists. It called for a general strike Wednesday in the three-province Basque region to protest the killings. Popular Union spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Idigoras </PERSON> said the party's two other deputies and three senators had decided to boycott today's ceremonies, which they believed should have been canceled following the assassination But he told reporters that his party, generally considered the political wing of the armed separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, would still participate in Parliament for the first time since <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s return to democracy in 1977. `` If they think they're going to intimidate us ... they're wrong,'' <PERSON> Idigoras </PERSON> said The politicians were all elected in Oct. 29 voting. <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Xabier </PERSON> <PERSON> Oleaga </PERSON> said on Saturday that the party <PERSON> Batasuna </PERSON> had decided to take its seats because it believed there would be new peace negotiations between the government and ETA. He said the party wants to be present in Parliament to present its side of the issues. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, whose initials stand for Homeland and <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> in the Basque language, has claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed more than 600 people. It began its violent campaign for independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1968. Monday's shooting drew condemnation from all major political parties and the Socialist-led government. Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the attack was `` as horrendous as all terrorist acts ... and without doubt an attack against the pacification process'' in the Basque region. Government spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Conde </PERSON> called it an attack against democracy and said `` the full weight of the law will fall on those responsible.'' Anonymous callers to several radio stations in the Basque region said today that the attack had been carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Terrorist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groups </ORGANIZATION>, a shadowy organization that some people link to the police. In the hours after the attack, police in the Basque region reported several incidents, including the explosion of a small bomb outside a branch office of the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bilbao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vizcaya </ORGANIZATION> bank in the town of <LOCATION> Santurce </LOCATION>. The bomb damaged a car but caused no injuries, they said. Molotov cocktails started fires at a train station in the town of <PERSON> Villabona </PERSON> and a bank in Onate, police said. The head of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Aznar </PERSON>, told reporters he deplored the attack. But he added that the Basque party's outrage seemed hollow since it had never condemned the deaths of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>'s victims. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the death of an army lieutenant colonel gunned down in a car in downtown <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> last week. He was the 17th victim of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> violence this year. The <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> government began exploratory peace talks with exiled <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> earlier this year but canceled them in April when <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> terrorists renewed their attacks.

<HEAD>Commission Proposes Strict Ethics Code for L.A. Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A commission appointed by Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has proposed a tough ethics code he called a model for other cities. It would ban outside income for officials, limit campaign spending and require detailed financial disclosure. `` Government in this country and in this city is suffering from a crisis in confidence,'' panel member <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said Monday. `` There's a lack of confidence in the integrity of its process, its participants and its results.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s own problems with conflict-of-interest allegations led him to appoint the commission in April after he was elected to an unprecedented fifth term. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> would have been in violation of some provisions had the code been in effect, panel members said. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who would have to sign any ethics plan into law, backed the package approved unanimously Monday by the seven-member <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to Draft an Ethics Code for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Government. `` They have proposed an ethics code that will pave the way for other cities across the nation to follow our lead,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said in a statement. He promised to work for its passage by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Some of the proposals also must be approved by voters citywide because they would change the City Charter. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>, who heads a council committee considering ethics reforms, said most recommendations will be approved in some form, but two _ a permanent ethics commission and public campaign financing _ have an uncertain future. Unlike some state and federal ethics measures, the proposed code contains no provision to increase pay to make up for its ban on outside earned income and its strict limits on gifts. `` We're convinced that the best way to attract good people to government is it assure that the government itself will be highly ethical and that they will be working for an institution that is worthy of public respect,'' said commission Chairman <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>. It is the panel's proposed ban on outside income for elected city officials and top decision-makers that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> would have violated, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said. The mayor accepted consulting fees from two banks that do business in the city. There were suggestions he appointed the ethics panel to save face, but the commission soon declared its independence from the mayor by obtaining private funding. The commission recommended that elected officials and top appointed officials disclose in detail information about all income and investments, including their primary home and investments outside the city. The panel also called for giving the city attorney additional enforcement powers and appointing a special prosecutor in some cases. The city attorney concluded an investigation in September by filing civil charges against <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> on allegations the mayor improperly reported some securities holdings. The mayor still is under state and federal investigation.

<TEXT>
 Helicopters sprayed the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> against Medflies overnight as agriculture officials lamented a new infestation threatening fruit crops elsewhere in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` The situation is grave,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, the leading entomologist on the state's <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> fruit fly advisory panel. `` Nobody wants more spraying, but we have to face the fact that this is our fallback.'' Early today, helicopters completed spraying the pesticide malathion over the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> communities of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Studio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, crisscrossing a 12-square-mile section in an effort to eradicate the Medfly, which ruins fruit and vegetables. Before the aerial attack began late Monday, about 15 environmentalists lined up along <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> encouraging drivers to honk if they were against the spraying. `` he purpose of the protest is to increase pressure on public officials to ban malathion,'' said demonstrator <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Toller </PERSON>. The discovery Monday of a pregnant Medfly in <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, about 25 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, prompted state officials to order spraying next week in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to protect its $ 225 million citrus and nursery industry. `` It is a tremendous threat to our industry, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're sensitive to public concern, but the Medfly does need to be eradicated. In the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, residents were warned to stay inside, keep pets indoors and cover their cars against the pesticide's sticky fly bait, which can harm automobile paint. Despite the warnings, officials maintain malathion poses no harm to people. Pesticides have been sprayed over more than 100 square miles in the four-month Medfly war in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The fight this year has cost taxpayers more than $ 10 million. Medflies threaten <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s $ 16 billion farm economy because they lay eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables, making them inedible.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawmakers Vote Down Government Plan for Limited Autonomy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet legislators rejected a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plan to allow limited local autonomy, with lawmakers complaining it would instead entrench central economic planning and worsen ethnic strife, official news reports said today. The Soviet legislature, which was reshaped over the past year, rejected the plan in a vote Monday. It has been taking an increasingly independent role from <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> directives. The government plan was presented to legislators by Deputy Premier <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s top economic adviser. It would govern relations between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and local authorities, primarily those in the 15 Soviet republics. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> called for a cautious approach to economic decentralization because of the country's difficult economic problems `` We are now making only the first steps on the path of the republics' economic independence,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` It is very important not to go to extremes, not to roll into a dangerous and unjustified separation, and at the same time make a decisive step from extreme centralization on the Union level.'' But Deputy V.I. <PERSON> Alksnis </PERSON> said the plan was aimed at shaping a single, federated government rather than a union of sovereign governments sought by the Baltic and other republics, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Any other variant will lead to an aggravation of inter-ethnic relations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Alksnis </PERSON> as saying. `` Rejecting the administrative-command style of managing the economy, we must recognize that a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureaucrat is no better than, for example, one from <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` Work collectives must at last gain the right of full independence from the central as well as the local apparatus.'' The Supreme Soviet on Monday also imposed price controls on several basic consumer goods, including some foods and clothes, and export controls on scare items like furs, electrical appliances, and fish products. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the deputies imposed the price controls to help retirees and other low-income groups hard hit by price increases and shortages of consumer goods.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Political leaders agreed today on a short-term government of the country's widely divided major parties, ending a stalemate produced by inconclusive elections this month. `` The three parties agreed to support a government whose life-term will last until mid-April,'' conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> told a news conference. The decision to hold general elections in April follows four rounds of talks between President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> and conservative, socialist and Communist leaders. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said the interim administration will be headed by a respected former <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> Xenophon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON>, who is not a member of Parliament. The government will include members of all parties and also non-political personalities, <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said. He added that the details of the Cabinet's make-up still have to be decided. He said the administration will tackle pressing economic problems and negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on whether to renew an agreement for their bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party, which in the Nov. 5 elections came just short of winning the parliamentary majority needed to form a government alone. He has since failed to find a coalition partner in either <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, the former Socialist premier, or Communist leader <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>. In the balloting, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> took 148 seats in the 300-member Parliament. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> won 128 and the Communist coalition garnered 21. On June 18, elections also failed to produce a winner. A conservative-communist government led the country until the November elections. The talks between the party leaders had been deadlocked until today over a demand by former socialist Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> that the electoral system be changed before his <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> supported any government. His proposed change to simple proportional representation would have made it even harder for any party to win a majority in the 300-member unicameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Under the present system, a party that receives at least 47 percent of the vote can govern alone. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> rejected the condition. He said party leaders had agreed that the April elections would be conducted with the existing electoral system.

 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> has cited the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for leaving unexploded bombs on public land outside target ranges. Environmental Protection chief <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodgion </PERSON>, who issued the order Monday against the <ORGANIZATION> Fallon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, said he has not decided whether to seek fines, which could run as high as $ 10,000 per day per violation. Some of the bombs may have been dropped as long as 30 years ago. No injuries have been reported. Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> commander, said some of the bombs and rockets may have landed outside the fenced ranges because of inexperienced pilots. Other bombs may have skipped across the desert floor for miles before coming to rest on federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> land outside the ranges, he said. The alleged violations of state law include a failure to notify the state and failure to get a state-approved plan to deal with the situation. `` The order requires them to cease and desist if they are n't complying with state laws, and to give us some background on when they discovered this problem,'' <PERSON> Dodgion </PERSON> said Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> expressed outrage last week that the the bombs were on public grazing lands for year but there was no effort made to remove them until recently. <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> has started a cleanup of bombs and bomb fragments near one practice range, but not two other ranges used by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilots. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> has closed lands it holds around the ranges pending inspections. <PERSON> Dodgion </PERSON> said his order wo n't stop the cleanup already under way. Some of the ordnance, being cleaned up in an exercise nicknamed Operation Ugly Baby, was found more than a mile outside one bombing range near <LOCATION> Fallon </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is studying suggestions for `` revolutionary changes'' in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s military _ including cutting 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers, getting rid of 100 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and closing at least a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources say. Amid the long-range budget planning, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday that <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also is considering a budget plan for the 1991 fiscal year that could cut $ 20 billion from the projected $ 317 billion spending level. `` It could be that bad,'' the official said. `` It could be that we have to cut that much.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> planned to hold a second day of meetings today with <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> chiefs to pore over proposed wide-ranging cutbacks for 1992 to 1994, which some <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> insiders say could be the most sweeping since the end of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. While much of the activity is driven by hints of change in the Soviet threat, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> also is trying to get ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in planning for the nearly inevitable budget squeeze, officials say. `` Mr. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has no intention of going up to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and having his budget thrown back in his face,'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Monday. `` This is going to be a very painful process for everyone.'' Some congressional sources, however, said they are wary about the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> projections of major force cuts, suggesting the numbers may be overstated to grab the limelight from lawmakers who have been warning the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its belt. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> expects to submit its 1991 spending projection to the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> by Dec. 8, the official said. Last week, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> ordered the military chiefs of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to produce `` worst-case'' budget cuts designed to slash projected spending, including earlier-anticipated increases, by $ 180 billion over the three-year period from fiscal 1992 through 1994. `` These are revolutionary changes,'' said one knowledgeable military source. `` Mr. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is really trying to shake the service chiefs out. He wants their backs pressed to the wall, telling him exactly what it is they can give up. He wants their grimmest scenarios.'' The Army has told <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> it could cut, over a five-year period, as many as 100,000 soldiers, which could translate into `` at least several divisions,'' said one Pentagon official. `` We're mostly people. The other forces can cut their expensive weapons, but our money is in our folks,'' the officials said. `` We'd like to make sure that if we have to have fewer units, we want to have the best we can get.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has said its `` worst case'' could envision a cut of up to 100 ships _ bringing the number down to 466 and dashing the dreams of the previous administration's 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> source said. Other proposals include mothballing the service's four World War II-era battleships; cutting the number of aircraft carriers from the current 15 to 10 or 12; and getting rid of 20 to 30 flight squadrons, the source said. Another Pentagon official said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has suggested cutting at least 12 bases, stretching out purchases of the B-2 stealth bomber and eliminating five fighter wings. The review also will require the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to take another look at its proposal for two new mobile missiles _ the rail-based MX and the smaller, truck-based Midgetman, the source said. On Monday, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> held more than four hours of conferences with his civilian advisors, the military chiefs of staff and <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> to review the military's suggestions <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had not made any decisions about the reported suggestions. He called the activity a `` budget exercise'' designed to force the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to respond to the changes occurring under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the budget pressures of the nation's deficit. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it was clear to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> leadership that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s earlier projections for 1 percent spending increases for fiscal 1991 and 1992, followed by 2 percent increases in 1993 and 1994, are n't realistic anymore.

<HEAD>Top Economists Meet; Government Says Economy Collapsing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top economists today began debating the pro-market economic program of the Solidarity-led government, which described the Polish economy as on the brink of collapse. More than 400 economists representing the 55,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> convened for a two-day meeting in the city of <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The building, energy and agriculture sectors are among those reporting a drop in production, according to economic indicators for October released Monday by the main statistical office, known by its Polish initials GUS. A total of 5,500 apartment buildings were completed in October, 15.7 percent less than in October 1988, the government said. Between January and October of this year 65,200 apartments were made available to the public, 18.2 percent less than last year. Poles sometimes have to wait more than 20 years for apartments. A chronic housing shortage was a major public grievance against the Communist regime, which lost control of the government in August after more than 40 years in power. With winter approaching, production in the fuel and power industry was down 1.6 percent and coal production was down 10.7 percent from the same period in 1988, the report said. The October inflation rate was put at 54.8 percent. The annual inflation rate is now estimated at over 700 percent. The Cabinet met until late Monday night to continue work on the 1990 budget following a visit by the representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in October, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Its prognosis was grim. `` At present <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy is on the brink of collapse. This state, as well as the experience of other countries, exclude the possibility of gradual overcoming of such a profound crisis,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said in a report on the Cabinet meeting. Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the former Solidarity editor who became the first non-Communist prime minister in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc on Aug. 24, already has appealed to coal miners to work Saturdays to make up for shortfalls in coal production. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that miners had responded to the appeal and extracted 116,000 more tons of coal last Saturday than on an average Saturday for the last three months. A commentary in the pro-Solidarity daily <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> today criticized the economic program, saying its goals exceeded the government's means. `` The government program sounds innovative for it uses formulations from the arsenal of a market economy. Only it is not possible to implement it for the goals it outlines do not correspond to the instruments,'' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> has stressed the need for quick implementation of the reforms, but the government is learning that it takes time to pass legislation and to reverse over 40 years of bureaucratic practices. The economic plan was announced in early October. It calls for taking steps to change the principles of ownership, changing the banking system and making state enterprises more efficient. It also envisages a social security system to protect workers during the period of economic restructuring.

<HEAD>Expert Says Drugs in Motorcyclist's Blood Would Not Make Him Agressive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Drugs found in the bloodstream of a black motorcyclist shot to death by a policeman would not have caused him to attack the officer, an expert for the prosecution testified. Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moskowitz </PERSON>, an expert on drug-induced behavior, said Monday that the high amounts of THC _ the active ingredient in marijuana _ in the bloodstream of <ORGANIZATION> Clement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> would have tended to make him `` more mellow.'' <PERSON> Moskowitz </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, also said that the small amounts of alcohol and cocaine that he had ingested would not have significantly affected his driving or his behavior. The defense for Colombian-born Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> claims <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, aimed his motorcycle at the officer while fleeing from a squad car and that <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot him in self-defense. The Jan. 16 shooting set off three days of riots. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, died in the subsequent crash and <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, was charged with two counts of manslaughter. In earlier testimony Monday, associate medical examiner <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said the levels of THC in <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION>'s bloodstream were among the highest on record at the medical examiner's office. He also said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> had a moderate amount of alcohol in his blood and small traces of cocaine in his nose. Using the head of a mannequin, <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> traced the path of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s bullet from the left front temple to the rear of the head, saying it appeared the officer was to the side of the motorcycle when the shot was fired. The prosecution contends that the motorcycle was not headed directly at <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> and that he fired unnecessarily. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> also testified that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was carrying 5.5 grams of marijuana and $ 1,500 in cash at the time. The rioting that followed the shooting left one person dead from gunfire, 11 people injured and 13 buildings burned down in black neighborhoods.

 Medals and memorabilia belonging to Olympic hero <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON>, whose story was told in the movie `` Chariots of Fire,'' fetched $ 39,720 at auction today. Egyptian-born entrepreneur <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Fayed </PERSON> bought some 30 of <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON>' medals, stopwatches he used during training and his Commander of the British Empire award bestowed by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in 1957, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auctioneers said.

He was the first and only Englishman to win the Olympic 100 meters, and gave up athletics after a fall in a long jump competition in 1925.

<TEXT>
 Hepatitis B, a blood-borne disease that can cause fatal liver cancer, is a much greater worldwide health threat than AIDS, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doctors are doing little to promote use of a vaccine against the illness, an infectious disease expert says. There are 20 to 30 times more carriers of the hepatitis B virus than there are people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS, Dr. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infectious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` Hepatitis B is the most important blood-borne disease in the world today, and that includes AIDS,'' <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON> said in an interview at the fourth National Forum on AIDS and Hepatitis B. `` There are almost 300 million carriers of the hepatitis B virus in the world today and there are about 10 to 15 million carriers of the HIV virus.'' Among carriers of the hepatitis B virus, 25 percent, or about 60 million, will die from primary liver cancer, he said. An additional 15 percent, or about 45 million, will die of cirrhosis, another liver disease. `` Hepatitis B is as great a threat to the health of Americans as AIDS,'' <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON> said. `` There are about 300,000 new infections of hepatitis B annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' About 30,000 of those newly infected will become carriers who can spread the disease, and about one-fourth of this number eventually will die of cirrhosis or liver cancer, he said. The exact number of Americans who die annually from primary liver cancer caused by hepatitis B is not known because records on liver cancer deaths do not reflect if the cancer originated in the liver or moved there from another site. However, controlled studies have shown that one-fourth of all hepatitis B virus carriers will develop primary liver cancer or cirrhosis at some point in their lives. As of Sept. 30, there have been 109,167 reported cases of AIDS, with 64,849 deaths, since June 1, 1981. In a keynote address to the conference, Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Americans need to take hepatitis B as seriously as they do HIV infection.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that even though a vaccine is available to protect against hepatitis B, the therapy is not widely used. `` Even health care workers, who should know better, have a problem taking hepatitis B seriously,'' he said. `` A <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> survey of hospitals with vaccination programs found that only 36 percent of health care workers have received the vaccination.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said 10,000 to 12,000 health care workers contract hepatitis B annually while caring for patients, and <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON> said about 300 of those infected health care workers die annually of liver-related illnesses. `` A health care worker dies virtually every day because they were n't inoculated against this disease,'' he said. <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON> said that there are 26 known cases of health care workers becoming infected with the AIDS virus on the job. Both the hepatitis B virus and the AIDS virus are spread through contact with infected blood, through sexual intercourse and through sharing of needles among intravenous drug users. Both viruses also are spread from birthing mother to newborn. <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON> said a health care worker who receives an accidental needle prick while treating patients infected with hepatitis B has a 40 percent chance of becoming infected. The threat of contracting AIDS from a needle prick is only about 0.5 percent, he said. Most people infected with hepatitis B suffer mild symptoms and then recover, but about 10 percent become carriers of the virus and a fourth of these eventually will develop liver cancer or cirrhosis. Despite the known dangers of the disease, <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON> said only 24 percent of all doctors have bothered to get the hepatitis B vaccine. `` It is absurd how underutilized this vaccine is,'' said <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON>. He said the vaccine, developed through gene manipulation techniques and available since 1982, `` is the safest and most effective vaccine in the world.'' Hepatitis B is most common in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and some countries there now require routine inoculations against the disease. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has recommended the hepatitis B vaccine be part of routine childhood vaccination programs, but <PERSON> Kuvin </PERSON> said no legislative body in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has proposed such a program for Americans. `` This is the first time in American history that a vaccine has been developed that did not produce a reduction in disease,'' said the physician. `` This is a national tragedy in incubation.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> crews made up for lost time today as they worked under a tight timetable for launching space shuttle Discovery on a fiery nighttime flight Wednesday with five astronauts and a spy satellite. `` They're making headway and expect to be caught up by tonight. We're on schedule for Wednesday night,'' space agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> reported today. Forecasters said the weather outlook was 80 percent favorable but that an advancing cold front would drop the odds to 40 percent if the launch were postponed to Thursday, Thanksgiving. Workers had fallen behind in checking out systems and putting the two solid fuel booster rockets back together. They had been opened last week so technicians could inspect computer boxes for faulty wiring. One box was replaced. Because the mission is secret, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said only that liftoff is scheduled between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. and that the agency will make the countdown public just nine minutes before liftoff. The launch is expected to take place about 7:30 p.m. There also will be a news blackout throughout the mission. It will be only the third after-dark launch in 32 shuttle missions. The last one, in November 1985, was visible for the 700 miles from <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C. This is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said the secrecy makes it more difficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> to track the shuttle. The astronauts assigned to the mission slept during daylight hours Monday to adjust their schedule to the hours they will keep in space because of the nighttime launch. At night, the commander, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, and the pilot <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, practiced night landings on the shuttle runway here in a jet equipped to handle like a shuttle. Disovery is scheduled to land at night at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after a flight expected to last four days. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> also would have to land the shuttle in the dark here or at emergency runways in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in case of an abort after liftoff. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, who flew on a 1985 shuttle mission, is the first black to command a shuttle mission. The other crew members are <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, all mission specialists.

 The chief public prosecutor today said he will not appeal the acquittal of a man in the slaying of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>. The prosecutor, <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonsson </PERSON>, said it was unrealistic to believe the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would overturn the Nov. 2 decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Svea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> reported.

A district court in July convicted <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> and sentenced him to life imprisonment, largely based on Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s identification The appellate court later ruled that Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s testimony left too much room for uncertainty. The appellate court, however, said that <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> had no alibi and that he was most likely the man seen waiting for Palme outside the movie theater. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 42, was previously convicted of several lesser crimes, including manslaughter.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s newly elected assembly broke into applause today at its opening session when the dominant party proposed democratic principles as guidelines for the territory's government The assembly is working on a constitution that will cement the territory's independence after 74 years of South African rule. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which waged a 23-year war against South African rule, won 41 of the 72 seats in elections earlier this month. However, the constitution must be approved by at least 48, or two-thirds, of the members. The 72 assembly members gathered at the <LOCATION> Tintenpalast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s seat of government since it was built by German colonial rulers in 1910 <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>, foreign affairs secretary for <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, proposed that: the constitution be the supreme law of the land;, the government consist of an elected executive responsible to the legislative branch and an independent judicial branch; a declaration of fundamental rights be written including freedom of movement, speech and a free press. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has been known as Marxist throughout most of its history, and its stand has been vague and contradictory regarding the democratic principles outlined in a 1982 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> document calling for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence. <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>'s proposal was unanimously applauded but could not be adopted because the constitutional assembly does not yet have rules of order. The assembly was adjourned until next week. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multi-racial coalition that favors a capitalist economy for predominantly black <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, has 21 seats in the assembly. The remaining 10 are divided among five other parties. `` I'm here with great humility and pride,'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> told the assembly. `` Pride, because an occasion like this only happens once in a lifetime. Humility, because I, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, son of an ordinary citizen, have been honored to be part of the struggle that brought us here and to lead us to nationhood.'' <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> <PERSON> Geingob </PERSON>, who headed <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s election campaign, was elected chairman of the assembly. The initial sessions are expected to focus on setting ground rules for writing the constitution. The parties have said they hope the document will be completed by early next year and independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can be declared shortly afterward. <PERSON> Marrti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisarri </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team monitoring the transition to independence, was present at the opening of the assembly. He has said he expects <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, to become independent before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to depart at the end of March. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1915 and gained a League of Nations mandate to administer the territory. The League's successor, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, revoked the mandate in 1966, and <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> launched its bush war <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed last year to allow independence under a U.S.-mediated peace accord that also calls for a phased withdrawal of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 50,000 troops from Marxist-ruled <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor

 <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s lawyers have reached an agreement with prosecutors that calls for the arms dealer to plead guilty today to a misdemeanor for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, sources said. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, who helped broker the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to his native <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as part of then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s efforts to free American hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, is scheduled to enter the plea in federal court, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the sources stressed that the deal was not final until <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> actually appeared in court and entered the plea before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. A previous court appearance was abruptly canceled recently when <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> backed out, the sources said. The exact terms of the plea agreement could not be obtained but sources said <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> had agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, declined to comment. Lawyers for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, filed court papers today indicating they were studying the possibility of resisting a subpoena for the former president to produce documents and testify at the Iran-Contra trial of former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The subpoena `` raises novel and complex constitutional issues,'' the former president's lawyers said in seeking a two-week delay in producing notes and papers sought by the subpoena. `` These issues relate to the scope of the executive privilege, the power of the court to compel a former president to testify in open court, and the threshold requirements necessary to support a subpoena ... against a former president,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. In the <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> case, it was expected that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> would drop major charges of conspiracy, theft and wire fraud stemming from the arms dealer's involvement in the diversion of weapons-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contras. Those charges were dropped against <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s other co-defendants after the government refused to release classified information necessary for trying those counts in open court. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> also was charged with conspiracy and offering an illegal gratuity to former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The charges stem from a $ 200,000 Swiss bank account that <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and his former business partner, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, allegedly set up for <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s family North, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide and retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer, was ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service for his Iran-Contra convictions. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general, pleaded guilty Nov. 9 to one count of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the televised hearings about the Iran-Contra affair. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also has asked for more time to comply with subpoenas for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> documents in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The government's pleadings indicated misgivings about the subpoenas seeking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s papers and testimony at <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to obstruct its inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked the court to delay until Dec. 6 the deadline to comply with subpoenas for records at the archives. The subpoenas are returnable on Wednesday. The department said it also sought a delay in the subpoena personally served on the former president, noting that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attorney would be filing a similar request <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Eramian </PERSON> said the archives needed more time to review more than 100,000 pages of documents. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also noted that `` depending upon their nature, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may wish to assert that certain requested documents must be protected from disclosure because of their privileged nature.'' `` However, even if some material is so privileged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may choose to make a discretionary release in any event if given time to consider the overall ramifications,'' the department said. The department noted that following the review of the documents, `` both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> must consider what if any position each is required to take considering the fact and scope of the live trial testimony sought of the former president.''

<TEXT>
 A pro-PLO activist says Palestinians have `` lost the initiative'' in the nearly two-year-old uprising and is proposing a new strategy based on creating a provisional government. <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibah </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that if `` positive energy'' were focused on building the institutions of Palestinian statehood, there would be less violence, both among Palestinians and with Israelis. `` I believe over the last few months we have lost the initiative and there has been a vacuum of strategy,'' he said. `` We have n't had any renewed strategic plan to put into the intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- `` In my opinion, these two things have helped in creating some of the disorders ... the friction and fighting and some tendencies towards violence.'' By focusing on building infrastructure for the state, he said, `` you get rid of the diversions of energy that have taken place over the past few months.'' The remarks, unusually candid for a senior <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists, in part appeared to grow out of rising frustration over the killing or intimidation of Palestinians by other Palestinians. According to army figures released this week, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists have carried out 670 attacks this year against other Palestinians, most accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. By <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count, at least 147 Arabs have died in such attacks. Some 615 Palestinians have died in confrontations with soldiers. <PERSON> Nusseibah </PERSON> said the problem stemmed largely from a lack of overall coordination among local groups that had sprung up during the intefadeh which he said led to confusion and unauthorized initiatives. `` Our idea is to unite them in a single policy and seek to implement it,'' he said. As a result, he said little headway in achieving statehood had been made since the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> in November 1988 and declared an independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A philosphy professor at <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nusseibah </PERSON> has been described in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court documents as closely associated with the pro-PLO underground directing the uprising against Israeli rule. His Holy Land Press Service was closed over the summer after authorities said it was an intefadeh planning center, and he was accused of acting as a conduit for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> funds. He said that in the wake of last year's <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration of an independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied lands, `` we should have moved, in my opinion, one step further in the direction of state creation. We did n't do that.'' <PERSON> Nusseibah </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-member executive committee, for example, should be transformed into a Cabinet, parceling out responsibilities such as health services, education and information. Palestinian officials in exile and those in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would report to the same `` minister,'' thus alleviating some of the confusion about lines of authority. He suggested Palestinians now serving in the Israeli-run military government of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> could be named as officials of a Palestinian government. Such officials have been urged to resign by underground leaflets that have labeled them collaborations. In the past, the concept of a provisional <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> government has been proposed as a vehicle for negotiations, one that could get around <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s objections to talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nusseibah </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> might `` wither away'' in its present form if the infrastructure of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is created, allowing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to become part of the government. `` I think that people have come to realize here that a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is not going to arrive in a wrapped package ... sent by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` They have to create it.''

 Schoolchildren clasping their parents' hands returned to class today for the first time since a tornado killed seven classmates in the cafeteria Flowers were piled high outside the cafeteria wall, but with a stiff wind whipping the American flag on its flagpole nearby, few people paused at the boarded-up wall at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coldenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Children riding school buses waved and smiled as they passed reporters and police clustered at the end of the driveway to the 270-student school. Reporters were kept away from the school, and school officials had no comment. Seven 7 - and 8-year-olds were killed and 18 others injured last Thursday when a tornado slammed into the cafeteria wall, raining glass and concrete on students having lunch Dozens of pupils visited the damaged cafeteria on Monday. Though students and their parents were encouraged to look at the cafeteria, they wo n't eat lunch there any time soon, <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. The cafeteria carries the spray-painted epitaph: `` Pray for the Children.'' More than 20 counselors were on hand Monday and were to return today. In some ways, the hardest task was reassuring parents, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. `` Students are very resilient,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. `` They get back very quickly. But parents _ dealing with the fears and traumas. ` How do I send my kid back into the cafeteria?' I can reassure parents now that they will never go back into that cafeteria in its present form.'' Funerals were held Monday for five young victims and two were held Saturday. Eleven of the 18 injured children remained hospitalized, two in critical condition. Compounding the tragedy, a 5-year-old East Coldenham pupil, <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sbordone </PERSON>, died Monday from injuries suffered in a car accident the day before. The accident happened only a few hundred yards from the school, but was unrelated to the steady stream of mourners there, police said. At the school, <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressel </PERSON> choked back sobs while leaving with her 10-year-old son, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, who was n't hurt. `` What amazes me are some of the parents of the children that died are in there today,'' <PERSON> Pressel </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think I could handle that. If I had a child that I lost in that school, I would n't want to go back in there.'' <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> said he `` felt sort of regular'' coming back to the school for the first time since the tornado. `` All I felt was a little sadness,'' he said. `` It helped me a little.'' Parents leaving the school stopped their cars to watch the funeral procession for 8-year-old <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumer </PERSON> pass. Rooms at the reopened school were set aside for adults and children to slip off to if they become upset, said <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Graefe </PERSON>, director of personnel for the Valley Central School District. It will cost nearly $ 400,000 to rebuild the cafeteria wall, but school Superintendent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonan </PERSON> said he wants to make it look as different as possible, with less glass. `` We'll do anything to make it comfortable for the kids,'' he said. `` If we have to make like booths in <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, we will.''

 Talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on an exchange of visits by separated family members hit a snag today after the North insisted on showing a revolutionary opera by its leader on South Korean television. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegates from the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> agreed to continue discussions Monday on the proposed Dec. 8 family exchange, but the chances of an agreement appeared slim. `` The prospect of the family exchange is dark as long as the North Korean side sticks to its plan to show a revolutionary opera encouraging class struggle,'' said South Korean senior delegate Song Young-dae after eight hours of talks. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s chief delegate, <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> <PERSON> Su </PERSON>, urged <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to accept the revolutionary opera, saying `` all the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people want to see it.'' The opera is by North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. It glorifies him and his late mother, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> <PERSON> Suk </PERSON>. `` I do n't think it would be impossible to reach an agreement,'' <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> told reporters when asked about prospects for the talks, which reopened in September after a several-month stalemate. The delegates, meeting at this truce village inside the demilitarized zone, overcame one problem today when they agreed on the numbers: an exchange of 571-member delegations, for a period of four days starting Dec. 8. They also agreed that each side would determine the composition of its own delegation, which would be comprised of separated family members, entertainers, support personnel and reporters. But the two sides could not agree on terms for their entertainers to perform live on television. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded four segments of air time, each lasting at least three hours, during the four-day exchange. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, revising its original proposal, offered to allow three performances of 2 -LCB- hours each. North Korean delegates insisted their entertainers needed at least three hours to present the opera. South Korean officials denounced <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, saying it was injecting political propaganda into the humanitarian project, and strongly indicated that <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> would not accept the showing of the opera. There are about 10 million separated family members in the two Koreas, which were divided by the partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in 1945 and the Korean War in 1950-53. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> talks are one of several channels of dialogue under way to help ease tension on the peninsula. Talks on sports, political and parliamentary contacts also have made little progress.

<HEAD>Government Seeks to Force Firms to Disclose Cash-Paying Clients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government has gone to court in an unprecedented attempt to force two criminal-law firms to disclose the names of clients who paid them in cash. The action filed in federal court Friday was the first attempt to enforce <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> demands for the information from lawyers nationwide. A 1984 federal law aimed at money laundering requires reporting of cash transactions of $ 10,000 or more. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the legal action Monday. Both law firms involved in the case _ <ORGANIZATION> Fischetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pomerantz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Goldberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON> _ have represented alleged mob figures and drug suspects. They have refused to turn over the information, saying that it would violate the rights of their clients and the attorney-client privilege. Calls to the two firms were not returned today. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said the government was merely enforcing the law. `` The law is that information regarding fees and the identity of clients is not privileged,'' she said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> ordered the firms to appear in court Dec. 19 to explain why they should not be forced to provide the information. If they fail to comply, they could face criminal penalties including prison terms and fines of as much as $ 500,000. The action is only the latest battle between the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and defense lawyers. Prosecutors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have sought to force lawyers to forfeit fees paid by defendants whose money allegedly came from crime.

 Television cameras focused on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> today to give Britons their first live screen view of the venerable, if sometimes raucous mother of parliaments. The first image they saw in the live broadcast was the gowned, bewigged speaker, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON>, bellowing `` Order! Order!'' to bring chattering, excited lawmakers into line for the TV debut of the Mother of Parliaments. The unelected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> has permitted television broadcasts of its proceedings since 1985, and <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s ceremonial opening of Parliament was seen nationwide earlier this morning. But the House of Commons, the often rowdy elected chamber down the hallway, resisted the cameras until now, sticking only with live radio broadcasts that began in 1978. Former Conservative Cabinet minister <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gow </PERSON> delivered the traditional message of thanks to the queen for outlining the government's legislative program earlier today in the House of Lords. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, leader of the opposition Laborites, then prepared to joust with each other about the contents of the queen's speech. Any other lawmaker could join in, providing he or she can catch the Speaker's eye by standing up and waving an order paper _ a printed copy of the day's agenda _ and be called. The chamber can be a noisy place with much booing and braying and it's <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON> who can be heard repeatedly shouting `` Order, order'' in a bid to restore calm at times of tension. But TV viewers are not going to see it all. To prevent anything unseemly being shown, such as campaign buttons, outrageous dress or bored legislators asleep on their green leather benches, the televisors have been ordered to show only the head and shoulders of whoever is speaking. `` I think it's terrible that head shots will only be used. I could be wearing a tutu, and nobody would notice,'' said <PERSON> Laborite </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. Debates in the 650-member chamber go on for hours and hours, sometimes all night. Eight remote control cameras have been installed in the ornate chamber. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s four national channels and the Sky satellite network will be able to broadcast as much as they like of the daily proceedings, live or recorded. C-SPAN, the American cable-satellite public affairs network, planned to offer portions of the debates to its subscribers. It has taken 30 years of debate to get cameras into the Commons. A 318-264 vote in February 1988 agreed to them for an experimental six months, although the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> _ where the peers, most of them hereditary, sit on scarlet benches _ have been on live TV since 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> has allowed television since 1979. The 21-month delay in getting the cameras into the Commons included the dispatch of a delegation to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to see how Parliament is televised there. `` Planning the invasion of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> in World War II took only 12 months,'' grumbled lawmaker <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>.

The partisan shouts and jeers of the Commons have made it a byword for unruly behavior. This week's comments in the media centered on whether the cameras will make the chamber better behaved _ or possibly worse. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper predicted Monday that the Commons was unlikely to beat the soap operas as a favorite with the public. `` But, at least, we may get an insight into why they make those peculiar noises we have heard for so long on the Commons sound broadcasts,'' it said.

<TEXT>
 The Nicaraguan government, seeking a cease-fire agreement, today dropped its demand for a total withdrawal of Contra rebels from Nicaraguan territory and called instead for a pull-back of 2,300 insurgents. Outlining the new proposal at a news conference, Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the figure represents the total number of Contras who have infiltrated into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in recent weeks. `` If the Contras do not accept the proposal, they have no interest in a cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. He spoke to reporters at the Nicaraguan Embassy shortly before the resumption of cease-fire talks with the Contras at the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Contras have insisted on a cease-fire in place and have said that there has been no significant increase in the number of rebels operating inside Nicaraguan territory in recent weeks. But <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said even the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged that about 2,000 Contras have crossed back across the border from the Honduran base camps since the first week of October. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suspended the cease-fire on Nov. 1 after alleging the Contra forces had engaged in terrorist activities. The chief Contra negotiator, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, has accused the Sandinistas of hardening their position by insisting on both the withdrawal of the Contras and their demobilization. But <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> misunderstood the Sandinista position. A commission made of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> mediators spent the weekend drawing up revisions of a plan they had set forth during the early going of the negotiations, which began Nov. 9. Part of Monday's negotiating session was spent going over the revisions. Before the talks resumed Monday, rebel spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> accused the Sandinistas of not negotiating in good faith. `` They want a total surrender,'' he said. `` They want an unconditional surrender.'' <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> called for an immediate cease-fire with appropriate verification procedures. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> reaffirmed his government's view that the cease-fire must be linked to a `` separation of forces'' _ meaning the withdrawal of Contra forces to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` That's fundamental,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> also disclosed he had a brief meeting with a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official Saturday to discuss issues relating to the staffing of the respective embassies of the two countries. He did n't identify the official with whom he spoke. The administration generally has avoided high-level contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, urging them instead to focus attention on resolving their differences with both the Contras and the internal opposition.

 Delegates to a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress today extolled hard-line leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and offered lavish praise for his rejection of democratic reform. Politburo member and labor leader <PERSON> Miu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrescu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s nearly six-hour speech to delegates Monday was `` an exemplary model of creative tackling of present-day realities, a genuine thesaurus of social and political thinking. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's fiercest hard-line leader, opened the party congress with a firm rejection of reforms sweeping the region. Instead, he declared his intention to increase government and party control of daily affairs. `` The ruling out of the capitalist system ... is the leading requirement of a just society,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> asserted to orchestrated displays of adulation from more than 3,000 delegates at downtown Palace Hall in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. He also called for the cancellation of the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939, under which <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> later annexed parts of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Romanian province of <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION> was annexed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a year later under the pact's secret protocol. It was the first time <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had mentioned the accord. `` A clear, unequivocal stand of condemnation and cancellation must be taken against all the accords concluded with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, practical conclusions being drawn to eliminate all the consequences of those accords and dictates, `` he said in his speech Romanian Communist leaders never reclaimed the province, now called Soviet <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. However, the party daily, <LOCATION> Scinteia </LOCATION>, for the first time published a story Nov. 14 describing recent popular unrest in <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, the republic's capital. The delegates' support underscored <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s tight control of the congress and the personality cult that has grown up around him during his 24 years in power. His comments were interrupted for up to 50 seconds by shouts of `` <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, Communism! <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, Heroism!'' and other slogans shouted in unison to the accompaniment of rhythmic clapping. The five-day congress is expected to approve <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s economic plan for the next five years The plan continues strong state control of the economy. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has invested billions of dollars in a crash industrialization program that led to widespread food and energy shortages for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s 23 million people. Yet the longer the food lines and the more vocal the people's complaints, the more harshly the regime has cracked down on critics During the congress, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> as well as relatives and supporters were expected to win re-election to the party leadership. Although a nominal ally, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for the first time sent no party delegation to the congress amid tensions over <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s rapid moves toward democracy and its accusations that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> mistreats its Hungarian minority. Also absent were all sixteen <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries except <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. In the past, Western ambassadors have attended the opening day of the congress. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement expressed the `` depths of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern over the human rights situation, for which the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is responsible.'' Other embassies also said they were protesting human rights violations. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has been targeted internationally for Draconian restrictions on its citizens. Romanians are forced to report contacts with foreigners, and they have severely limited political and religious freedoms.

 Four psychologists who speculated publicly about the reasons <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> became depressed and drank rubbing alcohol may face censure or have their licenses revoked by a state board, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychologists </ORGANIZATION>, appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, says the psychologists may have violated ethical principles in commenting on Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' condition in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. The Nov. 10 article suggested that the governor's wife broke down in part because she was carrying all the emotional burdens of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> marriage. If a complaint is filed as a result of a preliminary inquiry, which is under way, the psychologists could be censured or lose their licenses. The psychologists are <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dym </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kantor </PERSON>. The inquiry raises questions about professional ethics as well as free speech, said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a lawyer specializing in First Amendment cases. He said the board's actions give the appearance the state is trying to quash speculation about the governor's wife. `` In a situation like this, where the governor and his family are under intense public scrutiny, it's particularly important that state agencies not become involved in making any threats to those who have been a part of the process,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Executive Office of Consumer Affairs, which oversees the state's independent licensing boards, said the order initiating the inquiry did not come from the governor. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a board member, said the inquiry was prompted by the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> article, which appeared on the same day as a board meeting. After a `` full and lengthy discussion, there was a consensus'' to contact the psychologists about their comments, he said. He added it is the board's duty to make sure psychologists conduct themselves in a `` professionally responsible'' manner when commenting to the media. In letters to the psychologists, the board suggested they may have violated at least six of the board's ethical principles. Three of the four psychologists said they believed they were misquoted, misrepresented or quoted out of context in the Nov. 10 article but would not comment beyond that statement, The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> confirmed that she received a letter from the board but would not say whether she was quoted accurately. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvoy </PERSON>, managing editor of The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, said the newspaper stands by the article He also defended the practice of reporters asking experts about current events even though they are not directly involved. `` We report by analogy all the time,'' he said. `` If a major political figure has heart bypass surgery ... certainly a reasonable approach is to go to doctors and ask how the procedure works.''

 A former airline pilot was convicted today of murdering his wife and running the body through a wood chipper to get rid of the evidence. A Superior Court jury deliberated more than three days before finding <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crafts </ORGANIZATION> guilty in the 1986 slaying. The 51-year-old <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> man could receive up to 60 years in prison at sentencing Jan. 8. Crafts was accused of killing his Danish-born wife, <PERSON> Helle </PERSON>, in their bedroom, cutting up the body with a chainsaw and feeding parts through a rented wood chipping machine. Prosecutors were unable to establish the cause of death but said blood was spattered on the bedroom walls. Because Mrs. Crafts' body was never found, the prosecution faced a burden of proof unprecedented in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> _ proving that a woman had been murdered when the defense argued that she may still be alive, perhaps living in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The evidence included less than an ounce of human remains, such as a fingernail and hair that the prosecution claimed were Mrs. Crafts.' Witnesses included three Newtown-area residents who said they saw a man using a wood chipper on a bridge above the <LOCATION> Housatonic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Damaging testimony also came from Crafts' brother-in-law, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, who said Crafts told him police divers would not find his wife's remains in the river. According to <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, Crafts said, `` Let them dive. There's no body _ it's gone.'' The prosecution suggested Crafts acted out of anger that his wife, a 39-year-old flight attendant and mother of three, had asked for a divorce because her husband was seeing another woman. Crafts' first trial in 1988 ended in a mistrial when a juror walked out of deliberations after refusing to join in a guilty verdict.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 150,000 protesters filled central <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> today in the fifth day of anti-government demonstrations, and the Communist premier told opposition leaders he favors reforms. The state news agency said prosecutors have begun investigating police brutality at an anti-government rally on Friday in which hundreds of peaceful demonstrators were clubbed. And in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> backed the rapid changes encompassing <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including the demands for reform in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` I think the changes under way now are consistent with the overall context of the changing world,'' he said. Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said for the first time that Communist authorities were open to a dialogue with the opposition. He told a delegation including opposition members that the hard-line leadership was willing to hold a dialogue and did not rule out talking with members of Charter 77, Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s oldest human rights organization The premier also said he favored having non-Communists in government. The premier met with a 10-member delegation that included members of the newly formed Civic Forum opposition movement as well as representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> youth movement, the <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> state new agency reported. Members of the delegation quoted <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> as saying, `` the situation in the -LRB- state-controlled -RRB- mass media is intolerable,'' and that he was in favor of a `` different concept of the leading role of the party.'' They also quoted him as saying he favored `` having in the federal government people with no membership in a political party and members of other political parties and especially young people.'' A government spokesman, <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>, denied earlier reports that the group included <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a playwright and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident. There were no immediate details on the talks. Civic Forum, formed Sunday, is comprised of a dozen opposition groups. It has demanded the resignation of officials who carried out purges following the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 and those who ordered security forces to use violence to crush Friday's demonstrations. A Communist-allied Czechoslovak newspaper, <PERSON> Lidova </PERSON> <PERSON> Demokrace </PERSON>, published an opposition call for the ouster of top Communists, a demand of the estimated 200,000 people who marched through <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Monday with chants of `` Freedom!'' On Monday, the country's major state media also broke with past practice by providing extensive coverage of the march in the capital _ Communist <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s largest anti-government demonstration ever. The coverage indicated the party leadership was increasingly shifting to the East German approach of tolerating massive public protests. CTK announced that the general prosecutor of the Czech republic had opened an investigation into the actions of security forces Friday. Scores of demonstrators were beaten by riot police to break up an anti-government rally. Early today, posters condemning police brutality appeared on shop windows, office buildings and restaurants. The official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said about 200 to 300 young people held an all-night vigil in downtown <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where Monday's demonstration began. The pro-democracy tide now sweeping over one of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's last strongholds of hard-line communism also spread Monday to provincial cities, which saw their first big street demonstrations in decades So far, however, there has been no indication that workers have heeded student calls to join the strike. Protesters waved `` V'' for victory signs in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, where a government-sponsored reform movement was crushed by a Soviet-led invasin 21 years ago. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is now encouraging <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc allies to embrace popular demand for reforms. Student strike committee leaders said demonstrations would continue daily at least through this week. The announcement may have played a role in the sudden cancellation of a scheduled visit that was to have begun today by new East German leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who is under mounting popular pressure to resign. The newspaper of the Communist-allied <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lidova </PERSON> <PERSON> Demokrace </PERSON>, published a statement today from the Civic Forum opposition group that called for the resignation of <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and other top party officials. The move appeared to indicate that some partners in the Communist-dominated coalition are starting to distance themselves from their ruling allies. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> canceled a planned visit by <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON>, chief ideologist of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, because of the use of force against protesters. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc: In <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, delegates to a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress today extolled hard-line leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and offered lavish praise for his rejection of democratic reform. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's fiercest hard-line leader, condemned reforms taking place in neighboring nations Monday. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a state-run newspaper sharply criticized party chief <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> today, saying he has not won popular trust. Also, a West German newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> could be ousted as the nation's senior leader within four weeks. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> himself acknowledged in a nationally televised interview Sunday he could lose his power during a party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17.

 A friend of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, the driver blamed for the nation's deadliest alcohol-related accident, testified today he took away <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s keys because he had been drinking too much the night of the crash. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said he saw <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> twice that night and that they had discussed driving to <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> suburb. `` I thought he's been drinking and he does n't have no business being on the road,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` I planned to take him to <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, anyway, so I just took the keys.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, is charged with 27 counts of murder in the crash the night of May 14, 1988. His pickup truck was traveling the wrong way on an interstate near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> when it slammed into a bus, which exploded in flames. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s lawyers have contended that <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> never took <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s keys They have said that `` so-called friends'' of <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> gave him beer and liquor that night, although he was known to have a low tolerance for alcohol. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> conceded under cross-examination that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was not staggering or slurring his words and did not otherwise appear to be intoxicated. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> also had trouble recalling exactly when he took <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s keys. The first prosecution witnesses testified Monday that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was drinking the afternoon and evening of the crash _ the nation's second-deadliest school bus crash and the worst involving alleged drunken driving Two bartenders, a liquor store clerk and two of <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s friends testified that he drank at least five beers, but all said he did n't appear drunk <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s lawyers maintained in opening arguments Monday that he was n't solely responsible for the deaths of the 24 youngsters and three adults. They argued that unsafe design made the 1977 former school bus a death trap. It was a `` horrible tragedy, a senseless tragedy, one that did n't need to happen,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldani </PERSON>. `` The truth will lead you to a very simple conclusion: <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is not a murderer.'' The bus was taking 67 people home from an amusement park near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Most were members of a youth group at the First Assembly of God church in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>. `` Plain and simple, this is a murder case,'' Special Prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> told the jury. `` It's about who was involved and who was responsible. It's about the terrible cost of drunken driving.'' Jurors Monday were taken to the crash scene and to the warehouse where the wreckage of the bus and <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> pickup are being held as evidence. The courtroom was packed with relatives of the dead, many of whom were from military families. Some were outraged at the defense contention that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> does n't bear responsibility for the deaths, and they equated drinking and driving with premeditated murder. One was Army 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, whose wife and two daughters were killed. `` What's the difference if you murder somebody with an AK-47, a bomb or a steering wheel?'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> asked. `` It's obvious that he drove the vehicle, ... that he hit the bus, and there's 27 cemetery plots out there with 27 people in them.'' <PERSON> Mickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, whose 13-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON>, survived with burns, agreed: `` This was not an accident. This was a man who chose to drink, who chose to get in a car.'' Defense attorneys said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> will accept responsibility for the crash but not the deaths. They have contended that the bus, which was sold as school surplus, was a latent bomb because of a vulnerable fuel tank. They said the bus also lacked enough exits and that its 12-inch-wide aisle was too narrow for emergency escapes. The deaths were caused by smoke inhalation, authorities said. The prosecutor said he would prove <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> exhibited `` extreme indifference to the value of a human life'' when, driving north on I-71, he crossed the median and entered the southbound lanes. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> continued on for 2.3 miles, ignoring motorists' attempts to signal him, until plowing into the bus, <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said. In addition to the murder counts, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is charged with 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and one count of drunken driving.

 <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> foreign minister, today brought President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a piece of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall as well as the thanks of the German people for helping to bring the barrier down. `` I will treasure this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> as they posed for photographers at the outset of an Oval Office meeting. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> replied: `` It is an expression of the strength of freedom and democracy all over <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that our Germans ... were in a position, by peaceful means'' to open the wall. He said `` the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s formal name -RRB- is on the way really to become a democratic republic,'' although he added that this depends on free elections in the communist state in the year ahead. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> expressed `` our great gratitude for the support, the help and the firmness of the American nations in the past decades.'' `` It's the result of a very clear policy of the West advocating freedom and democracy all over the <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admired the nearly foot-long gray brick that the minister had given him. `` We will do nothing to undermine this process or even to weaken this process'' of reform throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. `` We do not look for advantage ... when they have to face difficulty.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, asked about modernizing nuclear forces in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said, `` I think this is a time to be discussed in'92 as was agreed in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> communique.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> had been pressing for talks to reduce short-range nuclear arms last spring before the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> rallied behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arms proposals. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> official told reporters after the meeting that he was impressed with the `` complete agreement'' he shared with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers on how to approach Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at this `` really historic moment'' of developing democracies. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said it was important that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and East European countries understand that the Western allies `` will do all we can to guarantee this stability'' and will do nothing from the outside to disturb the move to freer societies. The meeting with the West German minister came as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepares for next week's shipboard summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. The president will meet with another ally, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on Friday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won loud applause from audiences in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Monday when he promised to `` keep my eyes wide open'' and approach the talks with caution. `` I sometimes get needled a little about being cautious and prudent, but somehow I think that's what a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ought to do when you go to meet ... a Soviet leader,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Speaking today to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> and Land-Grant Colleges, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged college presidents to `` take a stand'' and tell their students `` that society will not tolerate the use of drugs.'' He appealed for help in drafting new national goals for education, and also urged the administrators to take to heart an admonition from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> that colleges must `` be much more selective about what we do'' to keep the costs of higher education within reasonable bounds. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent Monday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> to boost the fortunes of two pro-choice Republican congresswomen, Reps. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, who have their eyes on <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races next year. But immediately after singing <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s praises in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, he got aboard Air Force One and for a second time vetoed a District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> appropriations bill because of abortion funding provisions he found `` unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, who has not yet declared her candidacy for the seat now occupied by Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, was a guest on the presidential aircraft and she told reporters, `` I'm disappointed.'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and two other pro-choice <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congresswomen met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last Tuesday to, in <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s words, ask him to make clear there was room within the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> for abortion rights supporters. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said they asked him `` to find a way where he could still maintain the integrity of his own position on abortion without becoming involved in the minutiae of legislation, making determinations of who does what with the money when.'' `` Clearly he has sent that message by coming up to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on my behalf today,'' she said. But his second <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> appropriations veto _ his fourth abortion-related veto in recent weeks _ indicated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is adamantly opposed to any public funding for abortion, except to save the life of the mother. The District bill would have used federal Medicaid funds for abortions only in those circumstances, but would have allowed the district to pay for abortions on demand for poor women with local taxpayers' dollars. But under the district's home rule law, even its locally generated tax dollars are subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted no part of funding abortions `` with no restriction whatsoever.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had requested quick presidential action `` so <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could have time to act on it before the Thanksgiving recess.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> announced earlier that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will stay over in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> an extra day after the Dec. 2-3 meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to brief the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. At a fund-raising reception for <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> in a tent outside his <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, mansion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> predicted, `` It's going to be a historic meeting,'' but quickly added, `` I do n't want to see overpromises coming from it.'' But he said, `` We are living in times where the potential for peace and reduced tensions has never been better.''

<TEXT>
 The new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief criticized his predecessor, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, for siding with rioters during the pro-democracy protests and said `` international hostile forces'' will continue to try to thwart socialism. In remarks released Tuesday, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> also praised senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who recently retired from his last party post, and indicated <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> still plays a pivotal role in government. He also called for cooperation to strengthen the national economy and criticized corruption and a lack of discipline in the party. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> made his comments in a wide-ranging speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Nov. 9. The speech was carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and read on television. Neither gave a reason for the delay in reporting the speech. `` The struggle between international hostile forces and socialist countries will exist for a long time on the levels of infiltration and counterinfiltration, subversion and countersubversion,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said. He was referring to the Chinese army's bloody suppression in June of the pro-democracy movement, which the government calls `` counterrevolutionary turmoil'' and says was supported from overseas. `` Because of a rampant ideological trend favoring bourgeois liberalization -LRB- western ideals -RRB- for a period in the recent past, there was confusion about many theoretical issues,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said. `` Some cadres, including some leading officials, were affected by this to different degrees, and some even sided with the rioters,'' he said. He was clearly alluding to ousted party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who was dropped from all his party posts in June for supporting the student-led demonstrators and is believed to be under house arrest. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s removal led to <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s meteoric rise from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party boss to head the party at the last <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum in June. Earlier this month, he was named to head the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s handpicked successor. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, retired as head of the commission, his last party post. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, 62, urged patience in awaiting results from the ambitious market-oriented reforms started by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> a decade ago. While <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s reforms have raised the standard of living for millions of Chinese, increased production, and made more goods, many of them imported, available to consumers, a common complaint is that the reforms have not been benefited more people. But <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> gave high praise to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who despite his retirement remains the most powerful man in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. While the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> initially opposed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s desire to step down, `` a consensus of views is reached that <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is far-sighted, so we should respect his wishes and grant his request,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said. `` The health and longevity of Comrade <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> are of great significance to the smooth development of the work of the party and the state.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> mentioned democracy, but not in the context of political reforms. Party members and leaders, he said, `` must adhere to the principle of democracy, develop a democratic style of work, give heed to opinions from all walks of life, including different and even dissenting opinions.'' He also displayed an almost disarming modesty, saying he was not prepared to take the helm of the 47 million-member party in June. He lashed out at the bribery, embezzlement and other corruption that has become widespread, saying, `` We must rely on the masses to strengthen our efforts to construct clean politics, and fight against corruption and unhealthy tendencies in society and our party.'' He also said party discipline had become lax, encouraging `` selfish departmentalism and overstress on local interest.'' Party organizations in rural areas, he said, `` are in a state of weakness and slackness ... paralyzed or semi-paralyzed.''

 The House today voted for the third time to repeal catastrophic medical coverage for retirees, setting the scene for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to offer one last proposal to salvage some of the benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote was 352-63. Senators were preparing to send the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a compromise offer to kill the unpopular surtax that finances catastrophic benefits under the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> system and preserve some parts of the program. `` At this late date and hour, the only prudent action this House can take is force the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into voting for repeal,'' Rep. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., said as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> looked for a solution to one of the two major obstacles to adjournment for the year `` We are throwing out the baby with the bath water,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>. The program was enacted a year ago to prevent a major illness from plunging retirees into bankruptcy. Many of those retirees are objecting to having to pay for the program because they have private insurance coverage; some higher-income retirees do n't like having to pay an income surtax of up to $ 800 a year to finance the benefits. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders say the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will not adjourn for the year without repealing the surtax.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s senior advisers will recommend he sign a $ 14.6 billion foreign aid bill following an apparent truce on a provision that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> believed would reduce its flexibility in carrying out foreign policy, an administration official said today. The provision bars the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid money to entice foreign governments to carry out policies banned by American law. It grew out of the Iran-Contra affair, in which aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was expedited in return for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' agreement to shelter the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to the rebels. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., in a statement on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, said today that the provision refers only to clear written or oral agreements with other governments and `` is not an attempt to hamstring government officials in the course of their normal duties. The administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now was being advised to approve the measure. In another area of controversy within the bill, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected attempts to restrict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but there were signs that a week of heightened violence has left lawmakers wary of continuing what one called a `` blank-check'' policy. `` After 10 years of bankrolling failure, it is time we changed our policy,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore. `` Have we no right to ask why after almost $ 4 billion spent, after 70,000 lives lost, why our policy has not produced different results? Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday voted down efforts to curb the $ 85 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid due to flow to the government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> in the coming year, heeding a call by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to further weaken that country's new administration. After a debate that rekindled old animosities over <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 215 to 194 to effectively keep the restrictions from being added to the foreign aid bill, which contains money for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies around the globe and the first cash in a new aid program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. It sent the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which rejected a similar amendment by a 58-39 margin and forwarded the measure to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier in the day had termed any attempt to cut off aid to the <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government `` absolutely unacceptable,'' and added: `` This is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that is under attack ... It's totally unacceptable, and the day of these Marxist attacks should end right now.'' But the past week's violence in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> appeared to have created a shift of roughly 20 votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since the body voted 82-18 Sept. 20 for military aid with no conditions. And the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> followed its rejection of strings on the military aid with nearly unanimous approval of a resolution warning that future aid would hinge on whether <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> tracks down and puts on trial those responsible for the murder last week of six Jesuit priests and two apparent witnesses to the killings. The vote was 409-3. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., said lawmakers were coming under heavy pressure from Christian groups to take action against <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, including heavy lobbying and demonstrations at some members' district offices In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> expressed support for proposals `` to withhold substantial portions of military aid while the performance of the Salvadoran government and military is tested.'' And opponents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid heckled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during an appearance in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, while others in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> repeatedly interrupted <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor proceedings and were forcibly ejected from the chamber by Capitol police. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a pitched weeklong battle that has cost more than 1,000 lives was winding down as the leftist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> withdrew from the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> into the countryside. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., had proposed to add language that would have held back 30 percent of this fiscal year's military money until after April 1 of next year to keep pressure on the Salvadoran government to solve the Jesuit A similar proposal in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, pushed by Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., would have withheld 30 percent of the military aid until the killers of the priests were apprehended and brought to trial But Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., called it `` a terrible amendment,'' and added: `` If we pass it, we reward the communist terrorists ... and punish the democratically elected government. `` To rush into this breech with this kind of amendment is suicide, gentlemen, for that country,'' argued Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` This amendment is a selective response to a great tragedy.'' `` This is not a debate over who are the good guys and who are the bad guys,'' countered Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., `` This is a debate over whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an obligation to assure that taxpayer dollars are going to a government that protects human rights. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had personally told <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> `` how strongly we feel about the killings.'' `` And I told him that they must get to the bottom of it. I am convinced they will. The people who did this, whether they come from the extreme left or the extreme right, pay the penalty,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Major aid items included in the bill were $ 3 billion for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, $ 2.1 billion for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, $ 500 million for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, $ 300 million for <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, $ 440 million for the four Central American democracies, $ 533 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, $ 125 million for the drug war in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and $ 160 million for a new international development initiative for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

 The government on Tuesday announced plans to more carefully review cases in which severely disabled children have been denied Supplemental Security Income benefits. The new procedures were announced by <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> after a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> found that some eligible children had been improperly denied SSI benefits.

Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the new steps were taken after a review of 927 cases in which children were denied disability benefits found that 59 youngsters had been improperly turned down. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the overall error rate was not statistically significant, but that certain categories of youngsters were particularly prone to error, such as those under age 3 and those suffering from congenital, cardiovascular, digestive or mental disabilities. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> directed Social Security officials to do the following: _ Review all cases of disabled children from birth through age 3 twice before a claim is denied, and conduct double reviews for older children in certain categories prone to error _ Hire more pediatricians to help judge and review childhood claims since they are expert in the growth and development of children _ Review and revise the medical criteria used to determine which chidren are eligible for SSI benefits _ Intensify training and education of all disability examiners and medical personnel to improve their understanding of childhood disabilities

 A state-run newspaper today sharply criticized <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, saying he has not won popular trust. Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> meanwhile it is about to impose `` unpopular measures'' aimed at curbing black-market currency trading that has flourished since the lifting of travel restrictions on Nov. 9. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s statement, as reported by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, left unclear whether the leadership will try to cut down on the number of East Germans who can travel to the West. More than 6 million visitors have already reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> could be ousted as the nation's top leader within four weeks. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> himself acknowledged in a television interview Sunday he could lose his power during a party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17. On Monday, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visiting chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, predicted <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will hold free elections as soon as next fall.

There has been intense speculation about <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s future over the past week. Major changes are expected soon in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leadership, which includes both reformers as well as holdovers from the era of hard-liner <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> The state-run National-Zeitung daily newspaper reminded its readers that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> belonged to the `` leadership body that is now in the crossfire of criticism.'' In its commentary today, the newspaper also emphasized <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s praise for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership after it crushed the student pro-democracy movement in June, and brought up <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s alleged role in massive election fraud in May `` Egon <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> can not make up lost ground,'' the commentary said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run press, which used to reflect the party leadership's line without fail, has been reporting a greater variety of views in recent weeks. In <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said in a front-page headline: `` Experts Agree: <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> Has Only Four Weeks.'' Bild did not name the experts. The newspaper is published by the giant <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> group, which long has been critical of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leadership. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said more than 400,000 took to the streets of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Halle </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION> in what has become a Monday night ritual of challenge to Communist rule. Street protests that began last month and a mass emigration of young skilled workers have prompted a shakeup in country's leadership, exacting from it promises of fundamental reform and the opening of the country's borders to free travel on Nov. 9 In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, demonstrators denounced government errors that have ruined the economy. Most of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s organized opposition groups are believed to oppose German reunification, but there were calls for <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> unity among some at the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> rally. `` We must not suppress the will for unity. We are one people,'' one unidentified speaker said. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> for talks to work out a visit by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> next month. No date has been set for the visit, but it is expected before Christmas and after the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress on Dec. 15-17. During the talks Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is striving for free general elections, but that their date depended on how quickly the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would pass the new election law, <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> told reporters. The West German official, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s troubleshooter for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, talked for three hours with <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> in the presence of aides and then had a 45-minute private chat with the top Communists.

 Workers cleared streets of trees and power lines today after wind storms left more than 200,000 East Coast homes and businesses without power, battered four parked jets in metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and fanned a three-block fire in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Winds of 63 mph were blamed for the death of a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> woman killed when a warehouse fell on her home. Snow from the same cold front was blamed for the deaths of two young men whose pickup slammed into a tractor-trailer in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The fire early today in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, left at least 35 families in a poor area homeless, Mayor <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. Gusts to 50 mph spread the blaze to more than a dozen houses and apartment buildings, but no injuries were reported. `` We expected it to be windy but we did n't expect it to be this strong,'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Dossett </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, where the wind was clocked at 59 mph. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 18 panes of glass popped loose from a building under construction, raining glass on the street and tying up traffic in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Gusts to 64 mph lifted a parked <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and dropped it on a baggage cart and fuel truck at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. No passengers were on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, but a worker inside the craft's baggage area suffered minor injuries, authorities said. Three Pan Am planes parked outside a hangar at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Kennedy International were damaged by 44 mph gusts, police said The wind blew a 747 into the hangar and pushed another 747 into a fence. Metal scaffolding around a third plane, an A-300 airbus, was blown into the aircraft's skin. `` The storm came in fast and furious and ended almost as quickly,'' police Lt. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassett </PERSON> said. The airport was shut for 45 minutes Monday night. Planes at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> also were delayed for about an hour by the wind. Farther north winds up to 50 mph combined with ice and up to 13 inches of snow in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to make driving nearly impossible this morning. `` It's bad; it's bad; it's bad,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got some areas where it's white-out. You ca n't see past your windshield.'' Utility officials said more than 200,000 customers lost power at the peak of storms Monday night that swirled out of a strong cold front moving across the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION>. Utility crews worked through the night to get the number of customers blacked out in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s and <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> counties, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, down from 20,000 to 14,000 by 7 a.m., said the <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> reported all but 1,300 of 11,000 customers who lost power had electricity again Baltimore Gas and Electric put all but 16,000 of 65,000 affected customers back in service by 5 a.m., and utilities worked to get power back to nearly 110,000 customers in metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 Demonstrators demanding an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> linked arms and surrounded <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Federal Building today for a second day, and police said 131 people were arrested. More than 2,000 people around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> joined demonstrations Monday, tying up traffic in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and heckling President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. At least 230 were arrested Monday. `` We know what this place is for; murder in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' chanted about 400 protesters outside the Federal Building in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> today. Newsracks were overturned and scuffles broke out between protesters and people trying to enter the building to go to work. The latest round of outrage focused on last week's slaying of six Jesuit priests, their houskeeper and her daughter in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The demonstrators blamed the killings on right-wing elements in the central American country's military. The slayings occurred amid heavy fighting as the government drove leftist rebels from the capital, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` It has become very clear over this decade that <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aid ... is that which is destroying the people of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said during the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> demonstration. `` There is no democracy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as long as the army is in control. No one elects the army,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Protests also were held Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The demonstrations came as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected 215-194 an attempt to restrict up to $ 85 million in military aid to the country. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved 409-3 a non-binding resolution saying that bringing the priests' killers to justice would `` be instrumental in determining continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support'' for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended his support of what he called a freely elected government, and defended the government of Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON> against accusations of complicity in the killings. At a political fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rebuked hecklers who accused his administration of responsibility for the deaths. `` We are not. You be quiet,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shot back. Four people were led out by security guards as the crowd applauded. The four, including three women who said they were <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns, were charged with disorderly conduct. Six people who demonstrated outside the hotel where the fund-raiser was held were arrested for obstructing traffic and other minor charges. All 10 were released on their own recognizance. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, about 200 people demonstrated and nine people who staged a protest in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> galleries were arrested, Capitol police said. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, about 300 people demonstrated, some carrying wooden crosses. A mass of protesters up to three deep blocked southbound lanes of Interstate 5 and an exit ramp near the downtown Federal Courthouse, creating a 3-mile back up during morning rush hour. They were dragged away by police as fellow protesters chanted, `` No more bombs, no more war, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' Seventy-two people were arrested, police said. Sixty were given tickets for obstructing traffic and 12 were cited for refusing to give their names or resisting arrest. All were released. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Monday, more than 600 people, including 150 Jesuits, staged a sit-in at the Federal Building and prayed for the thousands slain in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war. Authorities arrested 136 people, including priests, for blocking doors to the building or blocking the sidewalk. Virtually all were cited and released. About 250 people took part in similar marches and vigils at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and about 150 at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, about 50 people marched nearly a mile from a Roman Catholic church to the downtown office of House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wash </LOCATION>, toting banners that read `` Salvadorans Forgive Us.'' Eleven were arrested for refusing to leave <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s office. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. About 500 protesters gathered outside a military recruiting office in Times Square in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said police Sgt <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Between 50 and 60 people held a protest at the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, office of Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and 25 to 30 demonstrated in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Reagan Lawyers Say Subpoena Raises Constitutional Questions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attorneys indicated Wednesday they were considering a challenge to a subpoena for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to produce documents and testify at the Iran-Contra trial of his former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. In court papers asking for a two-week delay, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s private attorneys said the subpoena `` raises novel and complex constitutional issues'' about the power of courts over a former chief executive. The subpoena `` raises weighty and yet unsettled constitutional issues regarding the doctrine of separation of powers and the executive privilege,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lawyers said. The former president was directed by the subpoena to turn over documents needed for <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s trial by Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also sought a delay until Dec. 6 for responding to a subpoena for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> papers that are held by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The subpoenas were served last week after they were approved by the judge in the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former national security adviser is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22 in federal court here on charges of making false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and obstructing congressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair. Defense lawyers have suggested that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> knew about letters that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in response to queries about whether the administration was secretly aiding the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when such assistance was banned by law. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is accused of falsely assuring <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> there was no such assistance. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pleading, filed by a team of lawyers headed by <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, suggested that the former president may invoke the doctrine of executive privilege to resist turning over certain documents or answering certain questions. Executive privilege was invoked by then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> during the Watergate scandal when he tried to withhold tapes of conversations he had with aides in the Oval Office. In a 1974 decision that ultimately led to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s resignation, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered him to turn over the tapes. The high-court's 8-0 ruling, however, appeared to leave room for possible assertions of executive privilege to protect diplomatic, military or state secrets. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lawyers note that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s request for documents covers 67 separate subjects and the list itself is highly classified. The attorneys also raised the possibility that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may seek to invoke executive privilege to block release of some of the documents. In its pleading, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that it had an `` obvious and strong interest'' in the subpoena served on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` because of the sensitive nature and subject of the subpoena directed to him and the potential relationship of the materials sought to the national interest and to the presidency.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that some of the documents sought from the government and from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may be covered by the Classified Information Procedures Act, which regulates the disclosure of government secrets in court.

<HEAD>Nureyev Steps Down, Ending Soap Opera at Paris Opera</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 14-month battle between <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> ended Tuesday when the Soviet-born dancer resigned as dance director of the company he helped bring to prominence. A statement issued after a meeting between <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> said the two `` decided mutually that <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> should step down as dance director.'' The break, however, sounded more like a separation than divorce. The statement said <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> would stay on as `` premier choreographer,'' a post created for him `` to insure the presence of his productions at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera.'' <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON>, 51, had been artistic director since 1983. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera became almost a soap opera in recent weeks, with tensions mounting as <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> exchanged charges in the press. <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON>'s contract as dance director expired Aug. 31. Interviewed last month by the newspaper <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, he complained he had not heard from <PERSON> Berge </PERSON>, whom he later described as harder to reach than God. <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> retorted that it was difficult to communicate with someone who is so rarely in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> has been frequently absent. He is touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with `` The King and I,'' and is scheduled to play the lead role immortalized by <PERSON> Yul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> for another two years. <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> called for the dancer's contract to include a six-month residence clause with the ballet company _ which <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> was certain to refuse. Insiders said <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> hoped to boost the morale of the ballet company, which has not appreciated <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON>'s part-time, long-distance directing. <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> has been replaced temporarily by ballet masters <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> trained and brought into the company. Controversy is nothing new to <PERSON> Berge </PERSON>, who has never been one to back down from a public showdown. Last year, he fired <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> as director of the new Opera-Bastille opera house over his high fees and alleged elitist views on opera. <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> is not expected to disappear like <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>. His `` Sleeping Beauty'' is on the program Dec. 16-31 and his `` Swan Lake'' can be seen from April 21-May 13, 1990. And as `` premier choreographer'' he is expected to revive `` La Bayadere'' in time for next summer. Dance afficcionados say that's only fitting for the man who defected to the West from a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> airport with the apparent approval of then-Culture Minister <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Malraux </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Gasoline, Food Push Consumer Prices Up in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Higher gasoline and food costs pushed consumer prices up 0.5 percent last month, giving the country its biggest spurt of inflation since last May, the government reported Tuesday. The increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index, which translated into an annual inflation rate of 5.9 percent, followed four months in which the index recorded tiny gains of 0.2 percent or less. October's inflation spurt was blamed on a statistical jump in gasoline costs, hefty increases in dairy products and fruit and rising costs for new cars and clothing. Economists for the most part discounted the increase, saying it did not shake their belief that price pressures will remain moderate in coming months. `` This is the first month in five that inflation has been in the problem range and most likely it will not persist,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inflation raced upward in the first five months of the year, only to moderate through the summer as energy prices retreated Through the first 10 months of the year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly from the 4.4 percent price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, predicted that the increase in consumer prices for the entire year will hold at 4.6 percent and will improve to 4.2 percent next year. `` The October increase was just a make-up for some unusually good numbers in the last few months,'' he said. `` With the slowdown in the economy, we think we will get another year of stability in prices.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was also sanguine about October's price increase with presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noting that in the past six months, the CPI has risen at an annual rate of just 3.3 percent. `` This is lower than for any six-month period since December 1986, and lower than the average inflation of 3.6 percent over the last seven years. So inflation holds relatively steady but at a low level,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Gasoline costs climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent in October, the biggest jump since last May. Gasoline prices have been on a roller-coaster ride this year, soaring by 21.2 percent in the first five months and then falling by 9.3 percent from June through September. Pump prices actually were unchanged in October, but they normally fall at the end of the summer driving season. Thus, the frozen price level translated into an increase after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made adjustments to take into account normal seasonal pricing variations. Food costs were up 0.4 percent, the biggest advance since a 0.6 percent May increase. Dairy products posted a huge gain for the second straight month, rising by 1.8 percent, the biggest increase in more than nine years. Fruit and vegetable prices jumped 1.2 percent, led by big gains in the cost of apples and bananas. Consumer prices minus food and energy costs, the inflation measure considered to be a good guage of underlying price pressures, rose 0.5 percent in October, matching the increase in the overall index. New car prices, reflecting the introduction of 1990 models and higher financing costs, rose 0.6 percent after having fallen for five consecurtive months. Used car prices, however, continued to decline, edging down 0.1 percent. Clothing costs, which took a big 1.7 percent rise in September, rose another 1 percent in October, reflecting higher costs for the fall and winter lines. Home heating oil costs were up a sharp 2.5 percent while natural gas and electricity prices rose a more modest 0.3 percent. Medical costs, which rose 0.7 percent in October, are 8.1 percent higher than a year ago, the biggest increase of any of the major price categories. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which began the year fighting inflation by pushing interest rates higher, has been lowering rates in recent months because of concerns over widespread economic weakness. Many analysts predicted that the October blip in consumer prices would not deter the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> from making further credit easing moves in the months ahead. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does n't like to see the inflation rates this high but the economy is very weak right now and that is their overriding concern,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. Before taking into account normal seasonal variations, the Consumer Price Index stood at 125.6 in October, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $ 100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost $ 125.60 last month, up from $ 120.20 a year ago. In a separate report Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that Americans' average weekly earnings rose to $ 343.07 in October, 4 percent higher than a year ago, but not enough to keep up with inflation during this time period.

<HEAD>World Bank Would Reverse Declines in Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Embargoed for 6:30 p.m. EST; time set by source. ^By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday offered a long-term program aimed at reversing the decline of schools, incomes and farming in large parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during the 1980s. The program proposes policy changes to allow African governments to reach a goal of 5 percent growth in annual income, more emphasis on helping Africans take responsibility for improving their lives, better administration, checking the population growth and protecting its enviornment, and more foreign aid. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which lends about $ 4 billion a year to black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is the largest single source of aid to Third World countries. Its proposal was outlined in a 314-page report, `` <LOCATION> Sub-Saharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ From Crisis to Sustainable Growth.'' `` This report examines ... what has gone wrong and why,'' <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` More importantly, it lays out a strategic agenda for the 1990s.'' The report deals with the entire African continent, except the northern tier of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the Republic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the far south. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said he wanted changes in some nations' military spending, but declined to cite specific countries. `` Military spending has diverted enormous resources from southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s development, and has consumed nearly 50 percent of government expenditures in the countries experiencing the worst destabilization,'' the report said. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said that, for the first time, defense costs will be formally taken into account in discussions between the bank and African countries. It's also expected to be an element in negotiations of the bank's sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The report predicted that black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s population would grow by 3.1 percent a year until the end of the century, the same rate as in the 1980s and six times as fast as the average in high-income countries. Because total production in few <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries has been growing at that speed, there would have to be considerable improvement to keep average incomes from declining further. The report emphasized the need to increase African food production to keep up with population. African farms increased their output by only 1.3 percent from 1980 to 1987, less than half the rise in population. African imports of grain nearly doubled between 1974 and 1986, while shipments sent as aid by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries more than tripled over the same period. The report called for continued relief from debts owed by <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries, mainly to western governments, so that payments in the 1990s are kept to the same level as in the 1980s _ about $ 9 billion a year. `` If this does not occur, higher levels of external assistance will be necessary,'' it warned. Figures used by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> showed total aid rising from $ 11 billion in 1987 to $ 13 billion in 1988. Aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been declining, from $ 1.35 billion in 1986 to $ 738 million in 1988.

 Armed rebels today stormed a luxury hotel in northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and held dozens of foreigners inside. Four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers were reported captured. Soldiers in an armored personnel carrier rescued the secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, who had been inside a different part of the building when the leftist guerrillas attacked. Six government helicopters flew over the homes and tennis club around the Sheraton Hotel in the wealthy neighborhood of <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION>. Hundreds of soldiers moved into the area, frequently pinned down by guerrilla fire. The army moved several tanks into the neighborhood to combat the attackers, who were renewing an urban offensive that had appeared to be dying out. Four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers, and two other advisers, one from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, were captured near the hotel, said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` They are considered prisoners, but we will respect their lives and they will not be harmed,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. Cable News Network, quoting an army spokesman, Col. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Amando </PERSON> <PERSON> Aviles </PERSON>, said four Americans were being held at the hotel. <PERSON> Aviles </PERSON> did not say whether the Americans were in the military. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he was unable to confirm the report. `` I have n't heard that,'' he said by telephone. `` I do n't think it's true but I ca n't be sure.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was `` making plans as necessary'' to protect the lives of Americans in the hotel. Twenty-nine people, mostly foreigners, were held by the guerrillas. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> asked the government to agree to allow a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> team to come to the hotel and evacuate guests, aside from the military advisers, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. The rebels held a part of the hotel known as the VIP Tower. Hotel executives and others, including <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, holed up in an administrative office in the main building. <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, on a peace mission to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, told the hotel manager that he wanted to be evacuated with the other guests. Later, soldiers in an armored personnel carrier drove up to the front of the main building and evacuated him. It was not immediately clear whether others were taken with him. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the embassy maintained an open line to some of the Americans in the hotel but said he did not know how many were there. Fifty-five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers are in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` The objective is to take Escalon,'' said a guerrilla who gave his name as `` <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON>.'' He was in charge of an insurgent position 80 yards from the four-star hotel. `` We're taking <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON> because here the armed forces are not going to bombard people's homes. This is where the oligarchy lives,'' <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> said. He said his rebel unit had been in Mejicanos, one of several poor suburbs and neighborhoods where the guerrillas dug in during their massive offensive last week. The fighting ended several days of relative calm in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, one target of a rebel offensive launched Nov. 11. The new attack comes one day after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirmed his administration's strong support for the right-wing government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided about $ 3.5 billion in the past 10 years to help the government fight the insurgency. A guerrilla official in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said Monday the offensive would continue because the fighting had not yet convinced the government that it can not win the war. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> said the offensive would keep on `` with other surprises bigger than that of Nov. 11'' until the government is convinced it must make concessions and begin to negotiate. At least 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds if not thousands rendered homeless in the latest offensive. A British journalist, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON>, was wounded today in the lower back and taken to the <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>. <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> reporter based in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was later reported in fair condition. The fighting followed several explosions and exchanges of rifle fire in the western sector of the capital at 4:30 a.m. The blasts appeared to come from the direction of <LOCATION> Merliot </LOCATION>, a suburb where combat flared Monday, or from the slopes of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> volcano that looms over the capital's northwestern sector. A little less than an hour later, other explosions were heard echoing from the direction of the volcano and an airplane equipped with rockets and machine-guns was heard making passes over the city's outskirts. The later blasts appeared to be from heavy munitions, perhaps 120mm government mortars. Officials said the rebels had blown up seven of the country's 16 main power lines along with about 40 towers and other equipment. The fighting then moved to the area surrounding the Sheraton. The hotel's coffee shop was the site of the Jan. 3, 1981 slayings of the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> advisers, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, Md. and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Two National Guardsmen were convicted of murder in the killings, but released in 1988 under an amnesty given for political crimes. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was asked Monday if the raids, the massacre of six Jesuit priests on Thursday and other incidents indicated <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was having trouble maintaining control over the more extreme elements in his rightist government. `` Management control problems exist in situations like this,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also rejected attempts to restrict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, heeding an admonition from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to further weaken a `` freely, democratically elected government.'' The decade-long war has claimed more than 71,000 lives, mostly civilians.

 Eighteen of the 20 college fraternity pledges who infuriated police by saying nothing but `` Sheep run north, sir,'' have been told charges will be dropped if they stay out of trouble for three months. The other two did not show up in court on Monday and their cases were rescheduled. The 20 Pace University students were charged with disorderly conduct Oct. 13 when they refused to tell police what they were doing at 2 a.m. walking on Route 9A. They would only respond with the phrase, `` Sheep run north, sir.'' Members of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> had driven the pledges, blindfolded, up near the <LOCATION> Croton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> and dropped them off with no identification and no money. The pledges were ordered to use only the `` sheep'' phrase if anyone asked them anything. They were walking back to school when police stopped them. All 20 were arrested and given disorderly conduct tickets.

<TEXT>
 Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> on Tuesday announced a plan to `` calm the turbulence'' in her discontented workforce to ensure that agency employees provide quality service to the public. In a speech to 14,000 <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> workers in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area, transmitted by satellite to employees elsewhere, Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said morale has suffered in recent years as a result of massive staff cuts at a time when the Social Security workload was increasing. `` I do n't believe we can guarantee the kind of public service we need to ... unless we first take steps to ensure that our workforce is energized and focused on our mission,'' she told reporters in a preview of the speech. To her employees, she acknowledged: `` I realize that many of you feel overworked, that you do n't believe your efforts are properly recognized and that many of you would n't recommend <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> employment to a friend.'' `` In the weeks and months ahead, I will have no higher priority than to heal these wounds,'' she said. `` I want to calm the turbulence and replace uncertainty with stability.'' The agency's workforce has been slashed by 20 percent to 65,000 over the last six years as part of a campaign to modernize and streamline operations. Surveys showed increasing numbers of supervisors felt the agency was doing a poor job of providing top quality service to the public. `` When you combine cutbacks in the size of the agency with increased public demand for service, turmoil is likely to be the result,'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> told reporters. `` I believe we have to get beyond that.'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who assumed the top Social Security job in August, proposed a new `` compact'' with her employees. For her part, she promised to resist further staff cuts, adjust uneven staffing levels that create shortages in some offices, communicate with employees in advance of major program changes, provide more equipment such as computer terminals, and relax unreasonably demanding job performance standards. Employees, meanwhile, were asked to avoid internal strife, become proficient in new technologies such as computers, take a greater role in agency decisions and resolve to treat each member of the public `` as a unique individual and not a case number or a file.'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> also said additional emphasis would be placed on outreach programs to needy people who may not be getting the benefits to which they are entitled, and on efforts to ensure that only trustworthy people are appointed to handle the Social Security checks of those who can not manage their own finances.

<HEAD>Discovery Launch Planned for After Dark Wednesday</HEAD>

 Crews worked under a tight schedule to ready the shuttle Discovery for an after-dark launch Wednesday with a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman predicting the crew would have Thanksgiving turkey in space. Workers made up for time lost on a parts replacement earlier and <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said `` from a technical standpoint we look good and from a weather standpoint we look good.'' The launch time is a secret and so is the nature of the military payload the crew of five is to put into orbit. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said only that liftoff is set between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. EST. There is only a 20 percent chance weather will interfere, forecasters said. If the launch has to be Thursday, the weather outlook worsens to 60 percent unfavorable. The menu released for the mission includes `` thermostabilized'' turkey and gravy, which means the food has enough preservatives to be carried without refrigeration. `` We are hopeful the crew will have Thanksgiving dinner in space,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Checking systems and putting the two solid fuel booster rockets back together had put the schedule in jeopardy. The rockets were opened last week to inspect computer boxes for faulty wiring and one box was replaced. The flight, commanded by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said keeping advance knowledge of the expected liftoff time secret makes tracking the shuttle more difficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship sitting off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. Announcement of an imminent launch will be made nine minutes before the event, but there will be no public air-to-ground link during the mission. The cargo is believed to be a satellite capable of monitoring diplomatic and military communications in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries. The launch will be only the third after nightfall in 32 shuttle missions and is, like the others, expected to provide a spectacular sight in this central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> area. The last night launch, in November 1985, was visible along the 700 miles from <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> S.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, and the pilot <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, practiced night landings on the shuttle runway here in a jet equipped to handle like a shuttle. Disovery is scheduled to land at night at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after a flight expected to last four days. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> also would have to land the shuttle in the dark here or at emergency runways in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in case of an abort after liftoff. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, who flew on a 1985 shuttle mission, is the first black shuttle commander. The other crew members are <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>.

 About a dozen people showed up at a restaurant Tuesday to help in the renewed search for a 9-year-old boy missing the past month in rugged south-central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

 Students at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> have set a world record for nonstop arguing, debating topics from aquaculture to Gummi Bears and Jell-O, school officials say. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> passed the previous record for non-stop debating _ 100 hours and six minutes _ at 8:42 p.m. Monday, said school spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. As the buzzer sounded, members of the audience stood on their chairs and cheered. Debaters sprayed each other with champagne, then took a permitted break before debating some more. They kept going to 11:30 p.m. The previous record _ according to the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> _ was held by <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The debate on solutions to world hunger began at 9:30 a.m. Thursday. Along with discussing funding, aquaculture and redistribution of food, they debated Gummi Bears, Jell-O and Gatorade as possible solutions. Under the Guinness rules, a five-minute rest was allowed for each hour of debate. Two witnesses had to be present at all times, excluding the four debaters. The entire debate was filmed, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. The debaters were allowed one hour of sleep a day, usually from 5:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.

 With a bellow of `` Order! Order!'' the gowned and bewigged Speaker brought <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers into line Tuesday as TV cameras gave Britons their first pictures of their elected legislators in action. Thirty years after first rejecting the notion, the elected chamber of the Mother of Parliaments finally bowed to the electronic age as eight remote-control cameras recorded the cut and thrust of the government and the opposition, seated two sword lengths and a foot apart. At precisely 2:30 p.m., Speaker <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON> popped onto TV screens, resplendent in shoulder-length horsehair wig and black gown, and called the excited, fidgeting lawmakers to order. The first images were broadcast live by two of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s four national networks and the satellite station, <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. The honor of giving the first televised speech from the green leather benches was given to Conservative <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gow </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister who opposes the cameras and says he does n't know how to operate his own VCR. But Labor lawmaker <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> beat him to it with a procedural interjection during <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON>'s annual recitation of the Sessional Orders, which remind lawmakers of parliamentary rules and instruct <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard to ensure their free access to the Palce of <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gow </PERSON> said Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> invited him to her Downing Street residence for a drink on the eve of the first televised session. `` It seems we were both feeling rather nervous about our speeches,'' he confessed in a radio interview. In her first televised speech, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> promised more of her free-market medicine in 1990. Opposition Labor leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> attacked her policies as failures. The debate broke no new ground, but seeing it on TV gave it an unusual sense of drama. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was combative, at times shrill when the opposition got raucous. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> looked more relaxed. The unelected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> has permitted TV broadcasts of its proceedings since 1985, including the pageantry enveloping Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s ceremonial State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday morning. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, the often-rowdy elected chamber down the hallway of the Palace of Westminster, steadfastly resisted until February 1988. It then agreed to a nine-month experiment. Radio broadcasting was approved in 1978. A parliamentary committee drafted strict rules for the cameras, although the opening broadcasts appeared to be interpreting them liberally. To deter lawmakers from mounting camera-grabbing spectacles, the broadcasters are supposed to show only the head and shoulders of whoever is speaking. They are also barred from showing empty benches, lest viewers get the notion their representatives are goofing off. But several speakers, including <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, were shown from the waist up as they spoke. The shots were wide enough to show the facial reactions of several colleagues. Screening rowdiness is also taboo. At the first hint of a disturbance, the cameras are to focus on <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON>, who is elected by fellow lawmakers to preside over debates and quell the booing and braying that often interrupts debate. <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON>, who turns 69 Saturday, is the son of a Savile Row tailor who still carries a thimble in his pocket because his mother said it would keep him humble. <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON> approves of the televising, and said Tuesday he hoped it `` will show the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> at work as it really is.'' The cameras occasionally switched to wide-angle shots, showing the 650-member Commons packed to the aisles. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> called it a `` historic day,'' while <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spoke of `` the newest drama in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>.'' For the uninterested, two other channels offered `` Angel in Exile,'' a low-budget Western, the drama serial `` Take the High Road,'' the game show `` Tell the Truth,'' and `` Coronation Street,'' the popular British soap opera. The separation of benches by swords' lengths dates from older times, when it was feared heated debate might degenerate into fighting. Many lawmakers chose special attire for their TV debut. Conservative <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> sported his <ORGANIZATION> Scots </ORGANIZATION> kilt and a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> tie. `` Narrow striped shirts have disappeared in favor of blue and yellow. And the ties have got distinctly brighter this morning,'' said Conservative lawmaker <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hind </PERSON>. `` Hair has been shortened and some of the men ... are carrying powder puffs in their pockets to beautify their sallow complexions for the cameras,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> wore her customary blue suit.

 Lev. <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>, the hard-liner who has served as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for two years, was replaced Tuesday to become President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s top deputy on the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Party officials called the move a promotion for <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>, who is also a member of the ruling Soviet Politburo. He was succeeded as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss by <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>, 50, who as second party secretary in the Soviet capital had been <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>'s deputy The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>, 66, received the gratitude of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party committee that voted in plenary session to replace him, indicating he was leaving in official good graces. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>'s departure `` is connected to his appointment to the post of the first deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his role as president, chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for elaborating national defense policy and whose membership was once top-secret. <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> will bring to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> experience in military-related matters, since he formerly served under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as the party's top official overseeing the defense industry and in 1983-85 as party chief in the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> region, one of the centers of the Soviet armaments industry. He took the helm of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party organization in November 1987 after his predecessor, maverick politician <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, was fired in disgrace for criticizing the slow pace of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms One of the most powerful officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apparatus, <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> has supported the policy of promoting scientific and technological progress, but has called for limits in the party's drive for `` glasnost,'' or greater openness. This spring, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>'s party apparatus clashed head-on in the country's first multicandidate elections in seven decades, with <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> claiming the party was trying to sabotage his bid to win the Moscow-wide seat in the new <ORGANIZATION> Coongress </ORGANIZATION> of People's Deputies Muscovites massively showed their support for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, giving him 89 percent of the vote against the party machine candidate, the director of a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> automobile and truck works.

 A <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman who said she stole $ 5.5 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to give to the poor was indicted today by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, a court clerk said. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, who has been dubbed `` Robin <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' was charged with theft of government property, making false statements to the federal government, making false statements in connection with a loan application and aiding and abetting, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> clerk in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The clerk spoke on condition of annoymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> planned to announce the indictment formally later in the day. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>'s attorney, federal public defender <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, were not immediately successful. A receptionist at his office said <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> was in court on an unrelated matter and not available. Prosecutors began presenting evidence to the grand jury not long after <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> testified to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last June that she withheld the $ 5.5 million from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> while handling the sale of government-owned property and used some of it to assist charities and the homeless. Word of the possible indictment first came Monday when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Breckinridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> said he would announce today a `` major development'' in a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> case. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, had said the announcement would involve the <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> case and that prosecutors had asked the grand jury to indict her. `` I ca n't say anything more at this time,'' <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said in a brief telephone conversation Monday evening. Meanwhile, a report released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> appears to have repeatedly violated ethics laws by using her government contacts to help her private business. The report urged the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who was accused of using her influence on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials to benefit the consulting firm she has headed since leaving <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>'s testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was among the most dramatic during six months of hearings into allegations of fraud, mismanagement and political favoritism at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Two weeks after she testified, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> seized her house in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburbs as well as several other properties she said she purchased with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to help various charities and homeless families. `` I in no way justify what I have done as being anything less than sin,'' she told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee in June. `` I do, regardless of where my life takes me from here, intend to repay in full all monies taken.'' <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, who was a private escrow agent hired by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to handle the sales of HUD-owned properties, said she was easily able to withhold money from the department. Several top officials in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office, to which she reported, were fired because of the <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> case and other alleged mismanagement <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping some of the money they were supposed to transfer to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. When she lost her house in late June, <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> said she was moving in with her mother in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Md. Attempts to reach her Monday were unsuccessful; the mother's telephone number is unlisted.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s new assembly joined in applause Tuesday when the dominant party, which espoused Marxism for two decades, proposed a democratic framework for the independence constitution. <LOCATION> SWAPO </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, fought a 23-year war against South African rule and won 41 of the 72 constituent assembly seats earlier this month. At least 48 members, a two-thirds majority, must approve the charter written by the assembly. Twenty-one seats are held by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy in the predominantly black territory, and the 10 remaining seats are distributed among five other parties. The assembly met in the Tintenpalast, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s seat of government since German colonial rulers built it in 1910. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured the territory, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, in 1915, during World War <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> <PERSON> Geingob </PERSON>, elected chairman of the assembly, told the opening session: `` The electorate has given us a mandate to hammer out, and adopt, in a spirit of compromise, a spirit of give-and-take, a constitution that will lead our people into nationhood.'' <PERSON> Geingob </PERSON> was in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> election campaign. Members applauded when <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>, who handles foreign affairs for <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, proposed that the constitution be based on democratic principles outlined in a 1982 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> document setting up the procedures for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence. He offered a motion saying the constitution should be the supreme law of the land, with specific procedures for amendment, and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> should have an independent judiciary and an elected executive responsible to the legislative branch. <PERSON> Guirab </PERSON> said a declaration of rights should include freedom of movement, speech and association; a free press; the right to life, personal liberty and property, and freedom from racial, ethnic, religious or sexual discrimination. His motion could not be adopted because the assembly will not have rules of order until it meets again on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> espoused Marxist principles during most of its history, and its stand on democratic principles during the campaign was vague and contradictory. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, told the assembly: `` I'm here with great humility and pride. Pride, because an occasion like this only happens once in a lifetime. Humility because I, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, son of an ordinary citizen, have been honored to be part of the struggle that brought us here and to lead us to nationhood.'' As he and other former guerrilla leaders mounted the steps of the yellow-and-white colonial government building, <PERSON> Erica </PERSON> <PERSON> Beukes </PERSON>, one of four protesters, screamed that they were `` killers.'' She and the others belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has demanded that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> reveal the fates of more than 400 people it detained in its foreign camps as spies. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation concluded more than 100 were dead and no information could be obtained about 350 others. Hundreds of swaying, ululating <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporters surged around <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, chanting `` Viva!'' as his bodyguards pushed a path through the crowd. The parties have said they hope the constitution will be completed by early next year and independence can be declared shortly afterward. <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team monitoring the transition, attended the assembly's opening session. He has said he expects <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to become independent before the his group's scheduled departure at the end of March <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> governed <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> under a League of Nations mandate. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> revoked it in 1966, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> refused to leave and the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> began for control of the vast, mineral-rich territory and its 1.5 million people. Earlier this year, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to allow independence under a U.S.-mediated peace accord that also called for withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor.

<HEAD>Utility Workers Enlisted in Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 600 utility workers in 41 counties have been organized into a network to tell police of possible drug laboratories. Line workers, meter readers, billing clerks and other employees were trained last month by police to look for signs of clandestine laboratories that make methamphetamine, or speed. `` We're seeing more and more of these labs in rural areas, where the neighbors are not on top of them to report things like noxious fumes, noise and fans running all the time,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, training coordinator for the state attorney general's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> and Investigations. `` Because rural electric linemen are out there in the countryside, they do come across things,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` But this is the first time I know of where they're being trained or alerted to some kind of drug surveillance.'' Police say signs of an illegal drug lab include chemical odors coming from barns or houses, discarded chemical containers, fans whirring through the night, unusually high consumption of water or electricity, extreme fluctuations in power use, and large cash purchases of land and equipment, especially by new residents. Thirteen electricity cooperatives have established `` drug awareness teams'' as part of a program managed by the attorney general's office. The cooperatives are non-profit power companies whose customers are voting members with a voice in how the utility is run. All serve rural areas, where police patrols are spread thin. Rural electric workers `` travel the back roads and are in a better position to see things that normally go unnoticed,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukick </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Harrisburg-based trade group. `` We told our people not to investigate. If they see something suspicious, turn and run in the other direction and contact the police,'' he said. Utility officials said most employees endorsed the program. But some worried they would be seen as spies by their neighbors or could become involved with dangerous criminals. `` They want to handle it in confidence and keep a low profile. They do n't want to put themselves at risk,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Dezich </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> sees a `` tremendous potential for abuse'' in the program, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> chapter. `` There's nothing wrong with a lineman or anyone else reporting something suspicious to police,'' she said. `` But if fluctuating electricity use is the sole basis for going to court to get a warrant, then we have a problem with that. There are many innocent reasons for a fluctuation to occur.'' <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> may monitor the program. <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON>, whose association represents 1,000 rural electric systems in 46 states and 25 million rural customers, said: `` We are developing a national program to identify drug problems in rural areas and what role rural electrics can play in solving the growing drug problem in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We're beginning to talk to our members now ... to see how we can coordinate this.''

 In this small community where <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> live, friends understand but strangers question why the parents of seven persevered until they proved a 10-year-old stranger was their daughter. `` The folks who know us, our friends, have been real supportive. Some of the people who work with me for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> have called to say, ` We're with you,''' <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> said. `` But others wonder why we're pursuing this, why we could n't just let it drop I guess you'd have to be a parent to know why,'' he said from the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> station where he's a ticket agent. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> went back to work Monday, after lawyers went public with the news that genetic tests showed two families had raised the other's child. The Twiggs say their real daughter is <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> who was switched in a hospital nursery with the child they took home a decade ago. That child, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, died last year of heart disease. The girls were born just days apart at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in the rural central Floriday city of <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> in the fall of 1978. Test results released Sunday found a 99.9 percent chance that <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> is actually a <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, and a 98.9 percent chance that <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> was the daughter of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, who died of cancer in 1981. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> has not commented since the test results were released. He is expected to attend a news conference at his attorney's office in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Salk </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> professor of psychology, said the revelation triggers a common fear. `` This affects us all,'' he said. `` It brings out the ` Were we switched?' fear. I imagine it will kick up anxiety in other children.'' <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> was one of seven child psychologists or psychiatrists asked by <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>' attorney to state what effect the Twiggs' effort to ascertain biological parenthood would have on <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>. In 1988, all seven said that pursuing the case would be harmful to the 10-year-old. Some or all of them may be called by the court to help recommend a visitation plan between the Twiggs and <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>. The Twiggs agreed not to seek custody of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> in an agreement with <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> that allowed the genetic testing.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't have to worry about a dearth of good books to curl up with in front of the fireplace this winter. <ORGANIZATION> Esquire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> has shipped off 34 books picked for the president by the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Esquire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honorees </ORGANIZATION>. There's something for every mood, from the Bible, picked by <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, to the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> catalog from the art show that touched off a political firestorm over government funding of art. Actor <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>'s `` Love Story,'' because `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could get out of it how much they cared for each other. It's so sad that they're not together Plus, it's short, he can get right back to business.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is getting a variety of historical tomes, including `` Roots,'' by <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, picked by <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulls </ORGANIZATION> star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, and `` The Autobiography of <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>,'' courtesy of filmmaker <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shilts </PERSON>' chronicle of the AIDS crisis, `` And the Band Played On,'' was picked by two of the honorees. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, founder and executive director of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, named the newsroom classic, `` The Elements of Style,'' by <PERSON> Strunk </PERSON> and <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` I'd like him to correct his broken syntax,'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, waging her first televised parliamentary battle Tuesday, clashed bitterly with the opposition over <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Inflation, high interest rates and the deficit also played starring roles in the live telecast on three British networks. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> again attacked the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for a social charter harmonizing workers' rights in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the 11 other member states `` Instead of encouraging the creation of new jobs, it would add to industry's costs and thereby price people out of work,'' she said in the debate, which kicked off the year's legislative program and marked the first time the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> has been televised. The charter would export jobs to more competitive countries, she said. `` We can not accept a text which would completely reverse the very policies which have been responsible for our economic success over the past 10 years. `` What we could accept is a much more general declaration which ... respects the right of each member state to follow its own social policies.'' `` The parts -LRB- of the charter -RRB- we are firmly in favor of are those parts which will lead to the creation of new jobs and will not oppose competition and competitive costs,'' she said. But she opposed the parts that would put `` greater burdens on industry and reduce our competitiveness.'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposition, chastised Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for drawing a dichotomy between reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s moves toward greater unity. `` For you to try to equate the efforts of any of the democracies in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with the system in the East that is collapsing under the weight of its own inefficiences and injustice, is absurd,'' he said. `` You should change your attitude, as it helps no one, least of all your country. Before 1939, there were many Europes, since then, there have been two Europes bitterly divided. `` Now there is the beginning of a possibility that there will be one <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a continent with borders, but without barriers.'' He ridiculed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s claim that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economy was `` fundamentally strong.'' `` When I hear that claim, I have to ask why, if there is such an abundance of confidence, we in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have to pay 15 percent interest rates in order to buy the confidence. `` As for underlying strength, just look at our economy. In 10 oil-rich years of this government, we have seen the economy suffering fron chronic traffic congestion, delay and danger as a result of systematic and sustained under-funding.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> welcomed the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and promised aid, but warned against dropping <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s military guard. `` Times of great change are times of great uncertainty, even danger. `` We have to be prepared for any threat, however unexpected. As events demonstrate ever more conclusively, we are winning the battle of ideas. We must make sure that we do n't subsequently lose the peace,'' she said. Rebutting <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s criticisms, she said the present 7.3 percent inflation rate was lower than anything achieved by Labor between 1974 and 1979, when it was last in power. `` But a rate which was a cause for celebration for them ... is a cause of concern for us, because it is far too high by our standards,'' she said. `` The absolute priority is to get inflation down. But it is not only Government policy that will determine the prospects for growth and jobs. They depend on how well businesses keep their costs down.'' She said her government's legislative program was aimed at enlarging opportunity and enhancing the quality of life. `` The old class-based order is being replaced by one based on merit, ability and effort. This is the new <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the 1990s,'' she said.

 A 10-year-old boy suffering from a rare brain tumor has captured the official world record for receiving the most get-well cards, officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Shergold </PERSON>'s mountain of 1,256,266 get-well cards tops the previous record of 1,000,265 cards held by another English boy, 12-year-old <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Morby </PERSON>. A spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> received an official certificate and his record will be included in the next edition of the book, `` The Guinness Book of Records 1991.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said in an interview from his home in <LOCATION> Carshalton </LOCATION>, south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, that he was confident he would make it into the record books when his attempt began Sept. 24. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Shergold </PERSON> said the attempt to break the world record began as a way to cheer up her son after he was too sick to meet Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>. `` He was really feeling low after that, so we said, ` Let's go for the Guinness Book of Records,''' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Shergold </PERSON> said an emergency operation in January removed three-quarters of her son's tumor. The cancer spread to <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>'s spinal cord, but doctors believe they have successfully stemmed the disease with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Mrs. <PERSON> Shergold </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know about the tumor on the brain so we take one day at a time,'' she said. `` The cards have been the best medicine in the world.'' If the boy's health continues to improve, Mrs. <PERSON> Shergold </PERSON> said she and her husband, <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON>, and their other son, who is 23, are planning to take <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Disneyworld </LOCATION> in February. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, who is bald from the cancer treatments, said all of the publicity about the card does n't bother him, although he gets tired. The appeal began by word of mouth and then turned to fax machines. Notices were sent to companies requesting get-well cards and for the fax to be sent on to two more companies. The faxes circulated throughout <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> before reaching the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDougall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> decorators supply company, participated in the record attempt by alerting their 100 depots. The company received 30,000 cards, which were packed in bags and sent by courier to <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>. `` It was slow at first, and then they just started flooding in,'' said <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, who counted the pile of cards sent to <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON>'s mail room. `` Some people sent presents and chocolates. It was really heartening.'' The collection officially ended Nov. 19, but cards continue to arrive from all over the world. Mrs. <PERSON> Shergold </PERSON> appealed to well-wishers to stop sending cards. One of <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>'s favorites came from Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, the pilot credited with saving the lives of 184 of the 296 passengers on board the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 which crashed on July 19 in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` For three months I've been receiving cards from all over the world from people who've cared. It's meant a great deal to me,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> wrote in the letter, which included some pilot wings. Mrs. <PERSON> Shergold </PERSON> said their local post office had been very helpful. `` They've taken over a warehouse free of charge for us and when we've opened and read all of the cards we put them in bags of 2,000,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shergold </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday signed a $ 157 billion labor, health and education appropropriations bill shorn of language that would have liberalized Medicaid financing for abortions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had vetoed an earlier version of the bill in a battle with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over abortion financing. In a statement, the president praised <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for bowing to his insistence that Medicaid fund abortions only to save the life of the mother. The bill originally would have allowed Medicaid to pay for abortions for poor women who had been raped or were the victims of incest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the provision `` would have deprived innocent, unborn children of the most basic civil right, the right to life.'' He said the massive spending bill for the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, plus related agencies, will finance `` some of the nation's most important programs _ programs that help the needy, the unemployed, the sick and the infirm, and programs that provide for the education of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children.'' He noted that the legislation includes nearly $ 1.6 billion to combat the deadly AIDS virus and $ 5.4 billion for remedial education for disadvantaged students. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, surrounded by 13 children, also signed a proclamation declaring this National Adoption Week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has sought to spur adoption as an alternative to abortion, said each of the 50,000 children adopted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a year repay their new families a hundredfold. But he said thousands more children still wait to be adopted, many of them with special needs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass legislation giving parents a $ 3,000 tax deduction to help cover the costs of adopting children with disabilities or other special needs. He shook hands and asked the names of each child, recognizing at least one boy from an earlier adoption ceremony, then expressed regret that first dog <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> was not allowed into the ceremonial rooms. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, putting her husband's thought into action, took care of that. `` Pretty cute kids, I'll tell you,'' said the first lady. She instructed <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, the president's personal aide, to let the dog in, and in a flash <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> ran into the Roosevelt Room. The dog raced in, ran around the kids and raced out. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called her back and hoisted her up for a girl in a wheelchair to pet. `` That's all for <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>. Goodbye!'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as the pet trotted off.

<TEXT>
 Children, many clutching their parents' hands, returned Tuesday to their storm-damaged school where seven classmates died last week, as tornado-stricken <PERSON> Coldenham </PERSON> continued to heal with unexpected help The morning mail was filled with donations again Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Coldenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Donors, some anonymous, have given $ 61,000 to help families after the tornado, which also injured 18 at the school, said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, assistant fire chief. Children have walked into the firehouse with coffee cans filled with change and one man anonymously donated about $ 5,000 in quarters, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. All firefighters know was that the man's vehicle had <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> license plates, he said `` It's great,'' he said. `` It's something a little bit to the positive side.'' Classes were held at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coldenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since the tornado hit Thursday at lunchtime and blew in the glass and concrete cafeteria wall. Parents brought children in for counseling Monday to make the first day back less jarring. With a cold northwest wind shaking a flagpole and violently flapping the flag, few parents and children paused in front of the boarded-up cafeteria wall. Flowers remained piled against the wood that has replaced shattered glass and bricks. The school is trying to get back to something like normal operations before Thanksgiving, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoonmaker </PERSON>, assistant superintendent for the Valley Central school district. Rooms were set aside at the school for children and adults to grieve and counselors remained on hand, officials said. Students went back to school Monday at the district's other six schools. Coldenham firefighters have taken toy fire engines and other playthings to children still hospitalized, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. Eleven are still in the hospital, with two in criltical condition and one fair. The rest were in good or satisfactory conditon Tuesday. `` We've visited every child and brought them gifts and it is as much for our therapy as theirs,'' he said. Firefighters began getting donations even before they thought to set up a memorial fund, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. A committee was hurriedly set up to allocate the money, which will be used partly for hospital and funeral fees for the stricken families, he said. The last five funerals were Monday. The fund also will be used to pay expenses for <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sbordone </PERSON>, the eighth East Coldenham student to die in the last week. <PERSON> Sbordone </PERSON> died Monday from injuries suffered in an auto accident Sunday a few hundred yards from the school's entrance. Her parents, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sbordone </LOCATION>, have donated the 5-year-old girl's organs for transplant. `` She's going to live on in someone else,'' <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sbordone </PERSON> said. `` Other children are going to live because of her. Some other grieving family is going to have joy because of her.''

 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man being sought in the abduction of his two young sons was arraigned on murder charges Tuesday after he walked into a county jail and told a receptionist he had killed the boys. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Denton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was ordered held pending a bail hearing Nov. 29. No plea was entered. According to affidavit by state police Detective <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said at the <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail: `` I need to see a police officer. I've killed my kids.'' <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> told police he used a 12-gauge shotgun to kill the boys Monday and left the weapon in the back of his car, <PERSON> Gomane </PERSON> said. Authorities said the shotgun was recovered. Authorities found the boys' bodies, both with gunshot wounds, on a dirt road in a wooded area near <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Shapleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, state police said. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> native, and the boys apparently had been staying without permission at a <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> cottage owned by <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, said state police Sgt <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> made no comments to reporters as he entered the courthouse. His court-appointed lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, had little to say. `` I have n't even had the opportunity to discuss the full set of facts with my client,'' he said. On Sept. 1, <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>'s divorce from <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, 40, of <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, became final and he took custody of his sons for the Labor Day weekend, <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> Police Capt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> was supposed to return the boys on Sept. 4 but did not. Their mother contacted police the next day; a kidnapping warrant was issued on Oct. 16. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> told police he had planned to turn himself in on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> charge Monday but then shot his sons when they began crying and did not want to go home, officers said. `` He started into town to turn himself in. They started crying, and he shot them,'' <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> said. Spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCausland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> identified the older boy as <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 6. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> officials identified the younger boy as <PERSON> Ronney </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, 4, but <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> authorities identified the younger boy as <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>. Neither agency was able to explain the discrepancy Tuesday. Autopsies Tuesday revealed that the boys died of gunshot wounds to the head and chest, <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON> said, adding that each boy was shot twice at close range. Authorities said they believe <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> area around Sept. 4 and that he worked briefly at a department store there before taking the boys to <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> enrolled the older boy in <ORGANIZATION> Canaan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in late October for about two weeks, then moved to <LOCATION> Yarmouth </LOCATION> where he worked at a dry cleaning business from Nov. 6 to Nov. 8, <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON> said. The sergeant said authorities searched for <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kittery </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>. `` Each time we checked these locations, there was another move on his part, indicating he was aware he was being hunted.'' <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> authorities would likely wait for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> officials to finish legal proceedings before seeking an extradition on kidnapping charges.

<HEAD>Rival Parties Agree on Interim Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s three main parties reached agreement Tuesday for an all-party, interim government to end the stalemate that followed inconclusive elections on Nov. 5. `` The three parties agreed to support a government whose life term will last until mid-April,'' conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> told a news conference. The decision to hold general elections in April follows four rounds of talks between conservative, socialist and communist leaders with President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said the interim administration will be headed by <PERSON> Xenophon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON>, an economist and former governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION>. Zolotas is not a member of Parliament. The government will include members of all parties and also non-political personalities, <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said, but composition of the Cabinet has not been decided. He said the administration's first tasks will be to deal with economic problems and negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on whether to renew an agreement for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> looks forward to working with the new government and will raise the question of the status of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases once a Cabinet is formed. It issued a statement saying, `` We believe it is in the interest of both countries to continue a strong bilateral security relationship. We will look for a mutually satisfactory way to do so.'' Talks between the party leaders had been deadlocked over a demand by former socialist Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> that the electoral system be changed. His proposed change involving the proportional representation system would have made it even more difficult for any party to win a majority in the 300-member unicameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Under the present system if one party receives at least 47 percent of the vote it can govern alone. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 46 percent of the vote and 148 parliamentary seats in November, rejected the proposal. He said the April elections will be conducted under the present electoral system.'' <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> governed for eight years until the formation of a conservative-communist alliance in June after elections that also failed to give any party a majority. His party won 128 seats in November and the communist-led <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and Progress led by <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> won 21. Two seats went to independents and one to an environmentalist. <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON>, 85, headed the nation's central bank for almost 20 years while conservatives were in power. The premier-designate is not a member of any political party and has never run for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON> served as <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION> governor from 1955-67 and from 1974-81. He acquired a reputation as a pragmatist for maintaining tight economic policies to offset <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s trade deficit. A socialist party official who was close to the negotiations that produced the compromise agreement said <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON> was proposed by <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> and `` accepted without any objections.''

 White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said he hopes Tuesday's deficit reduction agreement means more cooperation than confrontation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next year on budget issues. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said the deficit cutting package was made possible by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s insistence that he was willing to accept across-the-board spending cuts rather than tolerate a 1990 budget which met the Gramm-Rudman deficit targets through accounting gimmicks. The $ 14.7 billion deficit cutting package was agreed to in post-midnight negotiations as members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rushed to complete their work before the Thanksgiving holidays. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said the measure was `` far better than anyone thought likely'' on Nov. 2 when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued his ultimatum that he wanted to see at least $ 14 billion in real deficit reductions or he was prepared to live with across-the-board spending cuts. The director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, however, warned members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to try to make changes in the agreement in passing the necessary implementing legislation. He said any such changes could still prompt a presidential veto. `` If they do not follow the agreement, then there will not be a deal,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said in a meeting with reporters. The deficit-reduction package, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, should get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration back to where they were last spring when both sides reached a much-heralded budget pact. That agreement dissolved into bitter partisan fighting over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts to slash capital gains tax rates. `` This can get us back on a path of bipartisanship and put this recent period of partisan debate behind us,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, adding that the challenge of meeting the deficit-reduction target of $ 64 billion in 1991 was sizable. The administration is preparing its 1991 budget to be submitted in January, but <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> turned aside questions about what will be in that package. He did say the administration would be proposing cuts in entitlement programs to meet the deficit targets. He also said that he would consider increases in alcohol and tobacco taxes among the revenue increases that would be prohibited under the president's no-new taxes campaign pledge. But he added that he does n't drink or smoke and said, `` I do n't believe either of those should be encouraged.'' The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration task force is considering proposals to raise the federal tax on tobacco and liquor and impose new taxes on polluters and use the revenues raised to underwrite the cost to the government of offering individuals new tax breaks to encourage savings. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said he believed that the budget deficit, which totaled $ 152.1 billion in the fiscal year which ended on Sept. 30, had now been stabilized at a sustainable level withthe new deficit cutting agreement for the current fiscal year. `` There is n't the sense of erosion or lack of control that I had in the 1980s,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, referring to his years of service in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The budget deficit hit a record of $ 221.1 billion in 1986.

<TEXT>
 A senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has executed `` probably more than 100'' officers and troops since a failed Oct. 3 coup. `` As a result, there can not be a chivalrous coup d'etat in the future. The next batch of coup plotters wo n't be interested in handing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to us or dispatching him into exile,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has changed the ground rules. So the next coup will be bloody.'' The purge, <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said, amounts to 3 percent of the men in the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>'s comments came a day after his <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> received a closed-door, top-secret briefing from Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had killed `` more than 70 and probably more than 100 officers and men of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Before October, coups in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were essentially bloodless. If you lost a coup, you lost your job _ but not your life. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has changed all that,'' <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said in a statement. The result is that any new coup attempt, `` if successful, will do little that we want except eliminate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, which will probably happen in a manner we do not wish to be associated with,'' <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said. `` Whoever wins lives, and whoever loses will die. That's the game we're in now,'' he said. Intelligence sources have said that, in the wake of the failed coup, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has received congressional clearance for a new covert plan that would spend up to $ 3 million to depose <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The plan would permit aiding coup plotters, even if violence were likely, as long as the plot did not include plans for assassination. A longstanding executive order bars <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operatives from participating in any plot to assassinate a foreign leader. <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said he was satisfied that the likelihood <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could die in a later coup does not necessarily represent an impediment to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement. `` A death involved in a coup is different from an out-and-out assassination attempt,'' he said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s purge has left a `` concentration of thugs'' in the PDF, which lessens the chances that any new coup would lead to a restoration of democracy and elimination of drug trafficking and money laundering, <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said. The coup attempt occurred during <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>'s first week as the new chief of <ORGANIZATION> Southcom </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> was among the harshest congressional critics of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure to give full support to the rebels led by Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>. But after <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>'s briefing, <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said it was clear that the coup attempt was flawed because it was based on the `` irrational premise'' that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would agree to retire to his farm in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and because the rebels would n't turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, would not have restored democracy and probably would have continued <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug operations. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman, Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, said security has been tightened at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense sites in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because of bomb threats. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said that the first such threat was made about a week ago and that the new security steps have been in effect for nearly a week's time. `` It means that they are inspecting cars more carefully, and that some parking lots have been closed if they are within 75 meters of buildings,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel are acting under personnel movement limitations that require them to keep others advised of their movements, to exercise caution and to avoid any known trouble areas, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Refiles Felony Assault Charge Against `Diff'rent Strokes'
Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A felony assault charge was refiled Tuesday against former child television star <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, who was acquitted by a jury earlier this month of more serious charges in the shooting of a drug dealer. Bridges, who faces up to six years in prison if convicted, pleaded innocent to assault with a firearm and remained free on $ 25,000 bail pending a Jan. 25 hearing, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Botula </PERSON> of the district attorney's office. Jurors found Bridges innocent Nov. 7 of attempted murder and the lesser charge of attempted voluntary manslaughter. Two days later, the panel announced it was deadlocked 8-4 in favor of acquitting him on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. The former member of the cast of the series `` Diff ` rent Strokes'' was originally charged with shooting eight bullets into <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Tex'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> and slashing his throat during a Feb. 2 scuffle in a south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> `` crack'' house where cocaine was being <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, 25, survived the attack and testified Bridges was `` based out'' from freebasing or smoking cocaine when the shooting occurred. `` He looked like his eyes were about to jump out of his head,'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> described himself as a bodyguard for the owner of the house where Bridges was living and said Bridges was taking weapons from the house and selling them. Defense attorney <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> maintained throughout the trial that Bridges shot <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> in self-defense. Bridges, 24, who for eight years played actor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> on `` Diff ` rent Strokes,'' testified he became depressed and turned to drugs after the situation comedy was canceled On Nov. 13, <PERSON> Harvie </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON>, 31, who testified that he helped Bridges attack <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, was placed on three years' probation as part of a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors.

<TEXT>
 An official East German newspaper called <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> a secret member of the old guard Tuesday, less than a month before a party congress that is expected to make leadership changes. Calls for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> reunification by protesters in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> added still another dimension to an already volatile and complicated political situation. Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s new government said it was planning `` unpopular measures'' to curb black-market currency trading, which has flourished since the borders with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were opened Nov. 9. A statement by <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> to workers at a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> factory, as reported by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, did not make clear whether there would be an attempt to reduce the number of East Germans traveling to the West. More than 6 million have visited <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The German Democratic Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- can not become a country of currency speculators,'' <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said at the factory. State television said later the new measures were customs controls to be revealed after a government meeting Thursday. The flood of visitors to the West has taken a huge amount of money out of the country, adding to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economic problems. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the West German government said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had rejected the idea of a joint fund to provide citizens with money for travel to the West. Although East Germans now enjoy freedom of travel unthinkable less than a year ago, and have been promised free elections, opposition leaders say that's not enough. Increasingly, the criticism has been aimed at <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, in part because 77-year-old <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the man he replaced Oct. 18, had been his mentor. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, has been dogged by a debate over whether he averted a potential massacre earlier in October by reversing <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s orders to <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> police to shoot pro-democracy protesters if necessary Supporters say he did. Detractors say he reversed the orders only after being persuated by local party officials and church leaders. His support for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in June has been another obstacle in <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to win over a distrustful people. There also have been allegations that he took part in massive election fraud. As Parliament weighs possible criminal charges against <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other members of his inner circle, reform groups emphasize <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> was part of that group. His promises of reform, often expressed in careful generalities, have done little to change that attitude. Tuesday's editions of the official daily <ORGANIZATION> National-Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> reminded its readers the new party chief belonged to the `` leadership body that is now in the cross-fire of criticism.'' `` Egon <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> can not make up lost ground'' unless he answers the criticisms, it said in a commentary. `` The time of glasnost demands honesty from everyone.'' State-run newspapers, which once hewed strictly to the party leadership's line, have reported much more freely in recent weeks, but the <PERSON> National-Zeitung </PERSON>'s criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> was the harshest to date. ADN distributed the commentary after its publication. The conservative, mass-circulation West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> might be ousted in four weeks, which roughly coincides with the party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged that possibility. He told state TV over the weekend: `` Naturally, I want to fight for the changes we've managed so far, but if the party is of another opinion, then they should find another general secretary. A major question is whether a former model of party loyalty can lead <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> through a crisis rooted in the flight of 275,000 people from a nation of 16.5 million and the commitment to reform of millions who stayed home. Opposition groups previously had expressed indifference, even opposition, to calls from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> for German reunification, but some of that changed Monday night when protesters in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> called out, `` We are one people!'' and `` <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> a united fatherland!'' Whether that represents a major shift in position or not, West Germans seized on the chants as growing support for a single German state. `` In the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the calls for a reunification are growing ever louder,'' said <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehe </PERSON>, general secretary of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s party, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's what the demonstration of hundreds of thousands of people showed on Monday evening in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>.''

 Four psychologists who speculated publicly about why <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drank rubbing alcohol have been chastised by a state licensing board which said they may have violated ethical principles. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychologists </ORGANIZATION> last week sent letters to the psychologists criticizing them for comments published Nov. 10 in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s article came after Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a recovering alcoholic who is the wife of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was hospitalized for drinking rubbing alcohol. The article suggested that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> broke down in part because she was carrying all the emotional burdens of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> marriage. It quoted psychologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kantor </PERSON> as recommending the governor resign to give the couple the privacy they need to address their personal problems. If the board files a complaint following a preliminary inquiry, which is under way, the psychologists could be censured or lose their licenses, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said. Dr. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, chairwoman of the board, would only say Tuesday that the letters were letters of inquiry. She would not say whether an investigation was under way. The letters said the psychologists may have violated six ethical principles, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said. One of the psychologists, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltas </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> she was misquoted and had protested to the Globe. The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Maltas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kantor </PERSON> and psychologist <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dym </PERSON> said they believed they were misquoted, misrepresented or quoted out of context in the Nov. 10 article, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said. The fourth psychologist, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, would not say whd a letter from the board but would not say whether she was quoted accurately. Maltas, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Couples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <PERSON> Belmont </PERSON>, said the board's action could damage her 16-year psychology practice. `` I give these kinds of interviews all the time. I consider it my professional responsibility to educate the public,'' <PERSON> Maltas </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm going to be unbelievably careful about who I talk to in the future,'' she said. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dym </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kantor </PERSON> did not return telephone calls Tuesday seeking comment. The order initiating the inquiry did not come from the governor, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Executive Office of Consumer Affairs, which oversees all the state's independent licensing boards. `` No one in this office, the governor's office or the director of the Division of Registration's office had any prior knowledge'' of the inquiry, <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> said. Board member <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said the inquiry was prompted by the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> article, which appeared the same day as a board meeting. After a `` full and lengthy discussion, there was a consensus'' to contact the psychologists about their comments, he said. Globe Managing Editor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvoy </PERSON> said the newspaper stands by the article, and defended the practice of reporters asking experts about current events even though they are not directly involved. `` We report by analogy all the time,'' he said. `` If a major political figure has heart bypass surgery ... certainly a reasonable approach is to go to doctors and ask how the procedure works.'' Under <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, mental-health professionals can comment on psychological problems if they add the disclaimer that they are talking generally and not about a specific person, said Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maltas </PERSON> said she was aware of the guidelines, and had restricted her comments to general issues. In addition to questions about professional ethics, the board's inquiry also raises free-speech issues, said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a prominent First Amendment attorney <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the board's actions give the appearance that the state is trying to quash psychological speculation about the governor's wife, making people think twice before talking to reporters. `` In a situation like this, where the governor and his family are under intense public scrutiny, it's particularly important that state agencies not become involved in making any threats to those who have been a part of the process,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>House Passes Anti-Drug Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Tuesday approved a compromise $ 240 million anti-drug bill that includes new military aid for the three Andean countries that are the major source of cocaine flowing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The bill was approved on a voice vote and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which was expected to approve it and send it to the White House before adjourning for the year. A centerpiece of the measure was $ 125 million in military aid _ including weapons and police training _ to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The aid is intended for units organized specifically for narcotics control, and can be used so long as police forces do not commit gross human rights violations. Another major feature was authorization of $ 115 million for operations of international narcotics control programs through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It continued the requirement that countries be certified as cooperating fully with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug efforts before receiving aid. Under the bill, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials may help in training foreign anti-drug personnel and may accompany them on forays but are barred from direct involvement in arrests in foreign countries. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, at the insistence of Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, dropped from the bill authority to use some money for non-Andean countries that are major drug transit That meant that $ 2.5 million in weaponry and $ 1 million in police training would be lost to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Another change gave more flexibility to the administration to reward new drug eradication or interdiction efforts in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, by waiving repayment of official debts owed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government.

 A former adviser to two secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could safely trim defense spending by $ 145 billion over 10 years and should take such action as part of a `` revolution in military affairs.'' In a 100-page paper to be published next month by the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON> outlines cuts that would reduce the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s current budget of $ 305 billion to $ 160 billion by 1999. He says the cumulative reductions would add up to $ 500 billion in savings. `` A revolution in military affairs could be in the making at least in part because of the economic distress in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> and the changes in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership,'' <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> lecturer and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> veteran, writes. `` The revolution will not progress much further without initiatives and cooperation by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON> argues that proposals by Soviet officials to cut their defense budget `` are worth encouraging, not by increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending and the modernization of its forces, but by relaxing to some degree the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. effort.'' <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON> is a non-resident senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the liberal-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. He is a professor emeritus at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and has served as a consultant to former Secretaries of Defense <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> administrations and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. Draft copies of his report began circulating as <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources said that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was studying suggestions for sweeping changes, including cutting 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers, getting rid of 100 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and closing at least a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is considering a budget plan for the 1991 fiscal year that could cut $ 20 billion from the projected $ 317 billion spending level. The Pentagon is expected to submit its 1991 spending projection to the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> by Dec. 8, the official said. <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON> said a copy of his study, with its call for much deeper cuts, was sent to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>. In the first five years alone, it calls for cutting one active-duty <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> division in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while keeping forces at their present level in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until a conventional-forces reduction agreement is signed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It also recommends scaling back the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s B-2 `` stealth'' bomber force to 13 planes and canceling the C-17 cargo plane. For the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, it proposes the elimination of two of the 14 aircraft carrier battle groups. <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON> also proposed canceling the MX Rail Garrison strategic missile and the smaller Midgetman missile and focusing on a strategic deterrent based on Trident ballistic missile submarines. <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON> argued that such reductions could be made without sacrificing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> global commitments or undermining arms control talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Air Force Concludes Powerful Radar Threatens All Aircraft At Georgia
Base</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that a powerful radar system built to detect submarine-launched missiles off the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> poses a potential risk to virtually all military aircraft landing at <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The conclusion was disclosed Tuesday in a letter made public by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman who last year asked the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to assess the danger posed to aircraft by the PAVE PAWS radar installation two miles south of the Robins airfield PAVE PAWS stands for Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning System. The 10-story, pyramid shaped installation at <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, one of four such facilities nationwide, consists of thousands of computer-directed antennas that can scan 240 degrees for 3,000 miles. The radar reportedly can identify an object the size of a basketball 1,500 miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged in January that since 1987, it has been turning off the north face of the radar every time a plane carrying an externally mounted electroexplosive device -LRB- EED -RRB- lands at Robins. The shut-downs are designed to keep the radar's electromagnetic radiation from accidentally detonating the EEDs, the tiny explosive charges that are used, among other things, to trigger weapons systems and ejection seats, or jettison bombs and fuel tanks. The explosive devices normally are detonated by an electrical circuit, but they also can be set off high levels of electromagnetic energy from such sources as radio waves, radar emissions, static electricity and lightning. In the letter to <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> review of the problem has concluded that the radar poses a potential risk to aircraft with internal EEDs, such as those used to power ejection seats, as well as to aircraft with the devices mounted externally. `` It would look like most aircraft would probably have internal EEDs of one sort or another,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purka </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Purka </PERSON> said the north face of the radar now is turned off when any plane enters the one-nautical mile restricted zone around the facility. <PERSON> Purka </PERSON> said there was `` no incident that triggered'' the decision to begin shutting down the radar for some planes. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> the shut-down procedures `` will have a minimal impact'' on missile warning operations. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> convened a panel of senior generals in January to develop a permanent solution to the problem. The panel was supposed to have finished its work by June, but <PERSON> Purka </PERSON> said Tuesday the group recommended this month that the temporary shutdown procedures remain in effect for another year while further study is done.

 A young woman lost for two weeks in rugged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> wilderness said Tuesday she felt desperate at times but never thought she would die. <PERSON> Eloise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, 22, six months out of <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, who held a news conference outside her parents' home, said she went backpacking in the isolated area to try to figure out where to go with her life next. She said she left the main trail and became lost after she sensed she was being followed by men. `` I could tell there was no good intent involved,'' she said but added there was no clear indication they meant her harm. `` I used instinct, like a deer,'' she said, adding that the men carried walkie-talkies and that she could hear them discussing her. On Nov. 4 she signed the wilderness book at the beginning of the 43-mile Foothills Trail at Table Rock State Park, putting down the names of <PERSON> Eloise </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, an experienced backpacker, said Tuesday she put down a second name so as not to advertise that she was in the woods alone. She said she left the trail the following Tuesday. When she did n't complete the hike as expected, rescuers on Sunday, Nov. 12, launched a search involving more than 100 people. She was found Monday by a deer hunter, two days after the search for her had been called off. `` I was kind of delirious at that point,'' she said earlier in an interview with the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> newspaper. `` I said, ` I do n't know if I can trust you.''' The hunter, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, took her to his vehicle and got help. `` I knew I was not going to die,'' she said Tuesday. `` There were times when I felt desperation. I felt no hope sometimes. But it was my life and nobody was going to take it away from me,'' she said. She said she ditched her pack and kept only some dried apples to eat. `` I felt I had to let go of my belongings to survive, and run as far and as fast as I could,'' she said. She said she saw rescue helicopters overhead but did n't build a fire to attract attention because it might have given her away to the men she believed were chasing her. `` I was n't hungry,'' she said. `` It did n't matter. I was too scared and cold to be hungry.'' Miss <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> said she found a cache of doughnuts and pound cake hanging from a tree and sought shelter from rain in a burned-out truck. She had infected blisters on both feet and was carried to and from her news conference Tuesday. She said she learned from the ordeal that `` life is valuable and a lot of people care about me. Everything will be a little more important now.''

 A film and theater director who opposes censorship was named culture minister Tuesday by the Soviet legislature, which had rejected Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s nominee. `` The ministry should not allow or ban; it should expand the possibilities of workers in art,'' the new minister, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON>, was quoted as saying by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. Only eight votes were cast against <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON> in the 542-seat Supreme Soviet legislature, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. Last summer, the lawmakers refused to reconfirm <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON> as culture minister, as <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> had wanted, and the post was vacant until <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON> was elected. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that in his statement to the legislature, <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON> said he will seek to create a climate fostering creativity, provide legal protection against officialdom and dismantle restrictions on creative work. For the past two years, the 48-year-old <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON> has served as chief director of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Taganka Theater.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> asked for an official report on alleged killings by police death squads, but newspapers demanded Tuesday that an independent inquiry be conducted. <PERSON> Casper </PERSON> <PERSON> Venter </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, said the president told Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> last week to provide a `` detailed, in-depth'' report on the allegations that opponents of the government have been assassinated. `` This may satisfy the president, but it will not satisfy anyone else,'' said The Star, the nation's largest daily. Its editorial was one of many demanding an inquiry by someone outside the official establishment. `` Only a full-scale, open judicial inquiry can clear the air,'' said the paper, which often opposes the government. `` Without it, the stain on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will be indelible.'' Three former policemen, including a white captain, have said they took part in the killings on orders from superiors. A former police commissioner, a ranking officer investigating the bombing of an anti-apartheid church organization and other high officers still in service were named by former Capt. <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON> during an interview in <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> last week, after he left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It is neither right, nor fair to the police, to appoint the head of the -LRB- internal affairs division -RRB- to investigate such horrendous and politically explosive allegations against his own colleagues,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. That official and a provincial attorney general were appointed to investigate when the charges first arose in an affidavit by a black former security policeman. <PERSON> Butane </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofomela </PERSON>, scheduled to hang Oct. 20 for the murder of a white farmer in a case with no apparent political overtones, summoned lawyers the night before and signed a statement that <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON> was his superior in a death squad that killed political activists, prisoners and <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. He has been granted a stay of execution while his allegations are checked. Investigators did not get in touch with <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON>, who was given a medical discharge from the police in 1986, and he left the country more than two weeks later. Last weekend, newspapers quoted black former policeman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tshikalange </PERSON> as saying he also was part of a police death squad and had left the country. `` It is essential that the truth comes to light. There should not be a scrap of suspicion about the police being neutral in its duty of keeping law and order,'' said <PERSON> Die </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, an Afrikaans language paper that supports the government. Business Day, the leading financial daily, commented: `` The credibility of the police has simply collapsed. The general public reaction to the ... allegations has been that, given the secrecy in which the police operate and the accumulation of unsolved murder cases in which the victims have been opponents of the government, an assassination squad might well have existed.'' Nofomela's statement focused mainly on the killing in 1982 of <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> <PERSON> Mxenge </PERSON>, a black lawyer and civil rights activist He and <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mxenge </PERSON> was stabbed to death in an attack made to look like a robbery, his dogs were poisoned and his car was taken away and burned. In parts of the statement obtained Tuesday by the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nofomela </ORGANIZATION> said a radio-tape deck was removed from <PERSON> Mxenge </PERSON>'s car before it was destroyed and was installed in a police vehicle used by Brig. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoon </PERSON>. Both Nofomela and <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schoon </PERSON> ordered the killing, and <PERSON> Nofomela </PERSON> said the brigadier supervised several squads that carried out assassinations and other crimes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and neighboring countries. <PERSON> Schoon </PERSON> has refused to talk to the press. Police headquarters in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> issued a statement Tuesday saying his retirement Oct. 31 had been planned since July and was not related to the allegations. Dozens of killings of anti-apartheid activists in the 1980s remain unsolved and human rights groups have said for years they believed security forces were responsible.

<HEAD>Missionary Denounces U.S., Canadian Aid to Rightist Gov't</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Lutheran minister on Tuesday criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where he directed an orphanage until his arrest by Salvadoran security forces. The Rev. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> said he planned a speaking tour to address the suffering of many Salvadorans, who resent the foreign assistance to the rightist government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. `` Certainly the preference there would be that it -LRB- aid -RRB- be discontinued and that the Salvadorans be allowed to resolve their problems without what they see as that kind of interference,'' Rude told a news conference hours after his return to <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided $ 3.5 billion in aid to battle the decade-old insurgency, and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has a $ 12 million program that aids farmers. Rude, 33, worked in an orphanage outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for a year and was also caring for people wounded or displaced by fighting between government troops and leftist rebels. He was among a dozen Lutheran missionaries arrested Thursday by Salvadoran security forces in a government crackdown on people suspected of leftist sympathies. The arrests came hours after six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter were mutilated and slain. Roman Catholic officials blamed right-wing death squads, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it would pressure <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to fully investigate the slayings. The slight Lutheran minister spent a night blindfolded and handcuffed in a jail before his release. He returned to <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> late Monday to the cheers of friends and family. Rude, who was originally scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> in December, said he will go on a speaking tour to tell the stories that are not getting out. `` I feel disconnected. Even while I was there listening to news reports from other parts of the world over shortwave I realized that a lot of the information going out was n't necessarily the way we were experiencing it.'' The minister said he was concerned Canadian aid was not being distributed properly. `` There is some potential for the aid to be used in positive ways, but I think if it were channelled more directly through churches it could be used in a better way than it is being used,'' he said. Since 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has sent more than $ 12 million to the country in fertilizer that is sold by a local bank on the open market. The proceeds are used for special projects. `` I feel the aid we offer as a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government _ even though it's not directed through the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government _ does offer some legitimacy to the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> which can be interpreted in the wrong way.'' More than 1,000 people have died since the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> launched a nationwide offensive Nov. 11. At least 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the insurgency.

<TEXT>
 About 55 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers are based in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, limited in number by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and forbidden from firing unless they are fired upon. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source said the military men trapped in a guerrilla attack on the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel on Tuesday were not part of the adviser group, but were on a two-week training mission and had been due to leave Tuesday. The source, who declined to be further identified, would not say how large the group was, where it was based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or its specific mission. The limit on advisers was set in 1980, a year before the first ones arrived, to avoid the appearance of the type of military buildup that occurred in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But officials say the number is often larger because rotations overlap and the advisers are joined by logistical and administrative support. The advisers come to train the Salvadoran armed forces to battle guerrillas of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. They are assigned to each of the six <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> military bases and other major installations. Others work with the navy, air force, joint chiefs of staff or at a military training school, using both classroom work and military exercises. The advisers train Salvadoran soldiers in patrolling, counterinsurgency techniques and other tactics in a program that draws from courses in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The rules of engagement for the Americans bar them from entering zones where combat is likely or from taking part in patrols. But if fired upon, they can fire back, as at least one did in a Sept. 13, 1988, guerrilla attack on <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION>, the 4th army brigade headquarters in northern <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province. Sgt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronius </PERSON> was killed in a March 1987 attack at <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION>, the only <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier to die in combat in the 10-year-old Salvadoran war. Eleven other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel have been killed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, five in shootings and six in a helicopter crash.

 Congressional passage of a deficit reduction package is expected to force a 1.5 percent budget cut on defense spending for this fiscal year, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Tuesday the precise effect is unclear. `` What that translates into in terms of people, and systems ... we are not prepared to say,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. While saying that the impact could be `` $ 6 or $ 7 billion,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> added that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials are not yet able to estimate the exact magnitude of the cuts under the complicated features of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law. The figure is widely expected to be at least several billion dollars, at least. Although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 286 billion defense budget for the 1990 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not yet signed it into law. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the impact of the cuts, because different rules may apply to various <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> accounts under the budget reduction law. `` It's very hard to know precisely what the impact would be. But we think it would be about a 1.5 percent recutive for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over four months,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Had the terms of the Gramm-Rudman law been fully enforced over a year's time defense programs would have to be pared by $ 8 billion, or half the $ 16 billion spending reductions the law would have automatically imposed on most federal programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stated repeatedly in recent weeks that he preferred retaining the across-the-board cuts for a full year to accepting congressional efforts to reduce the deficit, which he said contained phony savings. Pentagon officials had warned of severe cutbacks in military personnel and weapons acquisition if the Gramm-Rudman cuts had been left in place the entire year. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, lawmakers ran into last-minute delays in beginning debate on the $ 14.7 billion budget-cutting bill for the current fiscal year. The bill relies heavily on across-the-board cuts triggered last month by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, a mechanism designed to shrink federal spending. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and his top aides are also in the final stages of `` putting together some final numbers'' for the department's 1991 fiscal year budget. Department sources said the secretary is considering a cut ranging from $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion for the next year, bringing the level down to the range of around $ 297 billion. The spokesman refused to confirm those figures, saying with a laugh, `` I've heard numbers lower and I've heard nubmers higher.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had also spent part of the day discussing with the service chiefs their suggestions for the long-term cuts for the years 1992-94, which have been reported to be in the range of $ 180 billion. The spokesman said that no decisions have been made on those cuts, but that the talks have been `` a good starting point.''

<HEAD>Licensing Board Blasts Shannon, Stands By Seabrook Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal panel Tuesday accused <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> of unfairly delaying the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, nuclear power plant and reaffirmed its view that evacuation plans for nearby residents are adequate. The Atomic Safety and <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, in a 41-page memo dated Monday and made public Tuesday, said concerns raised by a higher-level regulatory board should not prevent <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> from getting a full-power operating license. Using unusually harsh language, the licensing board said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> had raised `` the specter of the deplored ` endless loop of litigation,''' in opposing <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> even though <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is entitled to a license. `` The attorney general of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is carrying out his announced strategy of filing contentions at every opportunity,'' the board wrote, adding that <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s `` large staff of assistants with their fecund word processors can produce motions for renewed litigation faster than the board and parties can deal with them.'' If the practice is allowed to continue, the board wrote, `` there is no hope for the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> despite applicants' fairly won victory.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s top deputy handling the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> issue, said the licensing board's decision was based on impatience, not law. `` The thrust of the decision is ` We're tired of this litigation.' There's no legal substance to their arguments,'' <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> said. `` They're trying to railroad this thing through.'' The memo comes a week after the board touched off a furor among <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> opponents by ruling that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> should be granted a full-power license despite concerns raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> called the ruling `` lawless.''

<HEAD>Snow Storm Over New England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A powerful storm system raked parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with high wind, low temperatures and heavy snow Tuesday, a day after it pushed a line of damaging thunderstorms across much of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. But temperatures hit record highs on the southern and central Plains. Wind blowing at 30 to 50 mph, with gusts to 58 mph, caused considerable blowing and drifting of snow in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, along with subzero wind chill readings. And a gale warning extended all the way southward along the coast to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. By midday, the storm had dumped 17 inches of snow at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, with 16 inches at the <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> and 12 inches at <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Rumford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, got 3 inches of snow during the six-hour period up to 1 p.m. EST. The high wind in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> downed trees and power lines in some areas. Outside <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, wind gusted to 54 mph at <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, during the morning and to 55 mph at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The storm, centered off the coast of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> by afternoon, produced severe thunderstorms which raked <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area with high wind Monday. The storm continued to produce strong wind Tuesday as far south as the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> and as far west as <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. That wind produced snow squalls around the lower <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region, with heavy snow reported in northeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where the towns of <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> had received 5 inches of snow from late Monday to midday Tuesday. Elsewhere, an upper level weather disturbance moving southeastward out of eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> produced light snow across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, with up to 4 inches possible in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> by Wednesday morning. A few light showers were scattered from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to north-central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Unseasonably high temperatures were over parts of the southern and central high Plains, with readings in the 70s across much of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and in the 50s and 60s to the north. <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, tied its record of 64 degrees; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, hit a record 70; <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, tied its record of 81; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, warmed to a record 83.

<HEAD>Safety Groups Say Makers Lax on Air Bag Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three auto safety groups accused the federal government Tuesday of failing to promote and enforce air bag rules, but a government highway safety spokesman said car passenger protection is its top priority. Public Citizen, the Center for <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> also issued a `` report card'' on air bags, giving failing grades to all but four auto manufacturers for laxity in installation of the passenger-protection devices. A <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> woman, appearing at a news conference with the coalition of safety and consumer groups, said she survived a 110 mph head-on collision because an air bag popped out of her steering wheel. The groups estimate that nearly one-third of the 10 million 1990 cars sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be equipped with driver's - side air bags, compared to about 400,000 of the A new safety administration rule requires either a driver's air bag or lap and shoulder belts that automatically encircle both front-seat occupants in all 1990-model cars. `` <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s engine seems to be stuck in neutral on air bags,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, head of Public Citizen. She said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which she once headed, needs to promote air bags and closely monitor air bag use to perfect the several systems that are being installed in new cars. Ms. <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON> said the agency should conduct its crash tests at higher speeds and upgrade its standards to mandate air bags for small vans as well as cars. `` We are dumbfounded and mystified by her criticism,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCahill </PERSON>. He said the agency has made the promotion of all types of occupant protection its `` number one priority.'' <PERSON> McCahill </PERSON> said the agency's decision to allow manufacturers the option of installing air bags on the driver's side in combination with automatic belts on the passenger side initially has accelerated the program. Eventually, passenger-side air bags will also be required, he said. `` It's truly good to be here, literally,'' said <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kilmarnock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who said she could not remember what happened after a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> station wagon crossed into her lane on Sept. 22, 1988, and smashed head-on into her car. Both vehicles were going 55 mph, putting the force of the impact at 110 mph. Showing no sign of her injuries, Mrs. <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said she suffered 36 broken bones, but the air bag prevented her from slamming into the steering wheel and dashboard of her new <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> LeBaron convertible. The driver of the other car was killed. `` Everything around the air bag seemed to be broken,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said she planned to buy another LeBaron convertible with an airbag. The auto safety groups gave <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the highest score on its air bag `` report card'' of the 12 major manufacturers selling cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, followed by Mercedes. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> tied for third place. All other automakers `` failed,'' said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> of the Center for Auto Safety. General Motors ranked 5th. Manufacturers ranking at the bottom, in order after <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, were <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said in a statement that the company expects to be the largest producer of cars with air bags by 1994, with plans for more driver's - side air bags in 1991 and passenger-side bags in some `` <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has taken great care in designing its air bag system,'' <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said. `` As a result, we believe our system supplies superior supplemental protection for our customers.'' He cautioned, along with the safety groups, that lap-shoulder belts always should be used, even in cars with air bags. The groups said the rankings were based on the number of 1990 models equipped with the safety devices as standard equipment, plans for future installation of air bags, protection devices used in all seating positions of cars, information provided to dealers and the contents of company ads. <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> said two <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> dealers told consumer surveyors that air bags might blow up in the driver's face, which he said is `` a stunning piece of misinformation.'' A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, said she had never heard of such a claim being made by <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> dealers. `` We would not be putting air bags in our cars if they were not considered safe,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> offers air bags only in its top-line Legends but plans to expand their use to other models, Ms. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said.

 The White House hinted broadly Tuesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military force might be used to assist Americans trapped in a hotel seized by by leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was `` a tough situation.'' `` The president believes very strongly in our responsibility to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens,'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers were among the Americans and other foreigners that the rebels said they `` captured'' at a luxury hotel in northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. However, there was some doubt about the guerrillas' claims. At least six armed military men, believed to be the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers, were seen by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter barricaded on the fourth floor of the hotel. They were brandishing M-16 rifles. Guerrillas and an unknown number of guests were on the fifth floor and guerrillas on the third floor. One of the Americans told reporters in the hotel that he and his companions were not hostages, but could not leave. `` We're here because we feel we ca n't leave safely,'' he said. One of the military men said they did not fire at the rebels because they were not shot at. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to say what steps were being considered but added, `` We are making plans as necessary, and we feel we have a very specific responsibility in this area.'' He said no options _ including military ones _ were being ruled out. `` It's a tough situation there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told congressional leaders summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to discuss his summit next week with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Afterward, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said, `` If diplomatic notes and representations wo n't get them free, then we must do what we must do That would include in my book military action, but I'm just speaking for myself. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not discuss military options. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens not to travel to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and urged Americans already there to register with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Pentagon was making preparations to send `` intelligence and tactical assistance'' to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He declined to elaborate on the number of men, the equipment they would carry or from where they would travel. He later said special operation forces were put on a heightened alert. `` Although always on alert for this type of situation, their status has been raised,'' he said. The source said any involvement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel depended on a request for assistance from Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, followed by the final go-ahead from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Comparing the holding of the four military advisers to the murder of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said: `` We're not going to get another bloody eye. Not this time, not again.'' The source said military strategists did not rule out direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention but said they would rather see Salvadoran troops acting on the advice of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers. As recently as Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirmed his administration's strong support for the right-wing government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> against the guerrillas The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided about $ 3.5 billion in the past 10 years to oppose the insurgency with weapons and other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was briefed several times during the day on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> by top military and foreign policy advisers. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said a group of officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> met in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> situation room to monitor events. The panel, known as the deputies' committee, was formed to improve coordination in the aftermath of the abortive coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said no negotiations were under consideration with the rebels, whom she called `` terrorists, pure and simple.'' She said about a dozen of the rebels, deliberately targeting civilians, had entered the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel shortly before dawn. They were later reinforced by up to 150 guerrillas, some of them set up as snipers in the area, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. Although the hotel is called the Sheraton, the U.S.-based hotel chain said it sold its interest several years ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the Salvadoran army had surrounded the hotel. She described the situation as `` very fluid and dangerous'' and in an ambiguous warning to the rebels, declared: `` We will not speculate on the steps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government might take.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at the White House that the rebels had `` embarked on a despicable road of violence by threatening citizens, Americans and innocent citizens of all nations who may be in their path.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands committed to the people and the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' the spokesman said. Similarly, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` The president believes very strongly in our responsibility to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. But we can not speculate on steps the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or the Salvadoran government might be undertaking or considering at this time.'' `` These Marxist guerrillas have shown their true colors,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` They are attacking defenseless citizens in a civilian hotel and using the surrounding neighborhood of defenseless Salvadoran citizens as a shield against the government forces.'' The rebels launched an offensive a little more than a week ago, occupying poor and working-class neighborhoods in the vicinity of the capital. There were indications on Monday that their offensive had subsided under pressure of strong air and ground attacks by government forces. However, the seizure of the Sheraton indicated a new show of strength by the guerrillas.

 The Pentagon announced on Tuesday it took two steps to help control the spread of ballistic missile technology, including tightening oversight of foreign and domestic manufacturers of missile parts that deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. The actions are designed to help curb the export of sensitive missile technologies to nations such as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said one <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition he not be named. Under the new procedures, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will now require domestic and foreign contracting companies to comply with the laws and regulations of their own government in regard to missile-related export controls, as well as those of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

It gives us more leverage. We'll have the authority now to look at what business they do with other nations, and if we do n't like it, we wo n't do business with them,'' the source said. `` At a minimum, these initiatives will encourage <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> contractors, including their subsidiaries, to act responsibly in missile related exports,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement announcing the steps.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> suggests the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> give up territory gained through a pact with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that would include <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, part of which <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> took from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. In comments from a speech to the 14th Romanian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, published Tuesday, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said the non-aggression pact of 1939 in which <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> divided <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into spheres of influence should be canceled. Among countries and territories assigned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics _ <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> _ and <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION>, Romanian until 1940 and now part of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also absorbed the Baltic states in 1940. <PERSON> Ceausecu </PERSON>, a Communist autocrat in his own country and a maverick in the Soviet bloc, told the party congress: `` First of all, a clear, unequivocal stand of condemnation and cancellation must be taken on all the accords concluded with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> ... to eliminate all the consequences of those accords and dictates.'' He did not go into detail, but his allusion to Hitler-Stalin pact was clear. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s suggestion comes at a time of political and ethnic turmoil in many parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and the Baltic republics. In the speech, delivered Monday to the opening session of the congress, the Romanian leader also rejected political and economic liberalization of the kind sweeping through the Soviet bloc. His contempt for reform was contained in a prepared text of the speech, which lasted more than five hours. He departed from the text to comment on the 1939 treaty. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s official media published their first reports of unrest in the <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, where 60 percent of the people are ethnic Romanians. Scinteia, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, carried a dispatch Tuesday from the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that described a crackdown on ethnic Romanian demonstrators in the city of <LOCATION> Kishinve </LOCATION> several days earlier. A Western diplomat said privately <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was showing increased interest recently in its former territory, which officials still call <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION>. Although regaining the territory `` may be part of his vision,'' the diplomat said, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s primary purpose probably was to demonstrate independence of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Romanian officials, speaking anonymously for fear of retribution, agreed that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> appeared to be making more of a political statement than a demand for the return of lost territory.

<TEXT>
 A majority of the American public closely followed news of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake and the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall but paid little attention to other major news events in the past month, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> publishing company. The destruction caused by the Oct. 17 earthquake aroused the close attention of 73 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said. In the four-year history of the survey, it said, that level of interest was exceeded only by the 80 percent who closely followed the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986. Half the American public closely followed the news of the breaching of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, but comparatively little interest was shown in the resumption of fighting in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the World Series or state and local elections, according to the Times Mirror News Interest Index for November. Only 13 percent of those surveyed said they followed the Nicaraguan story or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> election coverage closely, while 23 percent said they paid close attention to the World Series. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said 44 percent of those surveyed rated coverage of the earthquake and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall stories as excellent. Typically, about 20 percent give the press an excellent rating for its coverage of a national news story. The survey results were based on telephone interviews with 1,230 adults aged 18 or older during the Nov. 9-12 period. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said results based on the total sample had a margin of error of three percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said interest in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> quake was high in all regions of the country and among all types of Americans. Nearly two-thirds of people under 30, who usually are least interested in all kinds of news, said they followed quake coverage closely.

 Peace talks between the Nicaraguan government and the Contra rebels were suspended Tuesday night after the two sides were unable to agree on terms for a cease-fire. Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told reporters his government plans to call for an emergency meeting of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents to decide on next steps. The chief Contra negotiator, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, expressed regret over the breakdown and he blamed the Sandinista negotiators. He said the rebel side had made flexible proposals and was willing to continue the talks. The talks collapsed when the Contras refused a Sandinista demand that they agree to a partial withdrawal of their forces to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON>, an American member of the Sandinista negotiating team. The Contras refused to go beyond a promise not to infiltrate any more forces from the units based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the Contra refusal to withdraw troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> `` shows they are not interested in peace.'' He also criticized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for doing `` absolutely nothing'' to facilitate an agreement. Mediators from the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying they will remain in contact with both sides for the purpose of reconvening the discussions `` at the earliest date.'' Hours earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> unveiled a comprehensive cease-fire proposal that omitted a previous demand for the withdrawal of all Contra forces from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and called instead for a pullback of 2,300 insurgents. The new proposal, outlined by <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> at a news conference, would establish corridors through which the retreating Contras would return safely to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The process would be verified by 620 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers who are scheduled to take up duties in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> shortly. Under the proposal, both sides would agree to cease all military operations inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> until Dec. 31. `` If the Contras do not accept the proposal, they have no interest in a cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers will be comprised of West Germans, Spaniards and Canadians. In addition to monitoring the cease-fire, they also are entrusted with ensuring that the territory of one Central American county is not used to launch subversive activities in another. The negotiations began on Nov. 9 and were aimed at restoring the cease-fire that President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suspended eight days earlier after alleging that the rebels had engaged in widespread terrorist activities. As of Monday, the negotiators had met eight times, with mediators from the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> prodding the two sides toward agreement. The Contras have called for a cease-fire in place as an initial step aimed at an overall accommodation between the two sides, culminating in the peaceful rebel reintegration in Nicaraguan society. National elections are set for Feb. 25. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the 2,300 Contras being asked to leave under the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal represent the number of rebels who have infiltrated into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from the Honduran base camps in recent weeks. The Contras maintain that there has been no increase, only a rotation of forces. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said there has been a major infiltration of Contras since early October, raising the total number inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to about 5,000. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> indicated that the proposal was about as far as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> could go in efforts to meet the rebels half way. He noted that the government initially had demanded a complete demobilization of the Contras as the price for a cease-fire but dropped that provision last week. The five Central American presidents called last August for the voluntary demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5. Since that date is no longer feasible, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> plan requests the five presidents to set Dec. 31 as the new target date.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and one of his corporations used to divert arms sale profits pleaded guilty to a felony Tuesday in the Iran-Contra scandal. The Iranian-born <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> admitted that he had helped supplement the salary of ex-White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> by paying for a security fence at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s home with funds from `` the Enterprise,'' the complex of foreign companies <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> operated in the Iran-Contra scandal. <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss company used as a conduit for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale money and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, pleaded guilty to theft of government property, a felony carrying a maximum penalty of up to $ 500,000. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, who faces sentencing Feb. 1, could face up to a year in jail and a $ 100,000 fine. It is illegal to supplement the salaries of government employees. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> initially rejected the proposed plea agreement, calling it a `` charade'' and complaining that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was n't being given an opportunity to recover the diverted money. But after meeting with prosecutors and defense attorneys, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> returned to the courtroom and accepted the pleas, which were accompanied by a plea agreement slightly altered at his request. Outside the courtroom, associate independent counsel <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the plea agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, now a paper company with no assets, does not keep the government from seeking restitution. Some $ 3.8 million from the administration's secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was funneled to the rebel force during a congressional ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras. About $ 8 million from the maze of companies operated by <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and his business partner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> remain frozen in Swiss bank accounts which the two men formerly controlled. The funds came from third-country contributions to the Contras, private fund-raising efforts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the secret arms sales. The plea agreement filed with the court by the government says that from late 1985 to November 1986, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, his business partner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> used their influence `` to generate and divert approxmiately $ 16.2 million ... to Enterprise bank accounts.'' <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> agreed to cooperate with the investigation by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, to testify at pending trials and to supply financial records and other documents. In North's case, the $ 13,000 security fence and other equipment constituted an illegal gratuity and his acceptance of it was one of the three felony counts for which <PERSON> North </PERSON> was convicted. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, answering <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s question `` what was it'' that <PERSON> North </PERSON> got, said the security fence was installed `` for the protection of Col. North ... from terrorist attacks.'' A terrorist organization run by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> had threatened to kill <PERSON> North </PERSON>, acording to congressional testimony. Asked how he concealed the gift, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> said `` By maintaining ... bank accounts in a secret manner.'' <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s other answers were brief `` Yes, your honor'' or `` No, your honor'' responses. In another Iran-Contra development, Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attorneys were granted a two-week delay by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> for consideration of a court challenge to a subpoena asking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to produce documents and testify at the trial of his former national security adviser, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who was North's boss <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attorneys said the subpoena `` raises novel and complex constitutional issues'' about the power of courts over a former chief executive. `` We disagree with'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s characterization of the agreement as a charade, said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. He said negotiations were under way on an unspecified civil matter which could affect restitution to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> will be able to conduct a hearing on restitution and `` whether Lake Resources transferred funds'' to other corporations `` so that someone else could be liable'' for returning the money to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> `` got rid of his assets to keep anybody from finding them,'' complained <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. The judge said, `` I am not anxious to conduct a trial to determine what happened'' to the money and said the plea agreement should answer the questions of `` who diverted the money ... who is responsible.'' `` I am not getting an admission here of anything except 100 bucks,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in regard to the corporate guilty plea. The plea agreement specifies that Lake Resources is charged with converting to its own use property of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> worth more than $ 100. Before meeting privately with prosecutors and defense attorneys, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in court that `` You ca n't fancy-dance through the paragraphs.'' If there is `` a fancy dance,'' he said, `` there is no point in pleading.'' The judge called the proposed agreement `` simply public relations efforts that do n't have any place in a court.'' At <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s request, two paragraphs were dropped from the agreement concerning <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s guilty plea. They would have preserved <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s rights to appeal an adverse decision by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on a motion that has been pending since last June.

 The House gave about 100 Soviet soldiers a standing ovation Tuesday and a congressional tape of upcoming events played show tunes as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> plunged through what it hoped was its last day of business for the year. With enough unresolved business to last until after midnight _ or even next week _ members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were in jovial spirits as they began the day after a late night session Monday. `` Maybe, it's because they're getting a raise,'' said a staff member. The House went into session at 9 a.m., an hour earlier than normal, causing some observers to ask why the lawmakers were pushing themselves so hard. `` Are you kidding?'' responded Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the Rules Committee `` Give these guys a good night's sleep and a strong wind at their back and we'll be here until Christmas. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> slept in, with no floor business until noon. Not many House members showed up for opening formalities, but those who did were studied carefully from the gallery by an impressive contingent of Soviet soldiers, resplendent in their olive and red uniforms. A scene that could n't have been imagined two years ago unfolded as the 12 or so House members recited the Pledge of Allegiance and then turned and applauded the soldiers. The Soviets, members of a military choral group on tour in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, clapped back. `` Forty-five years ago our countries were together against <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>,'' reminded one of the soldiers later as Reps. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., and <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., gave the group a guided tour of the `` It's an exciting time in which we live,'' <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said. `` A hopeful time for our generation and generations to come in terms of de-escalating the tension that has existed between the two greatest military powers of the globe not only to our benefit, but to the benefit of the world.'' A few hours later, an encounter of quite a different nature occurred between several people in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gallery and the lawmakers below. Demonstrators opposed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> shouted slogans from the viewing seats and were dragged from the chamber by Capitol police. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> responded by temporarily closing the gallery to visitors. Three of the protesters were charged with disrupting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and demonstrating within the Capitol. Each charge is punishable by a maximum fine of $ 500 and or six months in jail. The long legislative day required action by both houses on much of the same legislation, including the complicated deficit reduction package. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> stayed in session, taking `` quorum calls'' when it had no business to handle, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recessed periodically through the day while waiting to vote on legislation. At lunch, the House dining room treated members and visitors to a turkey buffet with all the Thanksgiving trimmings. During the morning, C-Span, which broadcasts <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, used the channel that usually carries the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to show the British Parliament in action. That prompted <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., to quip to reporters: `` I know you're going to think they're much more interesting, and much more witty and much more stimulating in every way. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he entertained the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> about a month ago who asked him how many speakers had preceded him. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> replied he was the 49th Speaker of the House. `` He said he was the 634th. They generally date the speakership from 1377,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` And I said, ` Well, that's what we call a putdown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>,' and he said, ` Well, eight of them were beheaded, two of them on the same day.''' <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> staffers, eager to get their bosses out of town, were much gentler in their approach. Show tunes such as `` The Impossible Dream,'' `` One Day More,'' and `` Tonight'' were programmed into the House Republican cloakroom legislative tape of upcoming events. The Democrats' staff members said they were keeping their jokes inside the cloakroom.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Tuesday with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who gave him a piece of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. `` I will treasure this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said the gray block represented `` the thanks of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for their faithfulness, support and steadfastness in bad and good times'' that helped lead to the opening of the wall. The talks between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> focused on the president's Dec. 2-3 meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` indicated they would be talking about <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and other matters of general interest,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said after the meeting that he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were in `` complete agreement'' about the approach to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It is important that the West gives the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies a clear and unambiguous sign that we are aware that the reform process will cause problems ... even of crisis proportions.'' The West, he said, is interested that the reforms proceed in a stable framework and has no intention of trying to take advantage of the situation. `` We will for that reason do nothing that will endanger or disturb this reform process from outside,'' <PERSON> Gencher </PERSON> said. `` We will do everything we can to guarantee stability.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> dismissed reports that West German officials had said that the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had made it impossible to deploy a new generation of short-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed. `` This is a theme to be discussed in'92 as was agreed in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> communique,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told reporters. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said, `` is on the way really to becoming a democratic republic'' if free elections are held next year as proposed. `` It's the result of a very clear policy of the West advocating freedom and democracy all over the <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' After his 15-minute session with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> met with National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> stressed that there should be no fear of possible reunification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It is no cause for anyone to worry if Germans opt for freedom and democracy and if all Germans live in freedom and democracy, but it is an enrichment for the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We want no separate German way, but we want <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> get closer and closer together and thereby bring the Germans closer together.''

 `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> HUD </PERSON>,'' the woman who admitted stealing millions of dollars from the government and giving some of it to the poor, was indicted Tuesday in one of the most prominent cases of the Housing and Urban Development scandal. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> was charged with embezzling $ 5.6 million from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, two counts of making false statements to the federal government and one count of making false statements in connection with a loan application. The indictment sends a `` firm message to those who think it's ` business as usual,' when dealing with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> We have zero tolerance for theft, regardless of the reason or how it is done,'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in a statement issued before a news conference Tuesday afternoon. `` She really gives charity a bad name,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said later. He said stricter standards for more than 100 escrow agents who are empowered to sell <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> property for the government are now required, including bonding and certification. `` This case represents perhaps the largest single theft of government funds ever charged against an individual,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. It is the fourth indictment this year involving the theft of more than $ 1 million from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, although it may not be the largest by the time the government investigation is concluded, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. Despite testimony before a congressional committee that she gave stolen <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to the needy, the government's eight-month probe found that `` the single largest charity by far was herself,'' said <PERSON> Breckinridge </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Government prosecutors declined to say how much of the money their probe found had been given to charity. According to <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON>, about $ 625,000 of the embezzled funds have been recovered by seizing <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>'s home and automobiles. `` I'm not sure there's a whole lot left,'' he said. Evidence presented to a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> allegedly showed that <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, who was entrusted with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds as a private escrow agent, misused government money on several occasions, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said Monday. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>'s attorney, federal public defender <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, were not successful. A receptionist at his office said <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> was in court on an unrelated matter. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>'s testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was among the most dramatic during six months of hearings into allegations of fraud, mismanagement and political favoritism at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. A discrepancy between the $ 5.5 million <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> testified about and the $ 5.6 million mentioned in the indictment could not immediately be resolved. Two weeks after she testified, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> seized her house in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburbs as well as several other properties she said she purchased with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to help charities and homeless families. `` I in no way justify what I have done as being anything less than sin,'' <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, who was dubbed <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> HUD by federal investigators, testified before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee in June. `` I do, regardless of where my life takes me from here, intend to repay in full all monies taken.'' <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> said she was easily able to withhold money from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. Several top officials in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office, to which she reported, were fired because of the <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> case and other alleged mismanagement. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping more than $ 10 million they were supposed to transfer to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. Efforts to indict them and seek restitution are at various stages. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> is the second escrow agent to be indicted. When she lost her house in late June, <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, 46, said she was moving in with her mother in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful; the mother's telephone number is unlisted The indictment charges <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> with embezzling about $ 5.6 million belonging to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> between November 1985 and December 1988; giving false explanations to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for her delay in remitting department funds, and lying about her net worth in an application to the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 150,000 loan. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee have been critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, accusing it of not aggressively pursuing HUD-related crimes. The department's statement announcing the <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> indictment indirectly responded to such criticism, noting that the government had obtained 140 HUD-related convictions nationwide in fiscal 1989 and nearly 600 in the last four years. Most of those cases have involved individuals charged with defrauding <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loan programs. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> critics have said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has shown little zeal for investigating former top agency officials and prominent Republicans who participated in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs found to have been tainted by political influence. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has rejected the criticism as partisan sniping.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday that a 33-year-old quadriplegic has a constitutional right to withdraw from the breathing apparatus that has kept him alive for four years. But the court declined to use the case to set non-judicial guidelines for future cases, suggesting that is a task for the Legislature. The court said in a unanimous opinion that <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McAfee </PERSON>'s right to discontinue the treatment falls under privacy rights guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. Those rights outweigh whatever interests the state has in preserving life, the ruling said. <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> suffered a severe spinal cord injury in a 1985 motorcycle accident which left him a quadriplegic. He is incapable of spontaneous respiration and is dependent upon a ventilator to breathe. <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>, living in an Alabaster, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, nursing home, has said he plans to return to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> sometime after the holiday season to shut off his ventilator. `` He is most gratified that the highest court in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> has affirmed his right to decide his own destiny,'' said <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> `` He is currently reviewing several options which have been offered to him, but he does not necessarily believe that he will change his mind as to the removal of his life support system.'' In September, <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> won a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge's permission to turn off the ventilator himself by activating a timer. But the judge instructed the state to appeal the decision in order to establish non-judicial procedures to guide future cases. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which heard arguments in the case only a week ago, declined to go that far. It noted the existence of a `` living will'' act in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> which allows competent adults to execute documents directing physicians not to use extraordinary procedures to keep them alive if their conditions become terminal. But the court said <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s case does n't fit those conditions. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> might well choose to legislate in this area to provide appropriate non-judicial procedures for competent adult patients who do not have ` terminal conditions' but who wish to exercise their rights to refuse medical treatment by the withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures,'' the court held. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the trial judge that <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> has a right to a sedative to relieve the pain when the ventilator is disconnected. State Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said he would have liked the court to set guidelines but said: `` I'm pleased they affirmed the -LRB- trial court's -RRB- order. ... I'm very pleased for <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Under pressure by thousands of demonstrators for a fifth day, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s premier told opposition leaders Tuesday he favored a role for non-Communists in the government. Dissidents, including banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, addressed a crowd of 150,000 people jamming Wenceslas Square without police interference. An actor later called for the resignations of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders, and demonstrators chanted: `` Punish! Punish! Punish!'' The comments by Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, relayed by participants in the meeting, were a sharp break with current government policy. It was not clear what significance his statements would have because the head of government traditionally has far less power than the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. Party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, in a television appearance Tuesday night, accused the demonstrators of trying to `` disrupt the socialist system'' and `` unleash emotion and passions with unforeseeable consequences.'' Although he said he welcomed `` a dialogue with all who stand for socialism even though they criticize abuses,'' he maintained a hard line, denouncing organizers of the demonstrations and saying the `` cause of the working people and socialism ... is at stake.'' A <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> ally, <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, said in a statement that the opposition was whipping up `` hysteria.'' `` We are calling on the workers of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, the members of the people's militia -LRB- police -RRB- to stand firmly,'' said the statement issued by the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party leadership. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> told a delegation that included opposition leaders he was in favor of a `` different concept of the leading role of the party,'' and favored having non-Communists in the government, according to two members of the group, journalist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Horacek </PERSON> and composer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocab </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s statement about non-Communists in the government was not carried by the CTK state news agency. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> also promised the government would not impose martial law, and he suggested dissidents no longer be persecuted. The opposition members quoted him as saying the government would not rule out talking with Charter 77, Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s oldest human rights group, which authorities previously refused to negotiate with. However, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said, protests must stop and socialism must remain intact. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s hard-line leaders have kept a tight rein on society and rejected the reforms transforming other East bloc societies. The leadership appears to be softening, however, in the face of its biggest government crisis since the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that snuffed out the `` Prague Spring'' reform period. The extent of public discontent was underlined by the huge crowds demonstrating Tuesday and on Monday, when 200,000 marched in the largest demonstration ever. State TV also reported protesters filled the streets of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, but it did not give a crowd estimate. At least 10,000 marched there Monday. On Tuesday, speakers addressed the crowd in Wenceslas Square from the balcony of a state-run newspaper, <PERSON> Svobodne </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON>, which has criticized the government. The Rev. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maly </PERSON>, a dissident, read a message from Czechoslovak Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>: `` We can not wait any longer. We need a democratic government. At this decisive moment, no one must stand aside.'' The crowd later dispersed, still crying, `` Freedom! Freedom!'' Witnesses said police and armored vehicles surrounded the main offices of the federal government, but they did not interfere. Also Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported the general prosecutor of the Czech republic had opened an investigation into the actions of security forces who clubbed and fired tear gas at demonstrators Friday, injuring scores. Dissidents said one student was killed by police in the protest, but the government denied it. Czechoslovak media devoted unusual coverage to Monday's demonstration, and employees of state TV voted to provide time on news broadcasts for opposition opinion, a source said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the most important exponent of reform in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, expressed strong support Tuesday for the changes sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` I think the change is very important, and the importance of the change will be that it will create a better society, a more open society, a more democratic society,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In the meeting with opposition leaders, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said he favored `` having in the federal government people with no membership in a political party and members of other political parties and especially young people,'' <PERSON> Horacek </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Horacek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kocab </PERSON> belong to an organization of intellectuals called Most, which means `` bridge.'' It promotes dialogue between authorities and the opposition. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> also said the government was open to talks and added: `` We do not exclude anybody from the dialogue, including Charter 77.'' `` We must free ourselves from the wrongdoings of the past,'' he was quoted as saying. In its report, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> as saying: `` We shall protect socialism, there can be no discussion about this.'' He said political changes were necessary but `` a dialogue about many serious problems ... can not be sensibly conducted in the street.'' In addition to the representatives of Most, the 10-member delegation included four members of the newly formed Civic Forum umbrella opposition group, as well as members of official Communist organizations. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> walked with delegation members to the meeting but did not take part, officials said. Thousands of students were on strike in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and other cities. At the <ORGANIZATION> DAMU </ORGANIZATION> acting school in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, a center of the strike movement, students displayed six letters from factories in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> supporting their demands for more democracy and an end to police brutality. So far, workers have not been extensively involved in the anti-government protests. There were other signs of protest in the capital, including posters condemning police brutality on shop windows and office buildings.

 A sniper's view of Elm Street beckons the thousands of sightseers trekking to <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> Plaza Wednesday to mark the 26th anniversary of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death. The Sixth Floor Exhibit, a tribute to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s life and a shrine for his death, opened in February amid tears and prayers. It's open for the first time on an assassination anniversary. Until President's Day of this year, the public could not enter the sixth floor of the old school book depository in downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, where it's believed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> fired the shots that killed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. About 15,000 visited on the opening, and about 1,000 people visit the building every day, officials say. The creation of an exhibit or major memorial had been delayed, in part by fears that it would only extend any infamy attached to the city by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death. `` It was a courageous thing for Dallasites to do,'' said <PERSON> Lyndalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which led the drive to open The Sixth Floor. `` This city had to go back to a time when <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> meant assassination.'' For years, sightseers found little to mark the site of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s fatal motorcade through downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> lacked anything explaining <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death in its historic context, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, Sixth Floor director. `` The city has been linked with the assassination by the public throughout the world,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said. `` The city needed to address it and this is what we have done.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the president's brother, opposed the exhibit, saying the family would prefer the public to remember the president's life rather than his death. Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> hopes public approval of the exhibit may change his mind. She has sent him pages of the `` memory book'' signed by visitors. He did not return several calls to his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The cost of a visit to the Sixth Floor is $ 4 to $ 6, with proceeds going to the county. Visitors walk through a maze of interpretive panels with more than 400 photographs. A narrative encompasses <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s life and death. Films include footage of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s motorcade rolling through <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s live broadcast of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> fatally shooting <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> in the basement of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Through glass panels, visitors can see where investigators say <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> perched on boxes, ate his lunch while waiting for the motorcade, and fired his rifle out a corner window on Nov. 22, 1963. The exhibit mentions the controversies over the accuracy of the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the assassination and whether <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> may have had conspirators. Conspiracy theories are addressed more in-depth at the <ORGANIZATION> JFK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assassination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a three-room, privately run exhibit that opened in August a few blocks away. The center is directed by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, whose 1976 book `` Cover-Up,'' suggested the use of a second weapon and a government coverup of the assassination. The center supplements the Sixth Floor, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` People come to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and want to see these spots,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` Their lives were changed by what happened here.''

<TEXT>
 Two federal loans that helped finance a strip club across the river from <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s federal capital, were a mistake that wo n't be repeated, officials said Tuesday. `` An error was made,'' <PERSON> Harvie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andre </PERSON>, minister of regional industrial expansion, said in the House of Commons. `` Procedures are being amended to insure this does n't happen again.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency, made two loans totaling $ 899,000 -LRB- $ 1 million Canadian -RRB- to two businessmen in <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, over 18 months to buy land and a building for the bar, called Le <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION>. `` It's against the bank's policy to finance clubs of that kind,'' spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said by telephone from bank headquarters in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. `` It was an error made at the local level.'' A report Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Radio-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, the French-language service of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, disclosed the loans to <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Frechette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentivoglio </PERSON>. It said they totaled $ 1.1 million, but <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said that was too high and provided the lower figure. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, on the Quebec side of the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, is the site of many office buildings in the national capital district. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Lido </PERSON> is near the Promenade du <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, one of the largest office complexes. <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> said the federal agency's officers in <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> did not tell superiors in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> what the loans were buying. During the Commons debate Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Boudria </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> asked: `` Have n't we had enough of this nonsense? Why does n't the government clean up its act once and for all?'' <PERSON> Frechette </PERSON> operates <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Lido </PERSON> and employs about 20 young women to dance. He said in an interview with <PERSON> Radio-Canada </PERSON> that most afternoon customers were government employees, many of high rank, who took cigarette breaks at the club because smoking was prohibited in government buildings. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s purpose is to make loans and provide management counseling to small and medium-sized businesses. <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said helping finance bars or discotheques would not be against bank policy if they were not of an erotic nature. `` We intend to tighten up the policy and make it clearer,'' he said. `` Senior officials of the bank are going to be looking into the entire process.''

<TEXT>
 Two <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> union activists were murdered in 1981 because a `` vicious thug'' did n't get his way in a union dispute, not because the martial-law government of former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had marked them for death, a defense attorney said Tuesday. The murders of Silme Domingo and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> offices resulted from a dispute over gambling and work assignments in Alaskan fish canneries, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> told a federal court. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> is the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, attorney for the estate of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>. They are among the defendants in a $ 30 million civil lawsuit filed September 1982 that claims the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> government ordered the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> killings because of <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>' anti-Marcos agitation. The trial began Monday and is expected to last three to five weeks. Friends and relatives of the dead men hope to prove before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> that <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> were targeted by a <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> intelligence network that kept track of anti-Marcos dissidents in this country. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> called the murders an `` undeniable, terrible fact,'' but added: `` Nothing was going on in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> that had anything to do with Filipino politics that could ever rise to the level ... to cause the deaths of Mr. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and Mr. Viernes.'' `` No matter how many witnesses, no matter how many self-styled experts are called to testify about the politics of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, there will be no evidence of any link, any relation, any connection, between what these politics were and the deaths of Mr. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said. A jury of eight, including two alternates, is hearing the case against the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> will judge liability of the other defendants. At the original criminal trial, at which three men were convicted and given life prison sentences, prosecutors said the murders occurred because <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> were union reformers working to eliminate gambling in the canneries. That, <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said, is the accurate motive in the case. Six days before the 1981 murders, <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> argued with one of those convicted, <PERSON> Fortunato </PERSON> <PERSON> Dictado </PERSON> about dispatching gang members to work in the canneries. Evidence will show that <PERSON> Dictado </PERSON> muttered, `` I'm going to get rid of you,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said. The motive, <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said, was simply `` the demands of a vicious thug whose demands were not met when he wanted them to be met'' by <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> died, <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said, `` because he happened to be there.'' `` This was a -LRB- union -RRB- local that had suffered from the ravages ... of bribes and kickbacks in order to get jobs, where violence and thuggery were the order of the day,'' he said. On Monday, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, an attorney for the plaintiffs, argued that evidence will show that the union-dispute motive was only a cover for the men being marked for death by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' intelligence network. Jailing and killing dissidents or causing them to disappear were weapons in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' anti-opponent arsenal before his government was toppled in 1986, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said.

 The state prison system must accept inmates who have been sentenced to state prison but are being held in local jails because of prison overcrowding, a judge ruled Tuesday. State District Judge <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> also said the state must pay the counties for housing and feeding the inmates. Numerous counties have complained that they are being forced to house inmates who ca n't immediately enter state prisons because of a federal court ordering limiting inmate population. Twelve counties sued the state in an effort to force the transfer of an estimated 6,000 felons from their jails. Statewide, an estimated 12,000 inmates have been sentenced to state prison but are being held in local jails because the prison system has delayed accepting them. Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said the state would appeal. `` There is just not enough room in the inn,'' <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't violate the federal court order and take additional prisoners into the Department of Corrections.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> did not specify how much the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> should pay the counties for housing the state prisoners. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, representing 11 counties in the lawsuit, said the counties want compensation because the state neglected its duty. She said each inmate costs the state $ 40 a day to maintain. At that rate, the cost for 6,000 inmates in the 12 counties could be more than $ 87 million a year. <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> urged Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> to allow the current special legislative session to consider payments to counties. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> had no immediate comment on the ruling or <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>'s suggestion. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said there are many measures that the state could use to take the prisoners off the counties' hands. `` Such other methods include contracting with private vendors, the federal government, and local government, and greater use of the Prison Management Act ... furloughs and ` good time','' he wrote.

<HEAD>Former Spokeswoman Says Keating Directed Misleading News Release</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says company Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> personally directed preparation of a press release saying the sale of the company's troubled <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> was imminent when it really was n't <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> public relations executive, said Tuesday she wrote the release regarding the proposed sale of the subsidiary at <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s direction. `` He was concerned about the publicity, and the stock was falling and he asked me for advice,'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Savings </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was taken over by federal regulators last April. Its failure, which could end up costing taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion, and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> have been the subject of Congressional hearings and a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigation. The Feb. 9 press release Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> discussed was distributed the day after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell 87 cents, to $ 5.50 a share. Market observers blamed the slide on rumors that <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>' proposed ale to a group of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investors had hit snags and that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was in financial trouble. Following American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that the sale of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was `` imminent,'' the stock rose to $ 6.25 per share and trading volume increased sharply. The sale did n't take place. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection under bankruptcy laws on April 14, the day before <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> was taken over by the government. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> stock now trades for 5 cents a share. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> she had recommended that a press release about the sale be issued and that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> specified that the word ` imminent' had to be used. `` He said that he wanted, no matter what else I put in the press release, to make sure I used the word ` imminent,'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told the newspaper. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she has a draft of the release that has a notation written in the margin by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. There was no immediate comment Tuesday from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>; company officials did n't return phone calls. However, in documents prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials have said Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was responsible for the press release's contents and that the release was issued in response to news media inquiries. `` I did n't create the news, I only disseminated the news,'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I had no reason to believe the information he had given me was incorrect.'' Several individuals familiar with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to sell <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> told the Republic the statement about a sale being imminent was false. `` It was untrue in our judgment,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Leff </PERSON>, one of the investors interested in buying the thrift. `` I smiled when I saw <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> making his flamboyant statements.'' `` What bothered me was that they lied,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chief deputy commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan. `` They knew absolutely dead certain that the sale was not imminent.'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she has cooperated with government officials who contacted her. But she said there was no indication if she'll be called to testify in any proceedings Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> called her into his office in April and told her <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was dismantling its public relations unit, which consisted of herself and clerical staff. She said she did n't receive severance, vacation pay or even compensation for the day she was told she was dismissed. A single mother of three, Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she does some public-relations consulting work from her home but has had difficulty finding work because of her past with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheraton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> bristled with guns Tuesday. Salvadoran soldiers with assault rifles crouched in the lobby, sharpshooters perched on the roof. Armored personnel carriers occupied the parking lot _ instead of the usual luxury sedans _ and ambulances were parked ominously nearby. Helicopters and warplanes roared overhead. The stretch of swimming pool and lounge chairs between the main building and the VIP tower, which the guerrillas had taken, was no-man's land. At least four armed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers were trapped on the fourth floor of the tower. Reports later Tuesday indicated 12 U.S. Green Berets were believed among those holed up in the hotel, which is not now part of the U.S.-based hotel group. Guerrillas were on the floor above, along with guests, and on the floor below. A small band of reporters crouched in the entranceway to the tower, next to the stairwell that the Americans covered with their M-16 assault rifles. The American advisers said they were under orders not to shoot unless fired upon. It was a bizarre standoff. No one wanted to move. No one wanted anyone else to move. Neither the guerrillas nor the Americans wanted to start shooting. No one knew if or when the Salvadoran troops might try to take the tower. The reporters crawled over to the edge of the stairwell, calling down to the guerrillas. None wanted to be interviewed. The reporters then called down the hallway to the Americans. No sudden moves. It was simple for us: Let everyone know who you are, where you are, what you want. One of the Americans agreed to talk. Three reporters were allowed around the corner, into the hallway. `` We would like to leave,'' the soldier said matter-of-factly. He asked the reporters to let the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> know they were trapped in the hotel and asked too that the Salvadoran troops hold their fire. `` We're here because we do n't feel we can leave safely,'' he said. The guerrillas and the soldiers had surprised each other in the hallway shortly after the pre-dawn rebel attack on the hotel, he said. Both sides `` took up defensive positions.'' `` We were talking to them, trying to calm them down,'' he said. After several hours, the guerrillas moved off the fourth floor. The soldier said his group had not fired on the guerrillas. He cited the rules of engagement for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> _ `` Unless we're fired upon, we do n't fire.'' The reporters returned to the entranceway. Suddenly a young guerrilla appeared on the stairwell from above. He sat there, in the soldiers' line of fire, looking curiously down at the reporters, smiling. As the reporters left, he gave a little wave. The neighborhood around the Sheraton, one of the wealthiest in war-ravaged <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, was a battleground too. More than 200 soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> Cavalry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>'s Panther Battalion and the army's 1st Brigade occupied the streets. Private guards at many of the luxurious mansions surrounded by barbed wire-topped fences added yet another element of risk to those foolish enough to venture out. Few did. The streets were virtually deserted except for soldiers, police and a few journalists waving white flags and crying `` Prensa! Prensa! -LRB- Press! Press! -RRB-'' Shots echoed and bullets whistled along the streets throughout the day, from every direction. Turning a corner or crossing an intersection was something that required serious consideration. A plane armed with rockets and machine guns made several passes over the hotel and fired at least six rockets. They landed about 200 yards from the Sheraton in a ravine alongside the hotel. Dozens of poor people fled the community of shacks along the ravine. `` The rockets blew our roof off,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, as he hustled down the street with his sobbing wife and two little girls. `` We were on the floor all afternoon, under our beds.''

<HEAD>Israelis Riot Following Death of Girl Struck by Truck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dozens of enraged Israelis blocked a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> street with garbage cans and burning bushes Tuesday to protest the death of a Jewish girl struck by a garbage truck driven by an Arab. `` Death to the Arabs!'' shouted the rioters in the <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanavi </PERSON> district in northern <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Police said the 7-year-old girl was killed instantly when she was hit by the truck driven by a city employee. `` The driver was an Arab. ... Somebody saw him going wild on the road, and others say he pulled the girl and ran over her, shouting ` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON>' -LRB- God is Great -RRB-,'' a man from <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanavi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. He was not identified. City police chief <PERSON> Arye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> told reporters, `` The driver indeed was an Arab, but it had nothing to do with the accident. The driver was arrested and his interrogation raised no possibility at all that he did it for political reasons. `` He works for the municipality, he was driving here and hit the girl.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted police officials as saying the girl apparently ran into the road from behind a parked bus and the truck driver did not see her. Residents of <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanavi </PERSON>, a working-class district, have held street demonstrations in the past to protest Arab attacks on Israelis in the 23-month-old Palestinian uprising. They stoned Arab-owned vehicles, injuring some motoritsts, but the district has been quiet in recent months. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded at least six Palestinians, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. The army command confirmed two wounded and said the victims were in a `` suspicious looking car'' near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and ignored orders by soldiers to stop. The troops shouted warnings and fired in the air before shooting at the car, the army said. It did not identify the victims but said they were wanted by security forces and were taken to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hospital. Arab reporters identified the two as <PERSON> Ihsan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moani </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heid </PERSON>, 20. At least 615 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire during the uprising. The violence also has claimed 42 Israeli lives.

<HEAD>D.C. Appropriations Signed After Abortion Provisions Dropped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday signed a $ 3.4 billion budget bill for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stripped from the measure an abortion provision that had provoked two vetoes. The measure, for the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, includes the federal government's annual $ 435 million contribution to the district government. The rest of the funds are paid by local taxpayers but must be appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government can spend anything. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday night vetoed the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> appropriations bill for the second time because of abortion provisions that would not have restricted the use of the taxpayer-paid money, while limiting federal Medicaid funds to abortions to save the life of the mother. Until last year, the district had been funding abortion-on-demand for poor women with locally raised money. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> exercised similar vetoes on two other measures over abortion issues. One was a bill providing funds for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> which would have expanded use of Medicaid funds to cover abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sustained <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto, then sent him a new bill without the abortion liberalization provison which he signed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also vetoed a foreign aid bill that contained a provision giving money to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> population control program. The program, in turn, supported a Chinese program under which abortions were sometimes utilized. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> removed that provision from the measure and sent it back to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his expected signature.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 99 to 0 Tuesday for a resolution condemning continuing violence on all sides in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and vowing to reconsider <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid if the killers of six Jesuit priests are not brought to justice. `` Both the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- leftist guerrillas -RRB- and the Salvadoran government must take strong action to end the violence that both sides seem to have taken against the innocent population,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. The non-binding resolution came a day after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to attach any restrictions on this year's $ 85 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, heeding President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s argument that such a move would undercut the new government of rightist president <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. But Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., noted that `` votes like yesterday's can be misinterpreted,'' and added, `` This resolution makes clear that we deplore all violence in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, whether it comes from the extreme right or the communist left. The comments were indicative of a growing restiveness in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` The question is n't what we think of the rebels,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., whose Appropriations subcommittee writes foreign aid legislation `` The question is what we think of the ability of the existing policy to succeed. The very fact that the rebels have been able to do this after ten years of supporting the <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> government demonstrates to me that that government is not nearly as in control of the military situation as they have indicated.'' Added Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan.: `` The extremists on both sides are driving this country into the sea And in the meantime, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens are starting to get affected by it. The president needs to personally get involved to get a cease-fire in place.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution was similar to a resolution passed a day earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and stated `` unequivocally'' that if the government does not make a good-faith effort to apprehend and prosecute the murderers of six Jesuit priests and two apparent witnesses, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will carefully review and consider the question of aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' `` The military and those who may have been involved in some of these violent acts should understand that ... we're not necessarily going to be writing a blank check in perpetuity, and it's extremely important that President <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> understand this,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` may find it necessary to condition or curtail'' future Salvadoran aid, he said The resolution also asked that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Feb. 20 on the status of the investigation into those deaths. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Tuesday's guerrilla attack on a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> hotel reaffirmed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' decision not to slap limits on the military aid for <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government. But the resolution also gave those who voted against restrictions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid a day earlier a chance to vote for language deploring violence, in the face of heavy lobbying and public protests by church and other groups opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. It was approved unanimously with Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, not voting. As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote proceeded, police forcibly removed several protesters from the visitors' galleries who began shouting comments againt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. The entire gallery was cleared for the second time this week, something that has happened only twice before in this century. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, objected to the action, saying, `` It's giving in to a few malcontents to clear everybody out because there are a few disturbers. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said three demonstrators were arrested on charges of disrupting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and demonstrating within the Capitol. Each charge is punishable by a maximum fine of $ 500 and or six months in jail.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> lecturer's angry letter to a prominent <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist attacking him for his comments on the gang rape of a jogger in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has led to charges and countercharges of racism. The latest salvo was fired this month in the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, the student newspaper. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON> wrote a column defending his letter to Dr. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> and accusing the psychiatrist of trying to have him fired by the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school. <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON> sent the letter to <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> after hearing him interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' about six young men accused of raping and badly beating the woman jogging in Central Park on April 19. The woman was released from a rehabilitation center in <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION> only last Wednesday. <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON> said in an interview last week that he described the attackers as `` monkeys'' in his letter because he felt the attack was animal-like. <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON>, who is also a consultant to television's `` The Cosby Show,'' is black. <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON>, a novelist and lecturer in English who said he is a friend of the victim, is white. <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON>, viewing the term `` monkeys'' as a racist remark, passed the letter on to a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> columnist after failing to get what he felt was a proper response from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. He said he believed the letter warranted an apology. <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON> said the subsequent column in the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> transformed `` an angry letter into a racial one,'' and prompted him to respond that he was being treated in a racist manner. <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON> said his choice of the word `` monkey'' may have been injudicious, but he did not use the term as a racial slur. `` It was n't _ and is n't _ a racial term to me,'' he wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` It could have been pigs, dogs, scumfish. They had behaved literally worse than animals.'' <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON> said he wrote <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> because he was outraged by the psychiatrist's description of the young men as having been angry, which he viewed as a partial defense of the woman's attackers. The <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> lecturer said he told <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> that he could create a backlash in the white community by defending such people. `` My point was to tell him he was an irresponsible idiot,'' he said. <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> said that in the television interview he said that `` any kids who attack and brutalize a woman this way must have some terrible anger and rage inside them.'' `` It was not an attempt on my part to excuse these kids' behavior,'' he said in an interview last week `` That would be absurd.'' <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> said he did n't think <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON> `` could be that unsophisticated not to understand what the term ` monkey' meant. He picked a common term used in derision of blacks.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist wrote the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s English department, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodhead </PERSON>, to call his attention to the letter. <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> said he also sent copies of his letter to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Benno </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and the university's affirmative action officer. The letter was written on <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> stationery. <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> said he had thought it might be a forgery because of its tone, and that if it were not, the English department should question its author. The letter `` raised questions about professionalism and whether a person holding such views was appropriate to be a teacher of black students,'' <PERSON> Poussaint </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON>, who is in his second one-year appointment to the English department, was chastised by the chairman for using <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> stationery to write the personal letter but was not subjected to any other action. For a university to get into the position of firing someone for saying something others may find distasteful `` is to do the work of censorship,'' said <PERSON> Brodhead </PERSON>.

 Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that he never acted improperly on behalf of a collapsing savings bank whose top official gave him campaign money and use of an airplane. `` I have every confidence that you and the committee will determine that there has been no improper conduct on my part and that you will clear my name,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> wrote <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala. and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, R-N.H. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> is one of five senators who received campaign money from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who headed <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, when it collapsed, becoming the nation's largest thrift failure The ethics panel had written to the five, asking whether their intervention for <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his bank with federal regulators was prompted by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s campaign contributions. All have denied any wrongdoing. The Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has hired an outside counsel to gather information in the case. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said he always represents constituents _ <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> _ when they have `` a valid complaint'' and denied his help is ever based on their campaign contributions. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> admitted, however, that he inadvertently did not pay in a timely fashion for flights on <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s corporate plane _ although he eventually discovered he paid twice for some flights. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> received $ 112,000 from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, his family members and business associates from 1982-86, although the senator has contended that some of them might have contributed to his campaigns independently of <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and three other senators met with then-Chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, on April 2, 1987 to discuss the board's investigation of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. One week later, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> joined four senators in a meeting with the regulators who were conducting the examination. The senator said he attended the meetings after complaints from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, and after receiving favorable reports on the bank from the large accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>; and from <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, now chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> but a consultant for <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> when he wrote a letter on the bank's behalf. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> complained in March 1987 that the examination of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was taking too long, and that bank board examiners were being unreasonably critical of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s investments. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, which was working for <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, supported his contention. The <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> letter, written in 1985 but given to <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> two years later, endorsed <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s investment policies and its management. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, noting that the bank's parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was based in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said, `` I felt reasonable questions were being raised'' about whether the bank was receiving `` fair and equitable treatment by the bank board.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> told the ethics panel that after the San Francisco-based bank examiners informed the senators they had uncovered potentially serious legal and financial problems at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, he `` was totally satisfied'' that the examination was fair and never intervened again.

 The government announced on Tuesday the final results of the presidential election a week ago and confirmed a conservative businessman and Marxist labor leader will be in the Dec. 17 runoff. The announcement was just a formality. Earlier results had shown conservative <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> and former union leader <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> received the most votes in the Nov. 15 balloting. Both fell far short of winning a majority, forcing the runoff. Collor de Mello of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led the 21-candidate field with 20,609,009 votes, or 28.52 percent, after more than 82 million ballots were counted by the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, received 11,622,673 votes for 16.08 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Irineu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamanini </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed the annual bill authorizing operations of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> scrambled to pass a version acceptable to the president before adjourning for the year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> objected to a provision that officials said would tie the government's hands in conducting foreign policy. The provision, stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, would have imposed criminal penalties on any official convicted of using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to pressure foreign governments into carrying out polices contrary to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> immediately passed by voice vote a new, `` clean'' version of the bill with the offending provision stripped out, and sent it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the hope of winning approval before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned for the year. The measure authorizes the spending of up to $ 9.7 billion over the next two years, and includes a series of trade sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a protest against its brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last spring. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sanctions include suspension of risk insurance for companies doing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, suspension of trade assistance, a freeze on exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites, a halt to sales of controlled munitions and an end to sale of certain nuclear materials and components. The bill also provides authority for the administration to spend up to $ 16 million to begin <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-sponsored television broadcasts to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, modeled after <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, a government broadcasting effort which has operated for the past several years. Also included are $ 910 million over two years for refugee and migration assistance, $ 2 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and $ 600 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. The provision to which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> objected would `` severely hamper the conduct of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy and would impose an unfair and unreasonable burden on our diplomats and on the conduct of our diplomacy and intelligence activities,'' according to a White House letter to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> backed down from the language, the confrontation damaged relations with some <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> allies on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and left lingering anger at White House Counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` I frankly think it's left some scars that are very deep with people up here,'' Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said after talks aimed at finding a compromise broke down. Congressional proponents of the provision took some solace in the passage of a separate foreign aid bill which contained similar language, without the criminal penalties.

<HEAD>Premier Says Hungary's Foreign Debt Larger Than Thought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s true foreign debt is $ 20 billion, $ 3 billion more than previously reported. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> told stunned legislators that false figures on the debt had been published for years because the communist leadership feared an admission of the correct amount would endanger talks with foreign creditors. Last month <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adopted laws and constitutional amendments to prepare for a democratic transformation that includes the first free elections in more than 40 years and the establishment of a <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> without communist domination. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was disbanded, replaced by a Western-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that promised to surrender power if it loses elections scheduled for next June at latest. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said while Hungarians greeted those changes with jubilation other reforms needed to revitalize the economy probably will lead to lower living standards and more unemployment. `` The decisions that need to be made now will not be applauded by tens of thousands of people,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in a nationally televised session. `` Wanting democracy, the majority supported the dismantling of the party state, but the new changes will be more divisive.'' There have been calls for elections to be held before June so that opposition groups can elect represtentatives to the new legisalature, still controlled by deputies who had been from the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. One legislator, <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Banffy </PERSON>, said Monday Parliament should dissolve itself at its session next month. Elections would have to be called within three months after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was dissolved and <PERSON> Banffy </PERSON> proposed they be scheduled by March 11. His motion is to be discussed by the legislatore later this week. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said until the elections his government will work to `` put national interest ahead of everything else.'' He said that would include a new relationship with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance and the Soviet-led Eastern trading bloc <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION>. He did not elaborate but <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has increasingly been turning toward the West for trade and often has criticized <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> as ineffective. Hungarian leaders have pledged to remain in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact but advocate greater sovereignty within the alliance.

 Federal prosecutors in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> scandal unsealed an indictment Tuesday charging a former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> employee with taking more than $ 569,000 in bribes from officials of the now-defunct defense contractor. The indictment said the defendant, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Osgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, reviewed <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s performance on <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contracts while he was a civilian employee at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. Prosecutors allege <PERSON> Osgood </PERSON> received more than $ 569,000 in illegal payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials between 1980 and 1985 in exchange for favorable performance evaluations, confidential <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contract information and help with receiving advance payments. The company also allegedly provided <PERSON> Osgood </PERSON>, 66, of <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, with use of a leased <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and 1985. <PERSON> Osgood </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, refused to discuss the charges, saying his client had n't yet been informed about them. <PERSON> Osgood </PERSON> was charged in a 13-count indictment with racketeering, conspiracy, accepting bribes and illegal gratuities, conspiracy and tax evasion. He is scheduled for arraignment in federal court Nov. 30. The newest charges were approved by a federal grand jury in April but were kept secret until Tuesday, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Obermaier </PERSON>. Evidence at earlier trials showed <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, once a small <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop, grew into a multimillion-dollar military contractor through various bribe schemes. The company collapsed in December 1986 amid allegations of corruption. Among those convicted in previous <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> cases were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Bronx </LOCATION>, and his wife, former Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a close friend of ex-U.S. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The former chairman of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was indicted Tuesday on federal charges he schemed to bribe <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> officials to release airplanes confiscated for drug trafficking. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, an attorney who headed the party from 1976 to 1980, was accused of conspiracy to violate the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A former Dominican general, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pou </PERSON>, 54, and his aide, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guasch </PERSON>, 43, were arrested in the case Nov. 5, and are free on bond. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierman </PERSON>, said his client would turn himself in to a federal magistrate Wednesday. If convicted, each of the three men face maximum sentences of five years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine. The federal grand jury's indictment announced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> accuses the three of seeking to bribe Dominican officials to obtain the release of two planes by the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island country. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, 53, strongly denied the charges in a news conference shortly after the indictment was announced. `` I am shocked and disappointed that this charge has been made,'' he said in a statement. `` I have voluntarily taken lie detector tests ... and have totally passed those tests on all issues raised in this matter.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said she had no doubt the indictment was political, was perhaps an effort to win the judgeship left vacant by the impeachment of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. `` You have to be a blind man not to see what's happening here,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` It's obviously political. Mr. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> wants to make a name for himself.'' Before being appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state senator from the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. His wife, Republican <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Nov. 7. <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, said, `` Any accusation that a grand jury indictment is motivated by a political agenda is false, unwarranted and shows a lack of understanding of how our legal system works. `` Today's indictment was returned by a federal grand jury that considered the evidence. They took into consideration much information gathered by law enforcement agencies,'' she said. According to the indictment, the three men had to pay to falsify documents to hide the planes' drug connections and ease their release. The indictment said <PERSON> Pou </PERSON> was paid $ 8,000 to smooth the release of one of the aircraft. <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> held $ 12,000 in escrow, and $ 5,000 in cash to be paid later for that plane, the indictment said. The deal involving the second plane was never consummated, according to an affidavit by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurin </PERSON>, who was named in a federal arrest warrant when <PERSON> Pou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guasch </PERSON> were picked up, was not indicted Tuesday. He has reportedly been cooperating with authorities in the case. <PERSON> Gurin </PERSON> headed <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, which specialized in recovering planes for owners. According to <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>'s affidavit, the government investigated <PERSON> Gurin </PERSON> because of allegations he had bribed high-ranking military officials in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries to recover drug planes. The government used an informant to pose as an agent for the owner of a plane seized by the Dominican military. <PERSON> Gurin </PERSON> told the informant that <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> would channel the money to generals of the Dominican military through his escrow account, the affidavit said. Between February and October, the informant met with <PERSON> Gurin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pou </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guasch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> to iron out the bribery details, the affidavit said. Most of the meetings were tape-recorded or videotaped by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed into law a $ 14.6 billion foreign aid bill Tuesday night that includes the first cash in a promised three-year aid program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The measure included $ 533 million in new aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, aid which has become politically popular because of the wave of economic and political reform sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. About $ 293 million would be in cash, including support for new private enterprise and to stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s currency; the rest would come in trade and investment insurance. It also includes $ 85 million in unfettered military aid for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where a weeklong spate of intense warfare has prompted congressional calls for a re-examination of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. As usual, more than one-third of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid goes to the two parties to the Camp David peace accord, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is due to receive $ 1.8 billion in military aid and $ 1.2 billion in economic aid, while <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will get $ 1.3 billion in military aid and $ 815 million in economic assistance. Other aid in the bill is earmarked for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which would get $ 160 million as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of a new international assistance program; <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, with $ 500 million in military aid; <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, with $ 350 million in military aid; $ 230 million in economic aid for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>; $ 440 million in economic aid to be shared among the four Central American democracies as the administration sees fit; and $ 20 million for an economic development fund for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The administration agreed to accept one item it had argued vociferously against, a section written by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., that would bar the administration from using aid money to buy support from other countries for policies the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not legally carry out itself Agreement came after Obey rose on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor and announced the section was not intended to tie the hands of administration officials carrying out their normal diplomatic duties, but was only to bar explicit `` quid pro quo'' deals with other countries to carry out prohibited activities. A similar provision in the bill authorizing <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> activities prompted a veto by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Tuesday night. The bill survived a major battle over whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should reverse a five-year policy and renew contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund, which carries out family planning programs in third-world countries. Pressed by anti-abortion forces, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed an earlier version of the bill over a provision giving the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency $ 15 million, and the section was later stripped from the bill. Opponents noted the agency operates in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which they contended forces women to have abortions to enforce its one-child-per-family policy.

<TEXT>
 In their third straight day of protest, chanting, yelling demonstrators outraged over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> clashed Tuesday with police and about 130 were arrested. With helmeted <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police standing behind them, the protesters held hands and linked arms to form human barricades at entrances to the Federal Building. Some of the building's 6,000 workers and people headed for court, fought their way through the protestors to get into the 20-story building. At the ramp to the building's basement garage, federal and city police stormed through demonstrator lines to escort workers into the building.

 Icy wind blasted down trees and power lines from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and whipped more than a foot of snow into squalls that stopped drivers cold Tuesday in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Two forest fires sparked by downed power lines burned out of control in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The weather was blamed for seven deaths. A tree toppled by gusting winds struck and killed a principal as she was getting out of her car Tuesday at her elementary school in <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` She spent a lot of years getting to know these kids and their families. It's just hard to imagine her not being there,'' Superintendent <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said in tribute to <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulmer </PERSON>, 60. A security guard died in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, after a fence blown off by the wind severed his foot. A <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> woman died Monday when a warehouse fell on her home. Slick roads were blamed for four deaths in two separate highway accidents in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In one, two young men died when their pickup slammed into a tractor-trailer and in the other, a 9-year-old child and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> woman were killed when the woman lost control of her car and slammed into a van carrying six children. The wind and cold were backlashes of an intense storm that crossed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Monday night and headed into the Canadian maritime provinces. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> posted blizzard warnings for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and most of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where snow accumulations of 15 inches were expected in some areas. <ORGANIZATION> Bangor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> shut down in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> postal workers suspended deliveries. The weather service reported gusts of up to 56 mph in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and 45 mph in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> Gusts to 47 mph were reported in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. State police in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> said jackknifed and stalled tractor-trailers were blocking many roads Three sections of interstate were closed temporarily in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> areas. As many as 40,000 customers of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s largest utility lost electricity, as did thousands of others in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Winds up to 86 mph Monday night knocked out power to at least 271,500 homes across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, including 97,000 in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area, utility officials said. Crews were working to restore service to more than 78,420 customers Tuesday afternoon. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area, gusts knocked out power even as utilities dispatched hundreds of workers to fix more than 120,000 outages from a storm Monday night. That wind storm slung a parked jetliner into a fuel truck at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and badly damaged three jets at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> said the utility still had 28,750 customers without power Tuesday afternoon. `` Some of the problems are severe _ heavy tree limbs breaking off, and in some cases whole trees uprooted. We've had hurricane-force winds for the last 12 to 18 hours,'' said <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>. Utility workers also were restoring power Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Forked </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, 40 mph gusts reversed the flow of water to the <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Nuclear Station on Tuesday. Plant operators reduced power and reported an `` unusual event,'' the lowest emergency classification. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, gusts to 50 mph spread a fire across three residential blocks, leaving at least 35 families homeless, officials said. Sixty miles north, wind blew away part of the roof of <ORGANIZATION> Beekman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poughquag </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, just 20 miles from the school where seven children were killed last week in a tornado. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, high winds damaged 22 homes, a business and 14 cars in Seaside Park on the coast and blew two homes off their foundations. Downed power lines sparked more than 50 forest fires Monday night in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, two of which remained out of control Tuesday, state and federal officials said. The largest fire, 250 acres, was in <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seyden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 Police fanned out across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as voters in the world's most populous democracy began casting ballots Wednesday to decide the fate of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his beleaguered <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. More than 100,000 paramilitary troopers were deployed to reinforce local police to prevent violence that has claimed 39 lives since the election for a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was announced a month ago. Most of the victims were campaign workers who were stabbed, stoned, shot or hacked to death by supporters of rival parties. Late Tuesday, the health minister of western <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> state was fatally stabbed while getting into his car after addressing a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rally in <LOCATION> Hatmatiana </LOCATION>, a village 600 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The assailant escaped. The minister, <PERSON> Vallabhbhai </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>, died early Wednesday while undergoing surgery, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, in one of his last campaign speeches, told a middle-of-the-night rally at <LOCATION> Kanakapura </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> state that only his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could give the nation the stability it needs. At stake are 524 of the 543 seats in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, the decision-making lower house of Parliament. Voters in only 15 of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 24 states and five of its seven federally governed territorities cast their ballots Wednesday. The rest of the country goes to the polls Friday and Sunday. Results are not to be announced until late Sunday or Monday. Elections in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are spread over several days because of the country's size, which compounds communications difficulties and spreads security forces thin. Authorities in eastern <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> state were using trained pigeons to carry messages from remote villages to the state police. More than 6,000 candidates are running for seats in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>. Voting was postponed indefinitely in <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state because electoral rolls were incomplete and balloting was delayed in several constituencies because of the deaths of candidates. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of five opposition parties, made government corruption the heart of its campaign. The coalition leader, who is expected to be prime minister if it wins, is <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, formerly one of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s most trusted ministers. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> victory would loosen a dynastic family grip on Indian politics handed down from <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, through his mother, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON>. It could splinter the party that has governed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for all but 29 months since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. Nearly 500 million of the 880 million people are eligible to vote. Because the literacy rate is only 36 percent, a voter marks a candidate's symbol on the ballot. At least 3.7 million government officials will supervise 600,000 voting stations. The outcome will be determined in the Hindi-speaking heartland of northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> that stretches from <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> in the west across <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> in the east. Nearly half the <ORGANIZATION> Lok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sabha </ORGANIZATION> is elected from what is called the Hindi Belt. Most Indians see the election as a referendum on <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s record since he became prime minister after two Sikh bodyguards assassinated his mother on Oct. 31, 1984. Less than two months later, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won an unprecedented 415 seats in the lower house, which gave it a mandate to change tradition-bound <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and attack its ancient problems of poverty and illiteracy. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> liberalized the economy and opened the door to foreign investment, but failed to reform the notoriously inefficient bureaucracy or clean up politics and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, a 79-year-old bricklayer in <LOCATION> Agra </LOCATION>, said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> candidates are thieves, but I'll vote for them anyway because I'm afraid the opposition will be even more corrupt.'' Opposition leaders built their anti-corruption campaign around a $ 1.4 billion contract with the Swedish arms manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> for 400 army artillery pieces. They and several Indian newspapers say <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid up to $ 50 million in kickbacks. The prime minister denied any wrongdoing and no evidence has been presented that links him or his family to the deal. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials retaliated by accusing opposition leaders of corruption, nepotism and murder. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> has become the rallying cry against the corruption that plagues daily life in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where a bribe usually is needed to get a telephone, a job or even into school. Once, in 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was beaten. Factionalism destroyed that government after 29 months, however, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> won the 1980 elections.

 National drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> plans to designate five areas as major drug trafficking areas eligible for extra federal aid, an administration source said Tuesday night. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said four of the chosen areas are centered on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The fifth area consists of various parts of the southwestern border with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

Administration officials have talked of making $ 40 million available to those areas, but the source said it was not clear yet how the extra money would be divided or what it would be used for. The areas will be identified in the second draft of the national anti-drug strategy to be reviewed soon by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the Domestic Policy Council. That strategy is to be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> early next year when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> submits his proposed budget for the 1991 fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers withdrew from positions in front of an American military hospital Tuesday after two days of protests by Panamanian civilians and government officials. There was a brief scuffle between six soldiers and 30 Panamanian demonstrators when the soldiers tried to remove protesters who had walked between two armored personnel carriers. No injuries were reported and shortly after the shoving match <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian representatives negotiated a settlement. It provided for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to withdraw with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military police taking responsibility for the street between the <LOCATION> Gorgas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and a Panamanian Health Ministry building. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armored personnel carriers and coils of barbed wire around the hospital had blocked access to the Panamanian offices. Shouting `` Gringos go home!'' and `` Gringo animal, get out of the canal!'' more than 100 members of the pro-government `` Dignity Battalions'' had hoisted Panamanian flags outside the hospital. The battalions support Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> who controls the government. Mercedes <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers were stationed in front of the hospital after <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> refused to increase security following bomb threats. A spokesman for the protesters said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were posted at the hospital because the hospital was being used to treat people wounded in the civil war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The Southern Command denied Salvadorans were being flown in for treatment. The Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deployment was `` a powerful affront to our territorial sovereignty, a flagrant violation'' of the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties that give <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> control of the waterway at the end of 1999. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been pressing for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal since he was indicted in February 1988 by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the charges and accuses the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to renege on the canal treaties.

 The federal government, accusing <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of not telling employees what hazardous materials they were working with, on Tuesday proposed $ 377,240 in fines for the company. If the fines are levied, they would be the highest the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has ever imposed on a telecommunications company, the agency said. `` It's a very widespread case,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>, an official at <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> regional office. `` The company has the ... health and safety resources to get into compliance.'' The company will challenge the fines, said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. `` This company has always been interested in safety,'' <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> said. `` A willful violation is not something the company would do.'' <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it cited <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> for 16 serious violations, 62 willful violations and two other violations. The citations resulted from 26 surprise visits to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> workplaces around the state in July. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> claimed the company knowingly violated <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> standards by failing to maintain safety information for each hazardous chemical used at workplaces and failing to provide employees with information and training on proper handling of hazardous materials, according to <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>. The agency also accused the company of failing to properly test employees for possible exposure to lead and failing to properly store compressed gas cylinders. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it found employees at an office in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> were not trained to deal with organic solvents, compressed gases, leaded solder and CRC 5-56, a petroleum distillate in an aerosol can. `` We are not alleging employees were overexposed to these materials,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSiervi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> assistant regional administrator in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON>, regional health and safety director for the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said the union was concerned about what its members might have been exposed to.

<TEXT>
 At last they're singing August <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s theatrical blues in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. After years of being virtually unknown in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the Pulitzer Prize-winning American playwright is responsible for one of the hits of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> fall: `` <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>'s Black Bottom'' at the Royal National Theater. `` Ma Rainey'' ran eight months on Broadway in the 1984-5 season, was named best play by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION>' Circle and was a Tony nominee. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s next play, `` Fences,'' again won the Drama Critics' award, as well as the <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> and the Pulitzer Prize `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone,'' netted <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s third Drama Critics' award in four years In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is considered one of the great finds of the decade in playwriting. A former poet born in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to a black mother and a white father, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is writing a cycle of plays about the black experience this century, one play for each decade. Now, confounding those who doubted <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s pungently colloquial, blues-based language could travel overseas, `` Ma Rainey'' has won plaudits in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, vindicating the playwright's belief that his message and characters transcend borders `` I think it's a true test of the universality of the play, if you can move from the specifics of black American expression and say, OK, the plays are about that, but they are also about the human condition,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said in an interview at the National, where `` Ma Rainey'' opened Oct. 25 in the small Cottesloe auditorium. Intended to run until Jan. 27, the production has been extended through May. Set in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> recording studio in 1927, the play tells a rending story of racial exploitation and divisiveness involving <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, the `` mother of the blues''; the four black members of her band; and the two white men who are her producer and manager. The cast mixes local talent such as Oxford-educated <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarshie </PERSON> with such American expatriates as <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, who starred in `` Driving Miss Daisy'' on the West End. The director is Englishman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, whose last American play was <PERSON> Tennessee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' at the National in 1988. He also directed `` Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods-Coleman </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, initially doubted the actors and director would mesh in their approach to the play. `` I was wondering about that prior to meeting <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> -LRB- but -RRB- our first meeting put all those queries at ease,'' said <PERSON> Woods-Coleman </PERSON>. She praised <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> as `` sensitive and sensible and a very thorough director. `` He let us move with our experience of being black and knowing about black history without putting bridles on us,'' said the actress, who won <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> acclaim in 1987 for the musical `` Blues in the Night.'' She starred in an off-Broadway production of that show last fall. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has worked almost exclusively alongside black director <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, and feels `` Ma Rainey'' is `` best served by a black director.'' But `` any human should be interested in, and able to recognize, the humanity in it,'' he says. `` Because the play is about betrayal and honor and duty and love and all these other universal things, it should be able to be directed by anyone _ white, Asian, whoever.'' `` Ma Rainey'' is the second recent American play, following <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s `` Speed-the-Plow,'' which the National has staged commendably this year. Two other <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> plays debut in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in March: `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone'' at the `` fringe'' Tricycle Theater in northwest <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and `` Fences'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playhouse </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> repeating his Tony-winning direction <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s next Broadway play, `` The Piano Lesson,'' opens April 16 at the Walter Kerr Theater.

 When you're talking about the book, `` Blinds & amp; Shutters,'' subtitled `` the Photographic Collection of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>,'' further subtitled `` Text and Actual Signatures of his Friends, the World's Pop and Art Legends,'' you're talking big numbers. The 384-page book, of which 5,000 have been printed, weighs 11 pounds, has a pricetag of $ 595 and cost <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION>' bassist, $ 100,000. It's sold by mail, from <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a young British photographer, who hung out in the worlds of art, fashion and pop music, died in 1973. The book includes a suicide letter addressed to his 8-year-old son, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> now works as a clapper loader on movies. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was hanging around with a camera,'' <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> recalls. `` Nobody paid much attention. He took pictures without you realizing it. Those were the days you were n't afraid of the gutter press in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. You never thought of a photographer interfering in your privacy. Lucky <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. He did our ` Their Satanic Majesties Request' cover and the Beatles' ` Sgt. Pepper's <ORGANIZATION> Lonely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>.''' <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> was involved in the larger-than-expected project of compiling the book for six years. `` I was approached by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s son and his assistant,'' <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> recalled in an interview. `` They wanted to put together a really good book about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s life I put them in touch with various people. They came back a month later; they were n't having much joy.'' <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> said they had print and identify for about 70,000 negatives. Very few had been seen before. `` We had continual meetings. I put them in touch with people to do one and two-hour interviews with people who loved <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. They'd show <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapton </PERSON> a picture and ask him to say something about it and they did general interviews.'' <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> said he financed everything. `` I dread to think how much I spent. It was $ 100,000 at a minimum. I might recoup some. I thought it was a nice project to be involved in. It has been done very nicely. If I do n't recoup, I'll still be happy. It's something special.'' <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> says that some people buy expensive limited edition books hoping to sell them later at a profit. Since <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was a special friend of <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and not close to <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>, why did <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s son approach <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> for help? `` Keith is n't the kind of person that would do a thing like that,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. I'm more organized than <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, businesswise. I've got an office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. I've always been interested in other projects. I'm almost finished with my history of the Rolling Stones book.'' Many of the reminiscences culled from the interviews, included between pictures, talk about the drug scene. `` It is hard for me to talk about that because I was n't involved I had family. I was one of the two married Stones at that time. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> was the other. We did n't hang out with the fraternity very much at all,'' he said. `` The music business and people around that I was very into. I did n't know fashion people, artists, writers and poets so much. There were a few clubs that everybody used to go to. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, who did the wonderful painting of the Beatles with just the eyes, I became great friends with him and am to this day.'' Each book has 10 original signatures, some even contain <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> took pictures from the early'60s to the early'70s. Commenting on the'60s, <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> says, `` It was rather wonderful. I do n't think anybody was really aware of the enormity of change. We -LRB- the Rolling Stones -RRB- were responsible for certain changes in fashion and hair, being the long-haired ones at the beginning. We made it possible for places like restaurants, bars and clubs to let you in without ties and jackets. The casual approach was unheard of then. Through a lot of problems we had at the beginning, things changed. `` We were all ostracized for minor things. We could n't go into pubs and buy cigarettes. They would tell us, ` We do n't serve the likes of you.' We were refused food in restaurants. We were not conventional and they'd rather not deal with us, I suppose. It happened in every country. `` We were the only band that went on stage without uniforms. The Rolling Stones walked on casually. Now everybody has done it, ever since.'' Asked whether the 1989 Rolling Stones tour is exhausting, <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> says, `` The shows are n't. Going on stage has always been a joy; still is good fun. The energy is wonderful. Moving, traveling, unpacking, trying to get food and laundry done _ all those silly things are exhausting. `` We do have the odd day off. Everybody took a week off in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> except me. I was doing work for this book.'' Has he ever thought, since the tour started, `` I'm too old for this''? A smile creases <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>'s face. `` I wondered. But since the tour has been going, it's been OK.''

 When <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was a lad, his grandad took him to places of learning in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. These places had revues called `` Piccadilly Spangles'' or `` Toujours La Femme,'' and dance troupes like `` The Saucy Girls.'' A fine education. But what most interested him was the `` prin-com,'' the principal comedian. Little <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> saw that the prin-com got lots of laughter and hugs and kisses from all the dancing girls. `` I'd think, ` That's not a bad life,''' he recalls. `` And I think that's when I got hooked.'' Thus it has been for most of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s working life _ dancing girls in minimalist costumes, slighty naughty comedy, word-play, a bit of music hall. Much of it still is on display on about 100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> TV stations as the syndicated `` The <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> Show.'' Sight gags abound in his shows. A recent one here showed him as a ship's captain about to sing. As he opened his mouth, the ship's foghorn made what sounded like a basso whoopee cushion being sat on It bothers him not that some dare call this vulgar. `` You can do a show for six of your friends or you can do a show for as many people as possible. I'd rather make a hundred million people laugh.'' His half-hour shows, seen since 1979 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, actually are bits and pieces of the three to five one-hour specials he usually makes each year in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He reckons he's made about 70 in 20 years. He usually takes four days to rehearse each one, then five to film them. The skits are rapid-fire. Not so the writing of them. The longest part is the writing, he says: `` I write the show on trains, on buses, in hotel rooms on the beach at St. <PERSON> Tropez </PERSON>.'' His voice trails off and he smiles. This is far better than the early days, when he was a struggling young straight-man-turned-comic in music halls, pubs and the army camps where, during and shortly after World War II, he honed his entertainer's skills. The army pay was minimal, he notes, `` but it was a very good audience. You did n't have to sweat blood for them.'' The man the British tabloids call `` King Leer'' spoke of these things while on a recent visit to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to case the joint for a one-hour special. He'll tape it here _ at least sketches on the streets _ in April or May. Some comics, when off-stage, are said to be quiet, anguished souls who are on a first-name basis with the dreads. Not <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 64, a lifelong bachelor. Sitting in an office here with <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, for 20 years the producer-director of his shows, he remains an epic in extrovert, skittering from thought to thought, accent to accent. The tour of accents in understandable. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s cast of characters is many and varied, ranging from a Japanese warrior to a French waiter at the Hotel Sordide. But he has <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> time logged, too, as Bottom in a TV production of `` A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' He admires the fine British comic, <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>: `` An original.'' Also W.C. Fields, one of his heroes. And <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, whose gentle tales of family life might seem an odd choice, given <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s quick-hit style of humor. He first saw <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> in 1948, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` He was the first comic I'd seen who spoke the truth, or I thought it was the truth,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> says. Most British comics did quick jokes, a-funny-thing-happened-to-me-on-the-way-to gags, he says. `` But when <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> talks about his home, he seems to be telling the truth, and that's why it's more funny.'' During his visit here, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> briefly visited with a civilian, a fan named <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, as the world knows, is somewhat wealthy. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> also is in the chips, although to a lesser extent. Unlike <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, he lives quietly, without flash, and sometimes takes buses. This makes the British tabloids consider him eccentric. He in turn considers them eccentric. At one point in the interview, he mentions that a news photographer in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> spent 12 weeks perched in a tree to get a shot _ not involving him _ of a furtive affair-in-progress. But that is the way of the tabloids back home, he says, and why he is wary of journalists there. Eyes twinkling, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> quotes what he says is a British saying: `` The only reason that people believe truth is stranger than fiction is because they're not so used to reading it.''

 Financial need forced <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> back into the workplace four years ago, but temporary employment has since allowed her to spend the time she needs with her two teen-age boys. `` There's spurts of time when home is the priority,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> said. `` I totally lose touch with what's going on at home with my husband and kids if I work 40 hours a week.'' Mrs. Coats, 37, of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, is just one of many Americans flocking to temporary employment agencies. Some are parents seeking flexibility. Others are students seeking summer jobs, housewives or retirees looking to relieve boredom or people easing back into the workplace. Some make temporary work their career. `` The image people have of temporaries is, ` Oh, these are people who ca n't get a full-time job,''' said <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, information specialist at Manpower Temporary Services. `` But that is passe.'' <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in surburban <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, is the world's largest temporary agency, employing about 1 million people a year, Ms. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said Manpower has 1,450 offices and 300,000 customer companies in 33 countries. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> bought Manpower in 1987, but in a switch, Manpower President <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromstein </PERSON> became the chief executive of the smaller Blue Arrow. Flexibility and the chance to make extra money are primary reasons single and married parents choose temporary employment, she said. Temporaries can tell the agency if they prefer long-term or short-term assignments and can refuse a call to work, she said. `` Many temporaries are secondary wage earners and responsible for running the household and taking care of the children,'' she said. `` They do n't have the pressing need to work 40 hours a week.'' Ms. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said temporary workers' wages depend on the job, company and location. A file clerk with minimal skills could make $ 5 an hour, while people with specialized computer skills can earn more than $ 20 an hour, she said. Some workers who have a need for full-time employment still rely on temporary work either as a career or as a steppingstone to more permanent jobs. `` Temporary work has given me an overview of what's available in the employment arena,'' said <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON>, 41, a single parent who moved to <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last summer. `` It does meet my needs at this point.'' For many people, the biggest drawbacks of temporary work are the lack of employment security and health and pension benefits that regular employees get. But many temporary agencies now offer employee benefits such as insurance coverage and paid vacations after a certain length of service. `` It's great for me,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Skallinger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maplewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who has been a temporary for six years. `` I've got all the benefits plus the flexibility. `` It gives me a chance to be a good mother and give my all to my assignment when I have one,'' she said. College students make up a large part of the temporary work force for several reasons, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinsmore </PERSON>, public relations manager for <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` It gives a lot of students the chance to work during the summers but it's also a good way to get exposed to the job market for recent graduates,'' he said. Temporary agencies also provide a chance for companies to see workers in action before committing to hire them permanently. Manpower's workforce went from 330,000 in 1979 to 1 million this year, and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s rose from 330,000 to 550,000 during the same period, the companies reported. While more men are entering the temporary workforce, they make up only about 10 percent to 15 percent of their current employees. Most temporaries are office workers. One area of major growth has been older workers. Workers aged 55 and up make up 15 percent of Manpower's workforce. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> has an Encore program to recruit and retain senior employees. `` We get a lot of older, retired people who are bored,'' he said. `` They want to stay busy but they ca n't work full time or they might lose their social security.'' <PERSON> Dinsmore </PERSON> said he believes temporary workers have found a permanent spot with many companies. `` A lot of companies have temporary workers as a line item on their budgets,'' he said. `` It's becoming more and more popular to use temporaries for special projects instead of just to fill in for sick people or vacation time.''

 A variety of activists on environmental, energy and social issues are drafting a political program to create a national <PERSON> Green </PERSON> political party as early as next year, organizers say. Modeled after <PERSON> Green </PERSON> parties in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the party would seek to build nationwide policy on environmental and social issues that it says get inadequate attention from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic parties. But Green planners are divided on whether their new party should make an early run at national office, traditionally almost impossible for American third parties, or first concentrate its efforts on capturing local and state offices. The Green Committees of Correspondence, a federation of about 200 groups nationwide, mailed a 36-page list of proposed stands to 3,500 people this fall, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, coordinator for the group's national clearinghouse in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The Greens, as they call themselves, plan to ratify the final platform at a September 1990 meeting in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> Meanwhile, the 200 groups are planning regional meetings to debate stands on 19 issues, including land use, water, social justice, energy, health, education and finance. `` It's activists and just regular folks of all stripes who are concerned what direction this planet is headed in,'' <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> said of the 4-year-old group. Born from the remnants of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war protesters and the environmental and anti-nuclear movements that appeared in the 1960s, the largely white, well-educated Greens are far behind European parties with the same name, said writer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokar </PERSON>, an organizer. <PERSON> Tokar </PERSON>, a toxic chemical and energy consultant, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian Greens movements have been held back by the political systems in each country. Many European countries use a system of proportional representation in parliamentary elections, which allows even small parties to get into <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> if they win a minor percentage of the vote nationwide. Fringe parties have a harder time under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian systems, which elect representatives by district. European Greens, united by polluted rivers and forests dying from acid rain, won 30 seats this year in the 475-seat European <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has the largest <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> contingent _ 42 of the 519 federal parliamentarians. They also are in the legislatures of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` European Greens are basically defined by four pillars,'' said <PERSON> Tokar </PERSON>. Those are: ecology, social responsibility, community-oriented democracy and the non-violent movement _ where they are often seen demonstrating against nuclear missiles. `` Greens in this country strongly embrace those principles, but we've sought to elaborate on them,'' <PERSON> Tokar </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, home. The draft political program emphasizes: _ Creating environmental and economic policy that is not harmful to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the world _ Decentralization, bringing decision-making back from the federal and state level to local communities and the people whose lives it affects _ An end to oppression based on race, sex and economics _ Focusing on how the nation can work in harmony with the world community and nature `` The centerpiece is to rethink our relationship to the earth,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rensenbrink </PERSON>, professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Bowdoin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, another organizer. Issues such as the destruction of the Earth's protecting ozone layer are related to any number of government decisions in areas of energy, health, education and finance, he said. A handful of people guide the group, which opposes the concept of hierarchy. Decisions are made by committees of representatives, and a national leadership probably will not be chosen until the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> jump into politics, he said. As they continue to organize, <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> are forming clubs at universities and have state organizations in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rensenbrink </PERSON> said. However, the would-be political party is hindered by divisions on several issues. _ Green principles call for restraining capitalism where it harms the environment or community life But conservative <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION>, who joined to fight pollution, believe in a national economy driven by relatively free capitalism, <PERSON> Tokar </PERSON> said. _ Greens members debating the proposed national platform are leaning toward a pro-choice abortion stance _ but some members are anti-abortion, said <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rensenbrink </PERSON> _ Some Greens want a national party to organize on the state and local level, while others want to field a national candidate, Greens leaders said While the Greens are closest ideologically to liberal Democrats, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzano </PERSON> said her party is not worried. `` The bottom line is that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has a strong platform,'' she said, adding that it includes environmental and human rights issues. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> instructor in American politics, said the Greens may be able to push the issues they champion up on the agenda of the established parties. But he expects the winner-take-all election system coupled with difficulty raising money from their grassroots, activist constituency will keep the Greens all but invisible in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politics. Third parties usually are most successful in local elections. `` My overall assessment of their chances is very, very gloomy,'' <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Here's a diagnosis of <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' courtesy of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON>, a therapist for more than 40 years and clinical professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>: `` You have a very a successful physician -LRB- <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> -RRB-, who is starting an affair where he does n't know what he's getting himself into. He does n't show you at any time what the mistress -LRB- <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> -RRB- really meant. We really do n't understand what she once met to him, nor do we understand what the marriage means to him. `` Then you have the character of <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> that <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> represents, who is kind of idealistic but very unsuccessful. He falls in love with this woman -LRB- <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrow </PERSON> -RRB- and eventually she, too, disappoints him. `` You have to ask yourself not whether it makes sense in an isolated event, but whether it makes sense in the framework. I must say it does make sense. There is a kind of Chaplinesque idea there _ that life is very mysterious and you are a very small man.'' Very perceptive for a man who knows more about analytic couches than casting couches, but what business does a psychiatrist have rating films? In this case, plenty. Actors have played therapists, notably <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> in <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s 1945 thriller `` Spellbound,'' and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Clift </PERSON> starred as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>'s `` Freud.'' Now an analyst has turned actor. In a major breakthrough for the psychiatric field, <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> makes his film debut in `` Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' portraying the kindly Dr. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a philosopher of love and the subject of a documentary <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> is producing. Although an admirer of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s work, <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> was n't looking to be in the movies. His `` discovery'' came through an unexpected connection. A student, who knew <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s casting director, recommended <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> for the part. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> -RRB- took me to a room and asked me questions,'' <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> recalled. `` He wanted me to talk. He wanted me to talk about love, death and religion. I spoke about all of these topics for an hour and a half. He used a few excerpts in the movie.'' He only worked on the set for half a day and actually filmed a few scenes that were cut from the final release. One segment, in which <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> were to have a philosophical conversation while walking through Central Park, was cut because of cold weather. Another was scuttled because of a misconnection between the film world and academia. `` I was supposed to teach a class on the Holocaust,'' <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> said, `` but there I was, trying to ask questions and all the students were dummy actors, who were not supposed to answer questions. I am accustomed to an exchange and none of my questions were picked up.'' Psychiatry is his profession, but <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> really has read enough to qualify as a doctor of love as well. He's even written a book, `` The Anatomy of Love'' -LRB- $ 14.50, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, an academic's attempt to examine how the great thinkers of the ages have tried to make sense out of an emotion that seems without logic. `` Literature on love originated in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> 3,500 years ago, and the metaphors which the Egyptians used are still our metaphors now: love as a sickness, with the beloved as a physician. That love is a trap, they had already developed. Metaphors persist unchanged. `` Plato believed that we were once one person, that some of us were men and women, some of us were only women, and some of us were only men. We were cut in half and each half yearns for the other.'' <PERSON> Bergmann </PERSON> was born in 1913 in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, lived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1920s and'30s and began practicing psychiatry when he emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after World War II. He's a fan of movies, but warns against taking them too seriously. There are no <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gables </PERSON> in real life, no <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grants </PERSON> _ not even any Dr. <PERSON> Levys </PERSON>. `` We begin life kind of living in fantasy; we acquire reality only slowly and relinquish our world of fantasy only slowly. Long before movies were ever invented, the adjustment to reality was a very slow process because we have to accept limitations, and limitations are always painful. `` So we reserve a domain called fantasy in which we are still king and where our wishes can be met. Then come the movies, and it's on the screen. So it's no longer in the head, it has a quasi-reality. For many people it is full reality.''

 We've already had <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, the Chipmunks and the Raisins. Now, hopping and bopping to our shores from the north of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> comes a creature with _ it's a compliment in the music business _ ears. He's Jive Bunny. His first record is `` Swing the Mood,'' which sounds a lot like <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` In the Mood.'' The beat is what's happening now, in clubs whose dancers have parents too young to remember that <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and swing were once the world's dance music. `` Swing the Mood'' has hit No. 1 in nine countries _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. It's the fastest selling record in four years in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. As Jive Bunny comes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, his creator, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickles </PERSON>, comes with him, visiting <ORGANIZATION> Atco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, doing the talking for his rabbit frontman and handing out plastic carrot ballpoints to nose-twitching journalists. He says the reason `` Swing the Mood'' is such a big success is that the older generation likes the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> sound, people his age like the nostalgic rock that's mixed into it, teens like the dance beat and kids like the bunny. Pickles always wanted to be in show business and now, at 47, he is. His father, a <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> miner, became ill and could n't work, so young <PERSON> Pickles </PERSON> left school and got a job in an electrical shop before he was 15. He bought it at 25 and still has it _ `` retail and repair, domestic.'' He also has been a frequent master of ceremonies and after-dinner speaker. `` I've always been involved in a lot of things. I'm a nutter that way.'' Pickles, who drew up his own Jive Bunny contracts, sounds the opposite of a nut case or `` a simple boy from <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>,'' which he terms himself. He's proud that the artist who drew <PERSON> Jive </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> and the company that made 20 heads, for appearances by the finger-snapping, dancing rabbit, are Yorkshiremen. He's determined not to move from <LOCATION> Rotherham </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. And if his novelty lapin goes down the burrow as fast as he shot up, Pickles can cope. `` What's important to me is being happy and content. Money does n't make me tick. It's nice to have financial stability but it's not the be-all and end-all. I like to have a good time.'' Pickles' son and two daughters from his first marriage _ <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> was born to <PERSON> Pickles </PERSON> and his second wife Oct. 18 while `` Swing the Mood'' was No. 1 in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ used to like bedtime stories he made up. So he has written some Jive Bunny stories in rhyme. Publishers, TV and stuffed toy makers have shown an interested whisker. The tale of Jive Bunny began when Pickles bought and revamped, in 1983, a going-out-of-business recording studio where he used to record songs he composed. He named it Music Factory. `` I was reminded by my bank manager it was an expensive hobby. I decided to make it a money-making hobby.'' In 1986, after much negotiating for a license with the agency representing <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> record companies, he started <PERSON> Mastermixer </PERSON>, a service to disc jockeys in dance clubs, the second such business in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. It built to 1,500 DJs across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This year, <PERSON> Pickles </PERSON> decided to put dance mixes _ they're spliced from existing recordings _ on the general market. He looked through mixes on hand to see what might sell. Pickles came across one by <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemstock </PERSON>, an Englishman living in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, one of eight mixers working for him. Pickles flew him to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and paired him in the studio with his 20-year-old son, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>, to polish it for a six-minute, 12-inch dance record. `` It took them five days to create ` Swing the Mood' and took me four months to clear all the tracks. Nobody understood what I was talking about when I'd say, ` I want to license 20 seconds of your record,''' Pickles said in an interview. Even `` In the Mood,'' used as underpinning for `` Swing the Mood,'' gave Pickles trouble. It was recorded in <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> style by the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, which he could n't find. Eventually, he discovered it in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, operated by two men who had day jobs and owned their own, obscure record label. Pickles' mixers use machine-made drum loops. Vintage music had human drummers. `` You've got to keep varying the tempo -LRB- of the old music -RRB-,'' Pickles said. `` It can take six hours to get a 20-second link so it matches our back beat.'' He's horrified at the suggestion of using another human drummer. `` That would n't work! We've taken the good old tracks and given them a today's feel.'' Pickles cogitated, decided the record needed a frontman. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> snapped his fingers and proclaimed, `` Jive Bunny.'' The younger Pickles had labored in his father's electrical workshop where one man called everybody `` Bunny.'' They called him `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON>.'' Pickles phoned an artist friend: `` I want a rabbit. He is hip. He is today. He is cool.'' <PERSON> Jive </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> was born. `` We all know how much money can be lost in the record pressing business,'' Pickles said. `` I pressed up 2,000 records, gave 1,000 to disc jockeys, sold 1,000 in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to agents I've got out there and went on holiday for two weeks, in May. When I got back everybody in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was crazy for ` Swing the Mood.' I released it in July hoping it'd get into the Top 75.'' Its second week it was 31. Two weeks later it was No. 1, where it stayed five weeks. Followups were needed. The second single by <PERSON> Jive </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> and the Mastermixers is `` That's What I Like'' using `` The Twist.'' Chubby Checker has done some voiceovers for the company. The <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> was commissioned to record `` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Five-O'' music. `` Jive Bunny, the Album,'' to be released here in December, has eight mixes made from 70 recordings. Pickles will take `` Hopping Mad'' off the album, add some Christmas music, and release it in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as `` Let's Party.'' Bookmakers are betting it'll be a Christmas favorite, <PERSON> Pickles </PERSON> says, and the record is n't created yet. <PERSON> Jive </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON>, whose Father Christmas suit is on the drawing board, is n't worried.

<HEAD>Classics Always Come Home for Christmas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tinsel is on the tree, the egg nog is poured and the yule log aglow. All you need is something on the stereo to complete that holiday mood. There's always <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>'s time-honored croon of `` White Christmas.'' <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s voice remains forever strong on `` The Christmas Song.'' <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s `` Blue Christmas'' still tugs at hearts. If you're thinking they do n't make them like they used to, you're right. `` It's been a long time since something's come along that's become a classic,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitburn </PERSON>, whose Milwaukee-based <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> monitors what's hot and what's not in the music world Money pressures and the daunting prospect of competing with still-popular standards from decades, even centuries, ago mean that few artists even try to write new holiday standards today. `` If you're going to write a whole bunch of new Christmas carols, who cares?'' said Nebraska-based composer <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who records as a one-man band under the name <PERSON> Mannheim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steamroller </PERSON>, is responsible for one of the few holiday music success stories of the 1980s. He records instrumental `` New Age'' versions of Christmas classics specifically designed for compact disc players. With record companies re-releasing classics by <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, the Carpenters, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> every year, it may be a surprise to learn that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' 1984 release, `` Mannheim Steamroller Christmas,'' and his 1988 recording, `` A Fresh Aire Christmas,'' were the top two selling holiday albums last year. It was for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` I did n't really expect it to do anything because it was sort of a known thing that this sort of junk just croaks,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who was advised against recording holiday songs, of how Christmas music fares in the marketplace. `` Christmas albums were pretty much considered death in the industry,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` If you did a Christmas album, it was like signing off.'' The Mannheim Steamroller records wed the old and new in a combination perfect for listeners too old for rock' n' roll novelty records and too young for <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Welk </PERSON>. Orchestras, synthesizers and electric guitars are used in instrumental versions of classics and a few new compositions. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' records, along with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>'s `` December'' album on <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Records </LOCATION>, are expected to be hot sellers again this year. `` It has a broad appeal,'' said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>, associate research director for Billboard magazine. `` If you like traditional Christmas music, that's what it's about, but it's presented in a new way. People with gray hair can like it. And if you're a kid you can sit through it, and it does n't have to sound like <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.'' Holiday records have always been a strange stepchild of the music industry. Artists compete during a compressed time period to sell music to be heard in the background at a few parties then tossed into closets for 11 months. This kind of high-risk, low-return work makes many songwriters run in the other direction, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` Your ego gets stepped on,'' he said. `` They're probably some of the most difficult types of songs to write and have catch on because there's such an established litany of old material that people are fond of,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McLees </PERSON>, artists and repertoire coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Rhino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. The all-time champ of the modern era is <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s composition of `` White Christmas,'' heard first in the 1942 movie `` Holiday Inn. The song has sold in excess of 100 million copies, with <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>'s version accounting for about 30 million, <PERSON> Whitburn </PERSON> said. The Christmas song that's sold the most copies since 1955 is a little less reverent _ it's the novelty record `` The Chipmunk Song,'' first released in 1958, <PERSON> Whitburn </PERSON> said. Most of the Christmas records that are played repeatedly on the radio these days date from the 1955-65 decade. They include `` <ORGANIZATION> Jingle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Silver Bells,'' `` The Little Drummer Boy,'' `` Please Come Home for Christmas,'' `` The Christmas Song'' and `` Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.'' In fact, of the Top 10 best-selling Christmas songs for what Billboard magazine defines as the `` rock era'' -LRB- 1955 and after -RRB-, only one is from after 1970. That's the barked version of `` Jingle Bells'' by the Singing Dogs. The only new song of the 1980s to show any staying power is <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON>'s warped `` Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'' from 1983. The jury's still out on `` Do They Know It's Christmas,'' the Band Aid song that launched the rock' n' roll philanthropy trend of the 1980s. Mannheim Steamroller and other `` New Age'' records will face stiff competition this year from teen-age chartbusters New Kids on the Block. They've released a Christmas album with several new compositions by their behind-the-scenes guru, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, and yes, another version of `` White Christmas.'' It' already achieved the relatively rare feat of appearing on Billboard's top album _ not Christmas album _ chart in October. Other artists planning new Christmas records this year are <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>. Some record companies are hoping creative approaches to packaging will gain them a niche in the Christmas market. <ORGANIZATION> Motown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> is releasing a collection of songs from many of its artists, including <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and the Temptations. TVT Records is presenting a sampling of Christmas songs sung by soap opera stars. <ORGANIZATION> Rhino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, known for its aggressive repackaging, will present `` Bummed Out Christmas,'' a collection for Christmas cynics featuring such songs as `` Santa Came Home Drunk,'' `` Christmas in Prison'' and `` Somebody Stole My Santa Claus Suit.'' <PERSON> Rhino </PERSON>'s collectibles also feature `` Hillbilly Holiday,'' `` Cool Yule'' and albums by Dr. <PERSON> Demento </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and the Three Stooges. Rhino is not neglecting new material; it's releasing a collection of new recordings by Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicolette </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Roches </PERSON>. But <PERSON> McLees </PERSON> said there's not much of a market out there anymore for new Christmas songs. `` It has to be a great song to break through and come back every Christmas,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> school principal <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> became suspicious when two students who had been suspended for illicit drug use passed a drug test with little trouble. `` We found out a couple of weeks ago that there's a chemical that washes drugs out of the system,'' said <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON>, whose school _ <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> _ has received national acclaim for its drug-fighting efforts. `` The students use it full time: washing out their systems and being tested, all the time being high.'' The street name of the chemical is `` Golden Seal,'' said <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, explaining the `` herb'' also is popular with students in the nation's capital. This latest student scam is proof that the war on drugs in schools is serious and must be waged in a no-nonsense but flexible manner, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` Kids recognize all the problems of the system,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Spingarn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` They know how to circumvent us better than we know how to plan.'' The battle to keep the nation's youngsters away from drugs has evolved from a mere `` Just Say No'' slogan, devised by former First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, to a threat by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminitration to end federal aid to schools, colleges and universities that fail to document tough policies against illegal drug use. The tougher approach reflects the nation's growing concern with drug abuse. Statistics say that 5 percent of high school seniors drink daily and more than 60,000 adolescents ages 12 and 13 have tried cocaine. `` Young people show a faster propensity to develop an addiction and the damage by addiction can be more permanent,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The government is expected to spend some $ 500 million under the drug education program this fiscal year, about $ 180 million more than the year that ended Sept. 30. In 1986, only $ 3 million was budgeted for drug education. Almost all high schools and 87 percent of elementary schools offer some sort of anti-drug lessons. The new national drug strategy says school-based prevention programs should be reinforced by tough policies on use, possession and distribution of drugs. Schools are trying a variety of approaches with no clear trend emerging. Success is hard to determine since so many of the approaches are new. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, football players are tested. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> laws allow spot searches of students, and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> plans to use drug-sniffing dogs in the schools. <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, schools notify police of every campus drug incident, suspend students for six to 10 days for drug possession or use, and transfer repeat offenders. The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> has decided any student convicted of trafficking in or possessing drugs, on or off school property, will be subject to expulsion. `` Drug Free Zone'' signs surround public and private schools in Prince <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>' County, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, warning that anyone found possessing or distributing drugs within 1,000 feet of a school yard faces strict penalties, ranging from 5 to 40 years in prison. Education officials estimate as many as 25 states have some sort of drug-free zone programs or laws. `` We see more expulsions and suspensions for use because it's against the law,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Better </PERSON>, staff director of the Education Department's Drug-Free Schools Recognition Program `` But most schools have referral and re-entry programs.'' At the local level, Education Department officials estimate 73 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 16,490 school districts have written policies against substance abuse. Of these, more than 90 percent involve notification of parents and or police, suspension or counseling. Most major education groups avoid advocating specific drug policies for schools. At most they offer general guidelines, like those jointly developed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have problems when the feds try to impose decisions on the locals, so national groups avoid doing the same thing,'' said <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Armistead </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. Hall, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said: `` We do n't believe in dealing with these people as criminals. You really ca n't incarcerate your way out of a drug problem.'' Hall pointed to statistics that say `` school buildings or campuses are one of the least popular places'' for students to use or distribute drugs. Also, he said, students tend to use drugs more at night and on weekends. `` PRIDE supports treatment on demand,'' said Hall. `` But the problem is it's difficult to draw the line on whether the school is responsible or the parents.'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> insisted: `` It is a school problem because they ca n't learn when they are stoned They ca n't learn when they're dead. They ca n't learn when they're in the hospital. We're going to be paying for their rehabilitation forever and ever because so many people are hooked.'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said his drug-fighting efforts encompass more grassroots approaches of `` sending out letters of complaints to local liquor stores that sell alcohol to minors'' to encouraging temporary suspensions for drug use and automatic expulsion for drug sales. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s citywide policies, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> offers early-morning tutoring for students who want help with school work and `` to talk about what's going on with them, with somebody they want to trust.'' Jenlane Gee, a teacher from <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ recognized along with <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> as among the nation's best teachers and principals _ complained that the government's drug-fighting efforts have ignored elementary schools. Gee, who teaches third graders at <ORGANIZATION> Christine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sipherd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said just as much emphasis should be focused on the elementary schools because studies show that children usually decide by the third to fifth grade whether to experiment with drugs. <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> added that simply talking _ or acting _ tough wo n't stem student drug use. `` I think there's a hard line'' emerging in the schools, he said. `` But there's no comprehensive policy that helps kids to make good decisions about their future, their bodies and their values.''

<HEAD>Health Care Gaining Rank as Rural Development Goal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rural advocates for years have urged more attention for the medical needs of sparsely settled areas, the small towns and farms where a fourth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s people live. A recent study done for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says improved health care insurance would help as much as anything, ranking with jobs, water and sewer systems. The association, a lobbying force on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, is a major backer of comprehensive rural development legislation. Rural development is also the concern of a number of congressional leaders, including Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who says: `` We can not have two <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> _ one a land of opportunity and a second, rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, left behind. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said rural areas, with an estimated 61 million people and 14,000 small towns and cities, are in trouble because of higher unemployment and poverty rates than in metropolitan areas. The problems of rural health care seem obvious to the casual observer _ there are simply not enough doctors and hospitals in the countryside. A sick or injured person in the big city has a much better chance of getting quick treatment than a farmer in the middle of a pasture in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Yet, some believe there is a more promising side to this dark coin, and that there are solutions. `` Almost all rural hospitals are losing money as a result of dramatic declines in use, changes in government funding, and fewer local doctors,'' says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` But that does not mean that rural residents must forgo local medical care.'' Rural areas can have a strong base for local health care, given some creativity and persistence, the report said. There are alternatives to hospitalization, and sometimes to doctors themselves. `` Most patients no longer need a bed in a hospital,'' the report said. `` And modern emergency care techniques can stabilize patients for transport to a more distant hospital. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners can help ease the workload of the local physicians.'' The report, `` Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the Revolution in Health Care,'' was written by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, a former professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and now head of his own rural health consulting firm. Co-author <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weis </PERSON>, a registered nurse, is a strategic planner with the same firm, the <ORGANIZATION> Bauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hillrose </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` Rural areas today have too few physicians,'' the report said. `` Some areas have none. Unlike their city-based colleagues, many rural physicians are the only doctor in town, bearing all the burdens of being on call every evening and every weekend.'' Moreover, it said, disproportionally large numbers of government-insured or uninsured patients live in rural areas, and that means lower income for doctors. Faced with career burnout and lower pay, many head for the cities and more lucrative fields. Hospitals built 30 or 40 years ago have vacancies galore. `` Most small and rural hospitals today fill less than 30 percent of their beds; 80 percent occupancy levels were common just 10 years ago,'' the report said. `` However, rural communities should not assume that their hospitals' problems will all be solved if more doctors move into town or if hospital reimbursement rates are equalized.'' One of the basic alternatives has been the development of primary medical care without putting patients in a hospital bed. `` Up-to-date primary care practitioners can meet 80 percent to 90 percent of all health care needs without acute care hospital beds,'' the report said. `` Technological advances now enable primary care specialists to provide advanced diagnostic capabilities in their offices or clinics.'' Nurse practitioners and doctor assistants can perform many primary care functions with varying degrees of supervision by physicians. The report said emergency medical services, or EMS, provide the other key to the future of rural health. Because of recent scientific and technological advances, a modern EMS system `` can actually be better than a typical emergency room in a rural hospital,'' the report said. With a trained crew working with a fully equipped modern ambulance, most critically ill or injured patients can be stabilized at the scene. `` Thus, saving a small, rural hospital to preserve emergency care is not necessarily the best way to keep emergency care in rural areas,'' the report said. `` In many smaller towns, money spent toward emergency medical care is better spent on upgraded <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION> capabilities.'' But talk of closing hospitals can strike nerves, as Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., demonstrated recently during a Veterans Affairs Committee hearing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> policy makers are fundamentally oblivious to the needs of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he charged. `` They really do n't understand the sense of space and distance'' in rural areas, <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> said. The discussion at the time involved the possibility of closing rural VA hospitals in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, a move ruled out at the hearing by Veterans Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says expanded medical insurance coverage heads its list of ways to improve rural health care. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of the association, said, `` We want to make sure that the needs of rural Americans are considered in the current debate on medical insurance coverage and other health care problems.'' <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON>, who was secretary of agriculture in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said rural residents are less likely than city people to benefit from tax incentives and other programs aimed at making health care more available and affordable. But he added: `` Doctors and nurses will be the first to tell you that it's not just their numbers that are important for good rural health care. We've got to assure things like adequate water and sewer facilities, nutrition education and preventive health care.''

The good news for Thanksgiving is that <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> prices are lower this year because of increased supplies and more grocery specials. Ham costs about the same as it did last year, <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the proposed merger of the nation's two largest armored-car companies would reduce competition and should be reviewed carefully.

The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division said Monday it opposed a request by Brink's, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for an exemption from <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> regulatory review of its proposed acquisition of <LOCATION> Loomis </LOCATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Mayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nickless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Sluggish car and truck sales may force <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to increase budget cuts above a planned $ 1 billion by the end of 1990, and the company may be forced to close assembly plants, Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> says. `` I think the billion is a catalyst to say ` You've got to continue to find efficiencies every day of your life, guys, and it does n't stop after you get to $ 1 billion, you keep going,''' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said Monday. `` So I think it'd be safe to say the billion is for openers, and we've probably got another half a billion we're thinking about already,'' he said. Asked whether additional plant closings were likely, he said: `` Maybe. We do n't know how deep the recession is yet.'' Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it would stop production of its Omni and Horizon subcompacts at a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> assembly plant in February. The announcement drew heated criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, which planned a demonstration today outside <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> held a brief news conference Monday after a luncheon during which <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> presented the nation's No. 3 automaker with its Safety Leadership Award. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker to make driver's - side air bags a standard feature on all U.S.-made cars for the 1990 <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said closing the Jefferson Avenue plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> was necessary, and he denied it violated the letter or spirit of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contract with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. `` The cars are n't selling, and we could n't have the people come in and dust off the plant or go bowling inside the plant,'' he said. `` The contract language is pretty clear: If the people are n't buying the cars you're building, then people have to go home. An optimistic prediction for 1990 car and truck sales industry-wide would be 14.5 million, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said, `` but things are little grim at the moment.'' He said the auto industry was in a recession. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials have predicted total 1990 car and truck sales of about 15 million vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executives have withheld predictions until later this year. In his luncheon remarks, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to offer standard driver's - side air bags a gamble that the public would be willing to pay hundreds of dollars extra per car for `` I do n't know if the American public is totally sold on this idea,'' he said. `` I hope the jury's not out too long,'cause I'm liable to get crushed. Under federal law, all cars made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after last Sept. 1 must have either an air bag or automatic seatbelt on the driver's side. Meanwhile Monday, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it planned to more than double the number of air bag-equipped cars it produces, increasing to 1.3 million for the 1991 model year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said driver's - side air bags would be standard on 13 of the automaker's 1991 models, including the <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is including driver's - side air bags on about 500,000 of its The safety device is standard equipment on 13 models for the current year, including the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reatta </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> <PERSON> Allante </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON> <PERSON> Camaro </PERSON> and Geo Metro. Air bags were optional on some 1988 - and 1989-model <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars `` Following our announced plan to phase in air bags on our passenger cars, the 1992 model year will include passenger-side protection on some models,'' <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> added. `` Assuming normal market conditions, we could be in the 2.7 million range by 1994.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> each are producing 1 million 1990 cars with driver's - side

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Gather This Week for More Sparring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> faces a ticklish situation at this week's much-anticipated meeting. The dilemma involves devising a way to stop the cheating by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members who want a higher quota, boosting oil prices a bit and setting a production ceiling in line with consumer demand. Whatever the cartel ultimately decides, `` it's going to be a very difficult meeting,'' predicts <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON>, editor of Petrostrategies, an oil newsletter based in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Oil prices are holding steady even though some members are openly cheating on their production quotas. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is producing at the highest level since 1981. On Saturday, the 13 ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> are scheduled to meet to decide their strategy for next year. If the ministers raise <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output ceiling too high, `` they're running the risk of jeopardizing the whole party,'' warns <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gignoux </PERSON>, the international energy director for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s eight-member monitoring panel will begin laying the groundwork for the meeting, to be held in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Just a year ago, oil prices were in the doldrums. The average price of seven crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was $ 12.34 a barrel, well under the cartel's target of $ 18. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude, fell to $ 12.60. Since then, prices have risen sharply. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> basket was at $ 17.76 a barrel. It briefly topped the $ 18 mark last spring. Futures prices for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> have been about $ 20 a barrel. Middle Eastern varieties are several dollars a barrel below that. Early in the year, the oil-producing nations curbed their production to help drive up prices. But in recent months, they have turned their taps wider, without hurting prices, thanks to soaring demand in developing countries. `` This is not a bad deal,'' said <PERSON> Gignoux </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said, `` There's not the same pressure to come up with a novel compromise.'' <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON> estimated <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production climbed to 23.4 million barrels a day last month, with big surges by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. The output was well over the cartel's ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day for the last quarter of this year Not since the spring of 1981 has <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> produced so much, according to figures from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Its output amounted to 23.2 million barrels a day in the second quarter of that year. Analysts say the cartel's luck may not hold next year when demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil is expected to slip, due partly to seasonal factors and saturated storage tanks. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> predicted earlier this month that demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> crude in the first half of 1990 would be slightly under 21 million barrels a day. If so, the cartel would have to cut current output to keep prices steady. `` The problem is ... getting production down so it does n't oversupply the market,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> To do that will require hard bargaining. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> have been flagrantly violating their quotas, the individual supply targets set by the cartel for each member, to press their demands for a larger share of the output total. <PERSON> Terzian </PERSON> estimated the two countries each were producing more than 2 million barrels a day last month, about double their production caps. He said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest oil exporter, lifted about 5.6 million barrels a day in October, higher than its quota of 5 million barrels. Analysts believe the Saudis, as a negotiating tactic before this week's meetings, have decided to pump more to try to maintain their share of the cartel's increased production. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is assigned about a quarter of the total output. Saudi oil minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> has said he would not give up any of his country's share. At talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in late September the ministers seriously considered an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> proposal to meet the demands for bigger chunks of the production pie by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. The ministers were expected to renew those discussions this week. Under <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s plan, the cartel's production ceiling would rise to 21.5 million barrels a day to cover the requests of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for higher shares. <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> also would get more. Smaller shares would be parceled out to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also would lose a bit. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> would stay the same.

<HEAD>Duties to be Hiked on Japanese, Taiwanese Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that several small business telephone systems made in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> are being sold here at unfairly low prices, causing harm to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers. The decision Monday opened the way for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> starting next month to start collecting `` dumping'' duties of more than 100 percent from importers of one <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> maker and several Japanese makers. That is expected to result in higher prices for the systems in this country or fewer imports, or a combination of both. The six-member commission voted 3-3 on an anti-dumping petition filed by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> makers, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Comdial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The tie vote means acceptance of their claims. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier ruled that office phone systems with from two to 256 lines were being `` dumped'' in this country, will instruct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customs in the first part of December to start depositing higher duties, officials said. The decision in a similar case involving imported South Korean telephone equipment was postponed for 60 days at the request of the Korean manufacturers, they reported. The `` dumping margin'' on Japanese imports, to be reflected in higher duties, was fixed by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> at 179 percent for products of <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, 137 percent for those of <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and 158 percent for all others. The margin on Nitsukoi products from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was set for 130 percent, while the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found no `` dumping margin'' for other Taiwanese brands. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> small business telephone systems are made mostly in the states of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T welcomed the commission decision, declaring in a statement that `` we are confident that all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers can be very successful in this market once unlawful pricing ends.'' It added that the decision will enable <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to `` continue to be able to bring its innovative strength to this marketplace and bring new, even more innovative solitions to small business customer needs.''

 The music is still playing in the marathon contest for control of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and neither suitor is ready to give up. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which started the dance with an unsolicited buyout offer in early June, said Monday it was increasing its cash tender offer for a controlling interest in LIN by $ 625 million to $ 3.4 billion. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> also said that if its offer succeeded, it would have LIN borrow $ 425 million to buy <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> stock which then would be distributed to remaining LIN shareholders. `` Our amended offer, which has a value more than $ 800 million higher than our earlier offer, is clearly the superior alternative for LIN's shareholders,'' said <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>. The alternative is a competing offer from <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Atlanta-based regional telephone company that has agreed to merge its cellular telephone operations with LIN's cellular business. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> said its board would review the revised proposal `` on a timely basis,'' but urged its shareholders against tendering to <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> until its board announced its recommendation. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> said it was studying the revised offer but that its first reading indicated its own deal with <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> offered more `` strength and value'' to <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. Analysts said they valued <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s new offer at $ 123 to $ 128 a share, compared with $ 110 to $ 113 a share under <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s previous offer and $ 117 to $ 124 a share under the <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> offer. `` I am sure that <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> will come back with a higher offer,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, telecommunications analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> climbed $ 4.37 -LCB- a share to close at $ 120.12 -LCB-, while <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 1.25 to $ 35.75. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> rose 50 cents a share to $ 51.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, asked LIN to put its new offer to a vote at the previously scheduled Jan. 12 meeting, at which LIN's shareholders are being asked to consider <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> refuses, it intends to `` take our case directly to the LIN stockholders'' by mounting a proxy fight for control of the LIN board. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> is the nation's largest cellular company, but <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to merge its cellular operations with those of <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> would create a cellular company larger than McCaw. Under its latest offer, <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 150 a share for 22.5 million LIN shares, or $ 3.4 billion. Its previous offer was $ 125 per share for 22 million shares, a total of $ 2.75 billion. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> already owns about 5.1 million LIN shares, and the revised offer would give it 51.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s 53.9 million shares. In addition, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said that as soon as possible after the tender offer is completed <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> would have LIN buy $ 425 million of <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> stock and distribute it to <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, at a value of $ 16.17 in stock for each LIN share held. The new offer expires at midnight EST Dec. 15, although it would be extended until the LIN shareholder meeting if LIN puts the bid to a vote. Under the deal with <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would get a cash dividend of $ 42 a share, stock in the new cellular company that would be created by the merger of LIN and <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> cellular interests and stock in a new company that would consist of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s seven television stations The participants in both deals have offered guarantees that LIN shareholders who hold on to their stock in the cellular company will get private market value for it several years down the road. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing their merger plan in October that they felt the deal could be closed in the first quarter of 1990. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said regulatory approvals could delay the BellSouth-LIN deal for up to a year. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said its deal could be closed much sooner and said it would demonstrate its confidence in that by paying interest of 12 percent annually on its cash tender offer if the offer closes after March 31, 1990. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said last week it has received firm commitments totaling $ 3 billion from a 22-bank syndicate, which, with about $ 1.2 billion of its own cash and marketable securities, is enough to complete the tender offer.

<HEAD>Shearson Commission Reduction Could Herald More Wall Street Cutbacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A dramatic reduction in stockbroker commissions by Wall Street's second-largest firm heralds further retrenchment during an industrywide slowdown in brokerage activity by individual investors, analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced a rollback Monday of 1 to 2 percentage points for 1990 in the portion of the commission a broker gets for selling investment products. It was <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s first commission cut in 15 years `` That amounts to a lot of money when it gets all done,'' said an official at one large Wall Street firm who asked not to be identified. `` I'm surprised at that.'' Analysts said the reduction was the first direct commission cutback in the last year by a brokerage house. Business has lagged on Wall Street partly because of an exodus of individual investors since the October 1987 stock market crash, and firms have laid off thousands of employees in an effort to save money. Brokerages also have imposed a variety of customer fees that go directly to the brokerage but do not affect the size of brokers' commissions But firms such as <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest brokerage, and <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday they do not plan to reduce broker commissions Such fees result in `` a slightly higher take for the company than it does for the representative, but it's not as brutal as this,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanbury </PERSON>, a securities industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroeder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You're trying to raise the revenue to the firm because the overall business is not that robust,'' he said. <PERSON> Hanbury </PERSON> said he expected other Wall Street houses to cut commissions. `` Either the business gets better or you're going to see it, and I think you're going to see it,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, which is 61 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has been contemplating trimming the commission a broker gets, known as the payout rate, by 4 to 5 percentage points over the next four to five years, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. In 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> retail brokers brought in commissions averaging $ 228,000. <PERSON> Shearson </PERSON> returned 46.5 percent of the total to brokers and their supervisors in the form of direct payments, employee benefits and deferred payments. In 1986, when an average Shearson retail broker brought in $ 265,000 in commissions, the payout rate was 43 percent. Wall Street officials said most firms' payout rates were are about 37 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, stung by declining profits and a low stock price, announced earlier this month it was laying off up to 800 employees and restructuring its senior management. While not slashing commissions, virtually all Wall Street firms have imposed `` handling'' fees on customer accounts to help enhance revenue without boosting expenses. Earlier this month, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> imposed a $ 2.50 handling charge on all individual investors' stock and bond trades. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> boosted its service charge last year to $ 2.35 for each trade from $ 1.85. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> expects third-quarter industry pre-tax profits to be about half of the $ 1 billion in pre-tax profits in the second quarter. The second-quarter profit marked a sharp jump from $ 200 million in the previous quarter and was attributed to increased volume and declining interest rates. The bulk of the recovery came from the 10 largest investment banks, which recovered from $ 63 million in first-quarter losses. But retail commissions accounted for just 17 percent of revenue in the first half of the year, unchanged from 1988 but down 25 percent from 1987 and 35 percent from 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> cut is expected to hurt the firm in hiring new stockbrokers. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> was one of several Wall Street firms to reduce its in-house broker training programs after the 1987 crash in favor of recruiting from other firms. Officials said they expected some brokers to leave the company in protest. `` It's difficult to go to the troops in a tough market where they're breaking their backs and say we're cutting you,'' the Wall Street official said. `` The last people you want to go to is the producers.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Discuss Bills To Curb Corporate Takeovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation concerned with the problems caused by corporate takeovers has been introduced by at least four senators sponsoring separate bills. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s securities subcommittee heard testimony Monday about bills that seek to curb takeovers and leveraged buyouts while protecting shareholders' rights. The senators appearing before the subcommittee were <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala Many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are concerned that the wave of hostile takeovers, mergers and acquisitions and corporate raids for profit are hurting the economy and turning American management's attention away from long-term planning. The subcommittee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., said he and the ranking Republican, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, called the hearing `` to provide a record for consideration of these measures in the next session. Congressional leaders were trying to wrap up business this week so they could adjourn for the holidays until January. All four bills would limit or close the 10-day window stock purchasers have to declare their intentions after they buy 5 percent or more of a company's stock. Under the Williams Act, anyone acquiring 5 percent of a company's stock must disclose their holdings and whether they intend a takeover within 10 days in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> document known as a 13-D. Most of the bills would cut that 10-day period to curtail what <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> called `` creeping takeovers.'' `` Because the individual can continue purchasing shares during the 10-day period,'' he said, `` his or her ownership can greatly exceed 5 percent by the time the public actually is informed.'' His bill would require disclosure within 48 hours. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>'s would cut it to five days The five-day limit would kick in if the purchaser acquires more than 5 percent in <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>'s bill. And <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill would cut the limit to 4 percent and require diclosure within one day. The senators also want to curb the practice of paying `` greenmail.'' `` Too often a raider making a play for a company becomes rich when a corporation is forced to buy its own stock at a premium,'' said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>. `` It's blackmail, but we've made it more dignified and call it ` greenmail,''' he added. His bill would prohibit the payment of greenmail unless approved by a majority of those holding the outstanding voting securities of the issuer. He and other senators said small shareholders often do n't have enough say in whether greenmail should be paid. <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>'s bill would allow a company to recover any profit made by a person who sells the company its own stock if that person holds more than 3 percent of the company's stock and has held it for less than a year. Specter's bill combined elements of the two bills _ allowing a company to recover its greenmanil payments, unless the payments were approved by a vote of the majority of the aggregate outstanding voting securities of the issuer. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> said, `` We need to shift the debate and focus our legislation away from the old ` raiders' versus ` entrenched management' fight to the more fundamental problems of encouraging corporate management to manage for the long term and encouraging investors to take a longer-term view.'' His bill would treat 5 percent holders of a company's stock as ` insiders' and block their ability to make a profit on stock of the company bought or sold within a six-month period.

 One week swinging a machete in the scorching sugar cane fields hardened <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s hands and his resolve. `` If I knew it would be like this I would have stayed home,'' said the 25-year-old father who grows yams and peas on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>. `` To me it's not worth six months from home. It's like slavery.'' But Fray <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, who stays in another of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bunkhouses, has returned to cut cane since 1984. He boasts of the cash in his Jamaican bank account and the new clothes and household items he can afford. `` No one promised no easy work,'' he said. `` I got no complaints.'' Seasonal laborers from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> have been coming to south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cane fields since the 1940s. But a recent book critical of the program and congressional review of the nation's sugar policies have drawn attention to the cutters' lives. In `` Big Sugar?'' author <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> describes the sugar cane fields south of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> as a place of misery, where poorly paid cutters struggle in Spartan camps run by profit-minded companies. `` The most perilous work in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the harvest of sugar cane in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' he wrote. Sugar industry operators and officials dismiss the book as misleading and inaccurate. Walking through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sugar's <LOCATION> Pelican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> workers' camp near <LOCATION> Pahokee </LOCATION> on the southeast shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> shakes his head at the suggestions of enslavement. `` Every year we have people on the islands begging, crying for these jobs,'' said <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON>, senior liaison officer of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The camp, considered by workers to be better than most, is a collection of concrete-block buildings, each housing 22 cutters on bunk beds. A dining hall and store are near the main road, although the cutters can travel the 10 miles into <LOCATION> Pahokee </LOCATION> to shop or eat. Sweat-stained clothes are draped outside nearly every building. `` This is tough work, no doubt,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, vice president of personnel for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's oldest cane refiner. `` The nature of this work probably brings a little more discontent than others.'' At least twice during the past decade, cutters have challenged their conditions. In November 1986, police riot squads were called to take away more than 300 <ORGANIZATION> Okeelanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees who stopped work in a wage protest; workers were returned to the islands. A smaller incident occurred in 1982 with workers also being sent home. In pale dawn light on a recent day, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> and the rest of the Osceola Farms cutters rise in the barracks. Over their work clothes they strap on metal shin and hand guards. By bus they travel to the field, burned the day before to remove excess leaves from the stalks. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>'s machete slices easily through five or six stalks at a time. The tops are also hacked off. The harvest is piled on the chocolate-colored soil, sometimes alive with aggressive fire ants. By noon break, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> has made about $ 25 at the minimum rate of $ 5.30 an hour. A $ 51-a-week food charge is taken out of his pay. Clothing and other needs are his own responsibility. `` Yeah, it's hard _ very hard _ to save any money,'' said <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, 23. `` My friends had come before and I wanted to experience it. We have no good jobs in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. We got no choice but to cut cane and do such things.'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last month after picking apples in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where orchards bring foreign workers in under the same special immigration rule. This year, about 9,000 cane cutters _ mostly Jamaicans _ came to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> under the program, which pays for transportation to and from the islands. That's about 900 fewer than last year due to the expanded use of mechanical harvesters in the 413,000 acres of sugar cane fields. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is the nation's largest sugar cane producer. Growers, however, say full mechanization of the harvest is not in sight. The cutters can work in muck areas not accessible to the giant machines. In other sugar cane states _ <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ most harvesting is done by machine. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected early next year to scrutinize the cane-cutter program during hearings on the farm bill, which sets import quotas on foreign sugar. The bill is scheduled to expire next year. In the fields, however, the concerns are much more immediate: food, injuries and saving money. Jamaican <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> rested on a pile of cut cane after a six-hour work day. Sweat covered his arms and face. `` It's not a place you want to be, these fields. I liked doing the apples, but the cane is a tough thing,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 25, on his fifth harvest season. `` We must come or stay in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and look for a job. It's better than staying home.''

<HEAD>Creditors' Agreement Staves Off Liquidation Order in Hunt Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former billionaire brothers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> could emerge from bankruptcy before the end of December following a compromise reached by major creditors. As a federal bankruptcy judge poised to convert the Chapter 11 bankruptcies of one of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> to a Chapter 7 liquidation, spokesmen for two creditors, <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, announced Monday they agreed on settlement terms. Terms were not disclosed, however. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> emerged from hours of closed-door meetings to announce he would defer until Dec. 15 signing the order. If the agreement breaks down, <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> could proceed with liquidation. <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> notified all parties two weeks ago that without an agreement by Nov. 20 he would convert the case to a Chapter 7. Under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, a debtor is allowed to continue to operate with protection from creditors' claims while a debt repayment schedule is arranged. Under Chapter 7, assets are sold to repay creditors. According to bankruptcy court filings, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> lists $ 169 million in assets and Bunker lists assets of $ 250 million. `` We could n't be happier,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON>, head attorney for <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who had asked for a delay in <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>'s conversion order The compromise between <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>, a mining company owned by the Peruvian government, refocuses both cases toward a more orderly reorganization away from chapter liquidation feared by creditors. Major creditors said they would have received nothing under a fire-sale Chapter 7 liquidation, and most of the money from the two brothers' estates would have gone to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which claims 80 percent of <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s assets and 70 percent of <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s. Four of the largest creditors in the case _ Manufacturers Hanover, <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and the trustee for <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ said they and the debtors would file joint plans of reorganization today in <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>'s court. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> has been trying to collect a $ 132 million judgment against the brothers stemming from the 1979-80 silver market collapse. With attorneys' fees and interest, the judgment has swelled to more than $ 250 million. Other creditors _ led by <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>, which is owed $ 36 million _ argued that <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> already has recovered its silver losses from other third-party defendants and that the money would be better spent paying other creditors.

 Thrift regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, acknowledging mistakes in his handling of the nation's largest savings and loan failure, today vigorously defended his overall performance and declared, `` No political figure influenced my decisions.'' `` We have all learned some tough lessons from this case. We made some mistakes, and in retrospect, we would do some things differently,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said in testimony prepared for delivery under oath to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The panel, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was conducting the last of six scheduled hearings investigating the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, in an opening statement, chastized Wall for rejecting a 1987 recommendation from field examiners in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who wanted to seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` sounded an eight-alarm warning ... -LRB- but -RRB- for 23 months and two weeks -LRB- <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- failed to take definitive and effective action,'' he said. The committee also planned to hear from the thrift's owner, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, but it was unclear whether <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> would refuse to testify by asserting his constitutional protection against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, millionaire, is the target of a federal grand jury probe and of a $ 1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suit filed by regulators. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his attorneys were advising him to remain silent today. Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, who has been critical of Wall at times, drew a contrast between the regulator and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> has made a career of public service, while Mr. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has made a career of self-service,'' he said. Democrats on the committee have been focusing on Wall's performance, while Republicans also have used the sessions to bring out the role of five senators, four of them senior Democrats, who intervened on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s behalf after accepting $ 1.3 million in political contributions from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> They met with regulators on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s behalf in April 1987, three months before <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> took office as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, now called the Office of Thrift Supervision.

They were devoid of any political influence. I was not under the spell of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>.'' Wall has acknowledged receiving calls concerning <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> from three members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, D-Ky. But he said, `` Those calls were well within the limits of propriety.'' `` Their inquiries were for a status report or to urge action, but in no way were they attempts to tell me what action to take,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, in an emotional defense of himself, told the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he made the call at a request of former Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouselot </PERSON>, R-Calif., who was then seeking to arrange the sale of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> `` I have no relationship with Mr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>,'' he said, adding, `` I'm proud to call <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> my friend.'' The chief thrift regulator's defense comes after weeks of critical testimony and may be too late to secure his political future. In response to a call from <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> for Wall's resignation, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said a week ago he was `` not closing the door'' on the Wall's departure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added he would make changes if it is proven that regulators were not aggressive enough. Much of the testimony in the previous five all-day hearings has concentrated on why Wall rejected a 1987 recommendation from examiners in his regional office to seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and put a stop to unsound practices. Instead, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> transferred the jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to agency headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and ordered a second examination, delaying <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s seizure until April of this year. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> blames the regulator for the delay, which he says ballooned the expected $ 2 billion cost of the failure. Wall's prepared testimony rejected that, saying his decisions, at most, delayed action less than six months, adding, `` The preponderance of the losses at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> was embedded prior to the time I became chairman of the bank board.'' However, he admitted he should have insisted officials from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> case participate in the second examination of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, even though he still believes their first examination did not turn up enough information to legally justify seizing <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> examiners found smoke, but no fire,'' he said. Meanwhile, a class-action federal lawsuit was filed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> investors seeking to freeze more than $ 100 million in investor funds that they contend were illegally transported overseas. The lawsuit contends <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> misled 22,000 investors into buying nearly $ 200 million in nonrated high-risk securities. The suit contends <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his family converted the funds to their own use by investing them in banks and companies in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A court hearing was scheduled for Dec. 4.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly mixed in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the markets struggled to recover from Monday's weak close.

 The stock market was mixed at midday today. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.56 points at 2,634.60 at noon EST. The broader market was lower, however. Declining issues edged out advances by around 7-to-5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 729 issues down, 550 up and 543 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 69.97 million shares, up from 65.02 million traded by the same time on Monday. Analysts said an early advance ran out of steam when the market took a closer look at a government report today on inflation that was slightly worse than most analysts had been expecting. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent last month as higher gasoline and food costs gave the country its biggest inflation surge since May. The government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline costs, higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable prices. `` There were some disturbing elements in there,'' said <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The market appeared to be shaky after Monday's 20.62-point drop in the Dow average, caused by a selling wave that hit defense contractors especially hard. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks had edged down 0.05 to 187.98.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders worked today at smoothing rough edges in a $ 14.8 billion budget-cutting package and completing a separate measure eliminating some Medicare benefits. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., told reporters `` a few glitches have developed today'' in efforts to pass the deficit-reduction measure quickly But aides said the problem was not serious and would not prevent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from approving the measure quickly and adjourning for the year. `` I think it is just a question of getting everything down,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. `` There's a lot of complex drafting and talking taking place. It takes a while to get it done.'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders of both parties shook hands on the budget plan shortly after midnight. The package derives about $ 4.6 billion, nearly one-third of its savings, from across-the-board cuts in most federal programs. They predicted quick approval by the full chambers and the signature of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It will pass overwhelmingly, I think, in both bodies because it's a pretty good'' savings measure, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters. `` It is a very strong, effective deficit-reduction package,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told his colleagues. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had told him that `` the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will support this package. The agreement, forged after weeks of closed-door talks, puts to rest a budget year that has seen almost continual clashes between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Democrats. Despite a springtime budget agreement that both sides thought would smooth their work, ongoing battles _ largely involving the president's unsuccessful quest to shrink capital gains tax rates _ were the dominant theme. Nonetheless, optimism reigned in the Capitol that this year's session would end today By Monday evening, a telephone tape recording that normally provides scheduling information for Republicans was playing a song called `` One More Day'' from the musical `` Les Miserables.'' The budget-cutting compromise includes about $ 5.7 billion in new taxes, most of them on corporations. One change affecting many wage-earners would include deferred compensation _ such as the earnings some employees place into 401 -LRB- k -RRB- retirement plans _ in the formula that determines the amount of wages subject to Social Security taxes. That could require workers in the $ 50,000 range to pay Social Security tax on slightly more of their earnings beginning in 1990. That item, agreed to toward the end of the bipartisan negotiations, would raise $ 400 million this year. The bill also claims about $ 4.6 billion in savings by leaving the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law's cuts in most federal programs in effect through the first week in February. Those spending slashes took effect Oct. 1, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> failed to agree on reducing the federal shortfall, which congressional analysts project will surpass $ 140 billion this year. The bill's across-the-board cuts would result in reductions of about 1.8 percent in domestic programs and 1.6 percent in defense spending, according to Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Other savings would come from other selected spending cutbacks and from a series of accounting shifts. Negotiators agreed to add to the bill a provision dramatically revising the government's system of reimbursing doctors for services to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients. The change will hold down medical costs in the long run and help assure that high-quality medical services are available to rural areas and inner cities, according to two sponsors, Sens. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, The plan establishes a national fee schedule based on costs of providing services. Physicians now are reimbursed on the basis of historical fee patterns that often have little relationship to costs of providing care. Separately, lawmakers hoped to close another elusive deal on repealing all _ or part _ of the newly enacted <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> coverage of the costs of extremely long illnesses. The benefit was created just last year with popular support, with proponents trumpeting a bill that would prevent the sick elderly from being driven into poverty by doctor bills. But many seniors have rebelled because many of them will have to pay a surtax to pay for the program. That tax reaches $ 800 this year for the 40 percent of them with the most financial resources. The House has been insisting for weeks that the entire program be repealed, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wants to spare minor benefits, such as coverage for hospital costs. Lawmakers insist they will do something before they leave town, rather than face furious constituents. In other business Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returned the final three 1990 spending bills to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature, all of which he had vetoed at least in part for abortion provisions. These included a $ 14.6 billion foreign aid bill, a $ 156.7 billion measure for health and welfare programs, and one providing $ 500 million for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'s budget. Lawmakers, realizing they could not override another <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto, stripped the abortion language from each measure. Should <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leave town before Thanksgiving, it would be only the second time it had done so in a non-election year since 1965, the last time being 1983.

 Machinists on strike for 48 days against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> head back to work Wednesday after overwhelmingly approving a three-year contract that could become the standard for the aerospace industry. A company spokesman today said he hoped for a speedy return to full production at the world's No. 1 maker of passenger jets, but a union head predicted operations would be slowed for as long as a year because of lingering resentment. `` I think that it's going to take awhile for the company to get their production back up to speed as they'd like it,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. More than eight in 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers voted in favor of the contract Monday night, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The strike affected more than 57,000 workers in nine states. It came as the company had a record backlog of aircraft orders of more than a decade, in part because airlines are replacing their aging fleets. `` I talked to my supervisor yesterday and, actually, it's a big relief,'' said <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, who tests new equipment and writes operating manuals at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s suburban <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> plant. `` There's no bitterness. When you're on strike, you're on strike. But when you go back, you go in there and work hard,'' she said today. A settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> traditionally sets the pattern for other aerospace companies, especially <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as well as for other unions at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> divisions. `` The 1989 strike will be remembered as the strongest and best strike in our history,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told union members as they gathered to vote in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kingdome </LOCATION>. `` I knew you would n't back down.'' Union members also met in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, to approve the settlement and end the second-longest strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said company supervisors and managers would spend today planning for the workers' return, with Wednesday devoted mostly to regrouping. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> shuts down nearly all operations Thursday through Sunday for Thanksgiving. `` We're going to put everything we can into getting back on schedule,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` From day one we said that this is going to impact us, so the opportunity to get everybody back as soon as possible has been important from day one.'' Average wages will increase $ 1.14 an hour in the first year and $ 3.24 an hour over three years, not counting lump sum bonuses, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Current hourly wages range from $ 8.88 to $ 18.42. Before the vote, cheers and boos rang out as union leaders entered the <LOCATION> Kingdome </LOCATION>. But in contrast to an Oct. 3 meeting, during which members rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> offer and approved the strike, only a few members threw paper airplanes made from pages of the contract offer. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>, 62, who has worked for 20 years for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, said it was easy for him to vote for the new pact because he was close to retirement, but he expected even the most militant strikers to go along as well. `` I think everybody wants to go back to work because they have to make car payments, house payments, buy groceries ... and they're thinking about Christmas,'' he said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, 30, an inspector in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION> with 11 years at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, said the contract is `` just a little better. ... Too many people are hurting too much'' to vote no. Negotiators agreed on the proposal early Sunday after 14 hours of talks. The union represents about 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers, including 43,300 in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, and 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. A few hundred more work at scattered sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and other states. The contract contained annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, the same as in the Oct. 3 and Nov. 4 offers. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the contract substantially improved two earlier offers. The new pact includes: _ Lump sum bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year, 5 percent the second and 4 percent the third On Wednesday, most workers will receive a $ 500 advance on their bonus. _ A reduction in mandatory overtime to two consecutive weekends and 144 hours per quarter with double-time pay after 160 hours <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had record earnings in its most recent quarter and holds a backlog of more than 1,700 jets worth about $ 85 billion, with delivery dates stretching beyond the turn of the century. The strike virtually halted production at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, delaying deliveries to airlines at a time of growing passenger loads and rising concern over aging jets. Using supervisory and non-striking workers, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> delivered 23 planes during the strike, but all were virtually complete before the walkout. The last <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strike, in 1977, ended after 45 days. Its longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948.

 An investment group headed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said today it has acquired a 5.9 percent stake in the cosmetics company <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said the group had purchased a total of 2.5 million shares between Oct. 3 and last Friday for prices ranging between $ 27.35 and $ 36.80 a share. The filing said the shares were purchased `` for investment purposes,'' but it added the group may have discussions in the future with Avon management `` concerning the issuers's recent operating history as well as the issuer's general business outlook and prospects.'' The filing said the group also may `` engage in discussions with other persons, including other shareholders'' of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. Last week, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> sought to repel unwanted takeover advances from an alliance of powerful investors including oil heir <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive and the <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> real estate family of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A limited partnership called <ORGANIZATION> Chartwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, revealing its intentions after it became known Friday that the group had bought a stake in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, said it may propose a merger with Avon or one of its affiliates. In a summary of a document filed with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chartwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that it owns 6.9 percent of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>'s common stock and intends to purchase additional shares. Earlier this year <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> rejected outright takeover proposals from the rival direct sales company <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and from Minneapolis-based investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> also fended off takeover feelers from <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 2.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' offer was worth $ 2.85 billion. In addition to <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the other purchasers of Avon shares listed in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing were: <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberndorf </PERSON>, both of Mill Valley. <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; TexGenPar, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> limited partnership; The <PERSON> Bonderman </PERSON> Family Limited Partnership, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> securities limited partnership; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonderman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> securities limited partnership; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> share prices ended slightly higher Tuesday as stocks rebounded despite bearish signals from the futures market. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 2 points, or 0.09 percent, higher at 2,185.1 points, its session high. The index's low was 2,171.0 points. Volume came to 350.6 million shares, compared with 364.9 million shares on Monday. The rise was achieved despite downward signals from the FT-SE 100 futures contract, which closed at a 14-point discount to the underlying market. Normally, the futures contract shows a 3-to-5-point premium. The market started lower as the pound came under pressure on the foreign exchange market. But the stronger pound in the afternoon, combined with a healthy opening on Wall Street, helped the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market move into positive territory.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell Tuesday to eight-month lows against other major currencies in moderate European trading. Gold surged above $ 400 an ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for the first time in 10 months. Dealers said the West German mark rose against all currencies amid speculation by non-German investors that the opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders would boost economic growth in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and possibly force the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> to raise interest rates. But West German traders and economists said they doubted the West German central bank would act soon on interest rates. Dealers said the dollar suffered from recent declines in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, dropping to its lowest level since late February against the West German, French, Dutch and Italian currencies. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.24 Japanese yen to a closing 144.43 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell further to 143.95 yen. Other late dollar rates compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.8200 West German marks, down from 1.8360; 1.6200 Swiss francs, down from 1.6315; 6.2000 French francs, down from 6.2465; 2.0537 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0760; 1,341.00 Italian lire, down from 1,351.00; 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.5645 from $ 1.5595 late Monday. Bullion dealers said gold benefited from the dollar's fall and from the turmoil in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Gold jumped more than $ 6 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 402.75 a troy ounce, compared with $ 396.50 bid late Monday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the metal jumped to $ 399 bid from $ 396.65 bid late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.21 to close at a bid $ 398.61. Silver fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.71 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.74 bid late Monday.

<TEXT>
 Consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent last month as higher gasoline and food costs gave the country its biggest inflation spurt since May, the government said today. The October increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index, which translated into an annual inflation rate of 5.9 percent, followed four months in which the index recorded modest monthly gains of 0.2 percent or less. The price spurt was slightly worse than analysts had been expecting. The government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline costs, higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable prices. Through the first 10 months of this year, consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly from the 4.4 percent price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988. Many economists are predicting that the best news on inflation has passed and that coming months will show higher inflationary pressures. Still, few analysts are concerned that the price increases will worsen beyond annual rates of around 5 percent. Underlying inflationary pressures had been masked during the summer because of big declines in energy prices. With energy prices now rebounding somewhat, analysts predicted that inflationary pressures will be intensifying in coming months. `` Inflation pressures are persisting despite the slowdown in the economy,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had a long string of very moderate inflation reports but inflation was never as good as those numbers indicated.'' Wall Street took the latest inflation report in stride. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose by almost 6 points in early trading. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> shrugged off last month's surge in consumer prices by noting that, if the past six months were averaged, the CPI would show an annual increase of just 3.3 percent. `` This is lower than that for any six-month period since December 1986, and lower than the average inflation of 3.6 percent over the last seven years. So inflation holds relatively steady but at a low level,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. In a second report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Americans' average weekly earnings rose to $ 343.07 in October, 4 percent higher than a year ago, but not enough to keep up with inflation during this time period Leading the October advance in the Consumer Price Index was a 0.9 percent seasonally adjusted jump in gasoline costs, the biggest increase since a 3.9 percent surge in May. Gasoline prices have been on a roller coaster this year, soaring by 21.2 percent in the first five months of the year and then falling by 9.3 percent from June through September. The price that consumers actually paid at the pump was unchanged in October. However, gasoline prices normally fall in October, so the frozen prices translated into an increase after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made its adjustments to take seasonal factors into account. Food costs were up 0.4 percent in October, the biggest advance since a 0.6 percent rise in May. Fruit and vegetable prices jumped 1.2 percent, reflecting higher costs for apples and bananas. Dairy products posted a huge gain for the second straight month, rising 1.8 percent for the biggest advance since May 1980. New car prices were also up in October, rising by 0.6 percent after having fallen for five consecutive months. The jump reflected higher costs for the 1990 models and a big 1.3 percent rise in auto financing costs. Used-car prices, however, continued to decline, edging down 0.1 percent after a 0.7 percent drop in September. Other forms of energy also posted increases in October, with heating-oil prices jumping by 2.5 percent and natural gas and electricity costs rising by 0.3 percent. Consumer prices, after discounting food and energy, also rose by 0.5 percent. Many analysts consider this to be a better indication of the underlying inflation rate because it removes the effects of two of the most volatile categories. Clothing costs were up 1 percent in October, reflecting a second month of rising costs with the introduction of new fall and winter clothing lines. Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the Consumer Price Index stood at 125.6 in October, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $ 100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost $ 125.60 last month, up from $ 120.20 a year ago. While October spurt in prices was slightly higher than many economists had been expecting, they said it confrmed their view that inflationary pressures are on the rise. `` Inflation is creeping upwards,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We see the underlying rate of inflation going to around 5 percent a year.'' As the year began, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was fighting inflationary pressures by pushing interest rates higher in an effort to dampen economic demand. But since late May, the central bank has been gradually lowering rates in response to fears that the credit-tightening threatened to push the economy into a recession. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> predicted the central bank would cut interest rates one more time, probably in December. But he said by May of next year, the central bank will begin raising interest rates again and would continue tightening through the rest of the year. But <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, senior adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was making a mistake by moving so cautiously in cutting interest rates. He predicted inflation would stay in a moderate range with annual increases under 4.5 percent, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> with enough room to do more to lower interest rates. He said such moves were needed to keep the economy from stagnating. `` I do n't see any risk of a major speed-up in inflation,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said. `` We are not getting the wage-price spiral that people had expected.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier that wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in October, leaving wholesale prices rising at an annual rate of 5.2 percent through the first 10 months of the year.

 The stock market was lower in afternoon trading today, weighed down by new worries about inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.97 points at 2,626.07 at 2 pm EST, after being up slightly for most of the trading session. Declining issues edged out advances by around 9-to-5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 885 issues down, 504 up and 538 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 105.25 million shares. Analysts said an early advance ran out of steam when the market took a closer look at a government report today on inflation that was slightly worse than most analysts had been expecting.

The government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline costs, higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable prices. Much of today's selling focused on stocks of companies involved in takeover attempts, analysts said.

 Government lawyers said Tuesday that former <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> knew that two of his employees were bilking customers of thousands of dollars. But the statements contrasted with testimony by others, including <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> enjoyed an unblemished reputation in the futures industry. Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's commodity markets, said <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> was aware that two of his employees _ <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON> _ at <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> were cheating customers. <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON>, both now of <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, deny any wrongdoing, as does <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, Ill. The testimony came at a hearing before an administrative law judge on a complaint against three men brought by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. If found guilty, <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON> could be permanently barred from trading. `` What did he -LRB- <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> -RRB- do? Sent <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON> back to handle more orders,'' government attorney <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Jerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON>, acknowledged that traders `` may have injured customers,'' but said his client had no role and did not supervise <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON> or <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON>. `` The question is whether he failed to act in good faith,'' <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>'s conduct was appropriate.'' `` He is chairman of the board, he is not the chief executive officer. He has a right to rely'' on others to keep an eye on daily operations, the attorney said. The government maintains <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON> engaged in `` allocated trades'' that defrauded customers. The term refers to initiating futures contracts without the required customer account numbers, then keeping profitable trades for themselves while sticking customers with the losses. The government is not accusing <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> of committing the trades, but it claims he was told several times between June 1985 and May 1986 that <PERSON> Furlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenspon </PERSON> were making bad deals. Futures are contracts to buy or sell commodities ranging from orange juice to stocks at a specified price on a future date. The contracts are traded either to lock in commodity prices in advance, thereby reducing their financial risk, or to speculate on price changes. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> chairman from 1983-85, was one of several character witnesses called before Administrative Law Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Painter </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> had an undisputed reputation as a man of honesty and integrity,'' he said. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, said: `` I have no doubt about his integrity or his honesty. His general reputation is very good.'' Painter is to issue a ruling early next year after attorneys for both sides submit final written statements. <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>'s decision to testify and <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON>'s to defend <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> prompted former Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s board of governors. <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> officials should stay away from <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, not help bail him out. <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON> is the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s outside counsel.

 Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union members chanting `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> lies'' paraded outside <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Tuesday to protest the closing of a car assembly plant. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month announced it would halt production of <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> subcompact cars at its <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> plant in early February and lay off about 1,700 workers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> on Monday said further plant closings may occur because of weak sales. `` This gives <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> a black eye with his credibility,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, chief steward of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 1264 at a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. About 500 protesters marched behind a banner reading `` <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> lied again.'' Among other signs was one picturing <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> as a chicken smoking a cigar above a caption reading, `` Mr. No Show in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> has declined to attend the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting next week in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, the first time since 1986 he wo n't appear. Two <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> executives are scheduled to replace <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>. The rally also gave indications that national contract negotiations, which open next summer, could be acrimonious. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> expire on Sept. 14, 1990. `` This is not just a rally for the <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> closing,'' said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 7 at the Jefferson Avenue plant. Workers from <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s Acustar plant in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, joined Detroit-area workers at the march. `` It's a scary feeling,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was laid off a few weeks ago from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s transmission plant in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> and remains a member of Local 624. The company said the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> plant closing is permitted under its contract, which allows for shutdowns due to slow sales. Omni and Horizon sales have been slumping. But union officials have said the move violates local and national contracts and they are angry they were not notified about the action before it appeared in the media. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, head of the union's <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said relations between the union and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> are strained because of the plant closing and <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday that others could follow. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Region 1 Director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON> said the conflict could continue into contract negotiations. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>: `` I think that they are the ones trying to set the atmosphere by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> going out there and making all kinds of statements, -LRB- like -RRB- well, we might have to close other assembly plants and everything.''

 Possibly wide-ranging cuts in military spending could hurt some programs of the nation's two largest defense contractors, but <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> indicated Tuesday they did not feel immediately threatened. Diversification into areas such as the booming commercial aircraft market, plus expectations of a continuing need for some major weapons systems, could soften the impact on both the companies and local economies of any cuts. Defense company stocks fell broadly Monday on word that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was considering suggestions for $ 180 billion in spending cuts over the next several years, due to budget concerns and reduced tensions in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Possible proposals include cutting the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by 100,000 soldiers, getting rid of 100 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and closing at least a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, down $ 4.87 -LCB- a share on Monday, fell another $ 1 to $ 43.12 -LCB- on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, down $ 1.12 -LCB- Monday, fell another 62 -LCB- cents to $ 67.62 -LCB- a share. At <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area's biggest employer, the cutbacks could hurt the F-15 Eagle and the FA-18 Hornet fighter jet programs. The company also makes the AV8B-Harrier, the Harpoon missile and the Tomahawk cruise missile. But without specific cuts outlined, it was too early to speculate on the impact on <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. General Dynamics is the nation's second-largest defense contractor. While <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has a commercial aircraft program, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> is defense-oriented and could be more vulnerable to cuts. But General Dynamics spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said the company did n't feel threatened because it had concentrated on making basic military equipment. `` This has been something that we've anticipated, so we've put our bets down on the programs that we think we can do best,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. `` The bottom line is we think our strategy has given us a very strong foothold for the 90s.'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said the company's F-16 fighter jets, M-1 tanks and Trident and Seawolf submarines were `` the programs that we think are going to be around.'' `` Sure, there will be some cutbacks, but we do n't see that any of our programs are going to be on the cancellation list. There's always going to be a defense requirement in this country _ that's never going to go away,'' he Any impact on the contractors could be repeated in a number of other regions with big defense industries, although several experts said <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> would feel little economic strain if eventual cuts were along the lines of those mentioned by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` Sure, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> is the largest single employer, but manufacturing has become a slow second to service areas in general in the metropolitan area,'' said <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON>, of the Center for the <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON> also said the defense industry was accustomed to cycles, although some past attempts at diversification _ such as <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s one-time production of powered wheelbarrows _ have not done well. `` I do n't know what they're going to do, but it is n't easy to turn a large aerospace company around quickly, because they're geared to producing items that are so different from a civilian item. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> recently acknowledged that the defense industry was likely to have difficult adjustments in the coming years. `` But I believe our industry is uniquely capable of shifting from military to civil production if called upon to do so,'' he said in a recent speech. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemann </PERSON>, an analyst from <ORGANIZATION> Stifel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicolaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> already was relying more heavily on its commercial aircraft business `` They're smart people out there. They knew the defense cuts were coming,'' <PERSON> Niemann </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' commercial aircraft operation, <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is booming and accounts for about 30 percent of the company's overall business, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

<HEAD>Gold Tops $400, Hits 10-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gold prices topped $ 400 an ounce Tuesday for the first time in nearly 10 months in a steady rise that quieted doubts about the market's underlying strength. Other precious metals also rose. On other commodity markets, energy futures retreated; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; and grains and soybeans were mixed. Gold futures settled $ 5.10 to $ 6 higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in December at $ 404.40 a troy ounce. The less heavily traded contract for November delivery finished at $ 403.70. Gold futures last closed above $ 400 on Jan. 26. Silver settled 14.2 cents to 14.6 cents higher with November at $ 5.834 a troy ounce. Analysts said they were impressed that the gold market neither balked at the $ 400 level nor surged wildly after crossing it but continued to exhibit the same quiet strength that has characterized the market's resurgence during the past five weeks. `` It's been coming up gradually,'' said analyst <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziemian </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` You have n't seen jumps of $ 20 at a pop, and those kinds of big pops are things that tend to set the market back fairly quickly, too,'' she said, referring to the selloffs that typically follow sudden, sharp gains. Indeed, few recent buyers have taken profits in the 5 -LCB- weeks since the gold market began rising from the $ 365-an-ounce area at which it had traded for much of 1989. `` The holders of the metal believe its going to go higher and that is the sign of a true bull market,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay-Coghill </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> GoldCorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION>, a state-owned corporation established to market Australian precious metals. <PERSON> Mackay-Coghill </PERSON>, who is touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to promote his company's gold and platinum investment coins, said he was `` delighted'' with <ORGANIZATION> GoldCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s sales volume. Investors seeking safety from the volatile stock market continue to lead the gold rally, analysts said. Tuesday's government report that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month may have spurred the rise of the inflation-sensitive gold market, they said. The report added one more note of uncertainty to an already clouded economic outlook. `` I do n't think people are looking to gold to make big gains,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ziemian </PERSON>. `` I think people are looking to gold as a safe haven.'' Energy futures prices ended lower in fairly thin trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 24 cents lower with January at $ 19.96 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent to .37 cent lower with December at 59.94 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .26 cent lower to .15 cent higher with December at 51.96 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures rose moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, buoyed by expectations for higher cash livestock prices Wednesday as packers gather inventory before Thanksgiving interrupts the normal slaughter schedule. Live cattle settled .40 cent to .50 cent higher with December at 75.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .53 cent higher with November at 83.22 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .50 cent higher with December at 49.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to .35 cent higher with February at 63.05 cents a pound. Wheat futures slipped on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while corn and soybean futures ended mostly higher. The wheat market opened lower and remained weak throughout the session amid selling linked to a lack of significant new export demand. The corn market was buoyed by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s report late Monday of an unexpectedly large amount of corn inspected for export last week. Wheat futures settled -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 4.09 \ a bushel; corn futures were -LCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.38 a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.45 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher with January at $ 5.85 -RCB- a bushel

 The stock market was mixed Tuesday, weighed down by the latest bout of inflation worries. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.25 points to 2,639.29. The broader market was lower, however. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 860 down, 622 up and 522 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 147.90 million shares, up from 128.17 million in Monday's session. `` People are pulling their horns in a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's a little apprehension, a little uncertainty.'' Analysts said an early advance ran out of steam when the market took a closer look at a government report on inflation that was slightly worse than most experts had been expecting. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent last month as higher gasoline and food costs gave the country its biggest inflation surge since May. `` That obviously did n't help'' stock prices, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline costs, higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable prices. Much of Tuesday's selling focused on stocks of companies involved in takeover attempts, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>, for example, dropped 6 -LRB- to 46 \ The chemical manufacturer announced that it has decided against a merger with <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the company controlled by billionaire <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> that had made a $ 1.1 billion takeover offer. Later, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> said it received notice from <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> that he intends to acquire 15 percent or more of its common stock. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> jumped 1 -LRB- to 37. The market appeared to be shaky after Monday's 20.62-point drop in the Dow average, caused by a selling wave that hit defense contractors especially hard. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> called on Sunday for a $ 180 billion reduction in military spending over the next six years.

 Gold prices soared past $ 400 an ounce Tuesday, crossing that psychologically important barrier for the first time since late January. Meanwhile, the dollar fell sharply amid speculation that interest rates might rise in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Gold prices have been inching upward in recent weeks, but when they crossed the $ 400 a troy ounce level Tuesday, buyers enthusiastically began to snap up the metal. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a troy ounce of gold surged $ 5.50 to $ 403.70, while <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid of $ 403.50 for a troy ounce, also up $ 5.50 from late Monday. `` Gold and silver all of a sudden are back in favor,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, a precious metals analyst with Republic. Silver picked up 14.6 cents to close at $ 5.834 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, although it fell earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.71 a troy ounce from late Monday's $ 5.74. In earlier overseas trading, dealers said gold benefited from the dollar's fall and from the turmoil in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Gold jumped more than $ 6 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 402.75 a troy ounce, compared with $ 396.50 bid late Monday, and in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the metal rose to a bid of $ 399 from late Monday's $ 396.65. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.21 to close at a bid $ 398.61 a troy ounce. The dollar slumped as speculation grew that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank, the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, would be forced to raise interest rates because the influx of East Germans into the country might boost economic growth When foreign interest rates rise and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates do not keep pace, the dollar becomes less attractive to overseas investors. Speculation that interest rates might go up abroad often sparks selling of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Overseas, the dollar reached its lowest level since late February against the West German, French, Dutch and Italian currencies. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, its tone was stronger because the domestic market was reluctant to turn bearish on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. However, the dollar still suffered sharp losses on domestic markets. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.81375 West German marks, down from 1.8338; 1.6130 Swiss francs, down from 1.62975; 6.1775 French francs, down from 6.2435; 1,336.00 Italian lire, down from 1,350.00; and 1.16995 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17105 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's quotes, included: 1.8200 West German marks, down from 1.8360; 1.6200 Swiss francs, down from 1.6315; 6.2000 French francs, down from 6.2465; 2.0537 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0760; 1,341.00 Italian lire, down from 1,351.00; 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712 The dollar also fell against the British pound. One pound cost $ 1.56975 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with $ 1.5582 late Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> earlier, the pound rose to $ 1.5645 from $ 1.5595 late Monday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.24 Japanese yen to a closing 144.43 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell further to 143.95 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it declined to 143.555 yen, down from 144.355 late Monday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> managers huddled Tuesday on how to resume full operations, while <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> members picked up a final strike paycheck and prepared to resume work Wednesday following the end of their 48-day strike. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> _ which already had an order backlog of 1,700 jetliners before the strike _ said the company may not be able to resume full production until after the first of the year. Workers seemed mixed in their opinion of the three-year contract ratified with 81.4 percent approval late Monday night, but most said they were relieved to see an end to the second-longest strike in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s history. `` I think it's fair, but for the amount of days we were out we could have done better,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, a jig builder at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm glad to get back to work but I voted against the contract,'' said machinist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncalf </PERSON>. He said the union had struck to get higher wage increases, but failed to get improvements in that area over a contract rejected Oct. 3, the day before machinists walked out. The offer ratified late Monday provides wage increases totaling 10 percent over three years, plus annual bonuses totaling 10 percent of gross pay over the first year, 5 percent the second and 4 percent the third. On Wednesday, most workers will receive a $ 500 advance on their bonus. A cost-of-living adjustment formula will account for virtually all of inflation. Workers will receive a 60-cent-per-hour cost-of-living increase immediately and a 45 cents an hour base pay increase to ake up for a 1986 adjustment that workers did n't get. The contract also reduces mandatory overtime to two consecutive weekends and 144 hours per quarter with double-time pay after 160 hours. In the old contract, workers could be required to work 200 hours a quarter and four weekends in a row, a key consideration in attempting to deal with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s order backlog. `` I think it stinks,'' said <PERSON> Ronda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a nine-year <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> worker. `` It's hardly any better than the contract first offered.'' But she said that with the holidays approaching, people wanted to be back at work. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had record profits in its most recent quarter and has a backlog of more than 1,700 planes worth about $ 85 billion, with deliveries for those jets stretching past the year 2000. The Machinists had received bonuses but no wage increases in the past six years. Production was severely curtailed during the strike, athough supervisors and non-striking personnel delivered 24 planes, many of which had been virtually completed before the walkout began. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said managers and supervisors spent Tuesday planning ways to smooth the strikers' return. On Wednesday, most of the day will be spent in crew meetings and other discussions of what work needs to be done on different projects, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. The work also has to be secured before the start of the four-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Gamble said there are only four weeks after Thanksgiving before the contract-mandated holiday period of Dec. 25 through Jan. 1, and it was questionable whether production could be back at full speed by then. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 751 here, said it may take time for the membership to get over bitterness from the strike. Many workers `` always thought the company would take care of them,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Monday night. `` They found that was not the case.'' `` I do n't think you're going to find many ill feelings,'' <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said, adding that one reason for the crew meetings is to get any such feelings out in the open. `` I think from what I've seen, people are all ready, eager and willing to get back at work,'' he said. The last <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strike, in 1977, ended after 45 days. Its longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948.

 Backers of sweeping changes in the way <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimburses physicians said Tuesday the plan, if it becomes law, will change the way medicine is practiced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The compromise plan, worked out by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators Monday as part of the budget reconciliation bill, would have no immediately discernible impact on the 33 million elderly and disabled Americans who receive Medicare. Over the longer term, however, supporters say the plan would improve Medicare beneficiaries' access to medical services and would help stabilize the costs of the program, which have been climbing more than 15 percent a year and are expected to reach $ 44 billion this year. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was working toward final passage of the overall bill Tuesday. `` It's the beginning of a fundamental change in physician behavior patterns,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, an architect of the `` Within the next three or four years, there is really going to be significant change ... in terms of procedures, volume of procedures, which is what drive up the cost of Medicare,'' he said. The result, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> said, would be a greater emphasis on less expensive primary care, including preventive care. Although the changes would begin with the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> said private insurance companies, which also are trying to rein in the costs of medical care, likely would implement the changes eventually because `` medicine follows Medicare'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> supports the plan as a cost-stabilizing measure. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapp </PERSON>, the association's director of government relations, said beneficiaries probably would n't notice a difference in care. Opponents, however, say the plan would lead to rationing of health care and a decline in the quality of services. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Haislmaier </PERSON>, a health-care policy analyst at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said that the plan may initially level out costs but that it does not contain the incentives necessary to control expenditures over the long term. Over time, it could lead to rationing of medical services, he said, adding, `` It's not going to happen tomorrow, but you're setting the stage for it. The plan, to be phased in over five years beginning in 1992, includes a new payment schedule for reimbursing physicians who treat <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients. Now, reimbursements are based on a doctor's customary charges, which can have little relationship to cost and can vary from region to region. The new rates would boost fees for family and general-practice physicians and internists. Fees would be lowered for surgeons, radiologists and other specialties that are procedure-based. The fees would be standardized by specialty, with geographic adjustments designed to account for regional differences in costs. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, the leading professional organization for internists, backs the plan, saying the fee schedule `` will neutralize incentives for physicians to practice a very high-tech oriented style of medicine,'' helping to moderate future increases in Medicare costs. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment in detail until its officials read the final language of the measure, but she said that `` right now, we're very favorable.'' `` This group realizes the world is different and there's a certain reality out there,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. `` There's a lot of concern with the costs of medicine ... -LRB- and -RRB- there has to be belt tightening All health-care sectors are going to be affected.'' Another part of the plan attempts to slow the increase in payments to physicians and to control the volume of services they provide by linking increases in physician payments to a Medicare spending goal. If physician payments exceed the goal, reimbursement rates could be cut. The plan also requires physicians to submit claims for beneficiaries. Some now require the patient to pay the bill and seek reimbursement from Medicare. Also, the plan continues but simplifies limits on how much physicians can charge <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients over the amount they will be reimbursed by the program.

 <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it was considering a debt-financed recapitalization, a defensive move against <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s recent unsolicited $ 1.1 billion bid to buy the chemical manufacturer. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> said in a vaguely worded statement it had decided a recapitalization was the best way for the company to benefit its stockholders. The company did not disclose any details of its plans. It said a special shareholders meeting would be called once arrangements were made. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> said it had considered other alternatives to <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 50 a share bid, which was announced Oct. 31 and has since expired <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> said it had discussed the possibility of a business combination with or acquisition of the chemical maker by third parties who had expressed interest in the firm. `` A leveraged recapitalization, among the various transactions under consideration, would be the most favorable to the company's stockholders,'' <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> said Under a leveraged recapitalization, a company usually borrows a significant amount of money and uses it to pay shareholders a dividend or expand the business. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>'s 25.6 million outstanding shares, offered last month to buy the rest of the company for $ 1.1 billion During the summer, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who controls <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION>, said his holdings in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> were no longer for the sole purpose of investment. <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Tuesday it was willing to reinstate its offer, and also said it would support the proposed recapitalization if the deal would pay stockholders a higher amount than <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' $ 50 a share bid <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> said it was leaving its options open, and would consider either adding to or reducing its <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> stake depending on future events. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the proposed recapitalization could result in the price of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>'s stock increasing to about $ 55 a share. But in the absence of any details about the recapitalization, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> shares skidded in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. The company's stock fell $ 6.12 -LCB- to $ 46.25 a share. Raising the stock price, and the value of his holdings, by forcing a recapitalization may have been what <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> wanted all along, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` I think a recap at $ 55 ends the -LRB- takeover -RRB- story,'' said <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who previously characterized <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' bid as an attempt to drive the stock price up. `` A recapitalization was the most likely outcome in the first place.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement was obviously a defensive step, but he said it was too soon to say if the strategy would take NL out of the picture. He noted that `` nothing has been disclosed'' about the terms of the recapitalization. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> probably decided against a merger because of antitrust considerations. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1985 when <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> divested itself of its commodity chemicals business. With 1988 sales of $ 1.06 billion, the company manufactures a variety of chemicals and polymers, including aromatic, natural gas and electrochemical products, as well as thermoplastic and thermosetting resins.

<HEAD>Mediation Board Again Orders Teamsters Election at USAir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal agency on Tuesday ordered an election to determine whether an estimated 8,000 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> fleet service workers will be represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, the third such election in eight years. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the new election was necessary because many of the fleet service workers, who handle <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s baggage, catering and field operations, were non-union workers with <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> prior to the August merger of the two carriers `` It's disgraceful we have to go through this election again,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> division, said in a statement. `` But we've beaten this company twice and we can do it again.'' Attempts to reach <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> for comment Tuesday were unsuccessful; word of the decision was received after the airline's <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> headquarters had closed for the day. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> said the addition of the former <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> workers would make it the largest union election in the private sector in four years. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> won an election among the fleet service agents in 1981 but a new vote was ordered last year because of of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s subsequent purchases of several smaller carriers The Teamsters again prevailed. In ordering the new election, the <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rejected arguments by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> that since <PERSON> Piedmont </PERSON>' a work force was smaller than the number of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> workers already represented by the Teamsters the new workers should have automatically fallen under the union's jurisdiction. Genoese contended <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> sought the election because it hopes to decertify the union and then contract out the work. Three other unions representing <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> workers, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> gained representation rights of the former <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> workers without elections. <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, are the two cities with the largest number of affected workers, about 1,100 in each city, both of which are major <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> hubs. In all, approximately 8,000 workers at 147 airports in virtually every state are eligible to vote in the election. Ballots will be mailed out within 45 days and workers have 30 days to return them. Only those workers in favor of union representation have to return the ballots; those not returned are counted as `` no'' votes. The union must get votes from 50 percent a the work force, approximately 4,000, to win the election.

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the central figure in an influence peddling investigation involving the nation's biggest savings and loan failure, refused to testify before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee Tuesday. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, who serves as chairman of the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irvine </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, cited his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. `` On the advice of counsel, I respectfully exercise my constitutional prerogative and privilege and refuse to answer questions here today,'' the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Keatin </PERSON> also rebuffed reporters' shouted questions in entering and leaving the committee room. But the parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, released a statement in which he challenged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do a better job in its investigation and added that he had doubts it `` is really up to the task.'' Earlier Tuesday, the nation's top thrift regulator said elected politicians to whom <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> contributed millions of dollars since buying <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in 1984 had no influence on his decision in 1987 against immediately seizing the savings and loan. `` No political figure influenced my decision,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, director of the new Office of Thrift Regulation and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that preceded it as the industry's regulator. `` I do n't know how I can say that more emphatically.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee last week hired an outside counsel to investigate allegations that five senators who received $ 1.3 million in political gifts from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> improperly intervened with regulators on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s behalf. All five _ Sens. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> _ have denied violating any laws or ethics rules of At Tuesday's hearing, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> invoked a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule allowing him to bar broadcasting of his remarks by television and radio and to forbid still photographers from taking pictures. However, the committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, allowed coverage of him swearing in <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> as a witness. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> also asked the committee to invoke another rule that would have allowed it to hear what he had to say in a closed executive session but withdrew the request after several congressmen raised questions about the procedure. After his appearance, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> issued a release saying <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> invoked the Fifth Amendment `` most reluctantly and stated that he is hopeful he can freely testify before the committee in the near future.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is the subject of a federal grand jury probe in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and has been sued by federal regulators in a $ 1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suit. In the statement, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should `` provide more than mere lip service to its investigation and ... ferret through the real facts.'' `` I am not sure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is really up to the task,'' he said. Wall told the committee he had made mistakes regarding the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> case from the time he assumed the bank board's chairmanship in July 1987 until it was taken over by regulators last April. Government officials have put the cost to taxpayers of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s failure at $ 2.33 billion _ a figure that Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said represents `` $ 50 for every family in this country. `` Clearly, had we known then what we know now, we would have acted differently,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> regulators and mid-level officials in Wall's agency have testified in previous hearings that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s political influence hampered their efforts to uncover and stop what <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> on Tuesday called a `` heist'' of federally insured deposits in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>. Wall said lawmakers had spoken with him on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L and its owner, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But he said his decisions `` were devoid of any political influence,'' and he added, `` I was not under the spell of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>.'' Wall acknowledged receiving telephone calls from <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Ky., about <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s efforts to sell <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> earlier this year before the government seized `` But those calls were well within the limits of propriety,'' he said. `` Their inquiries were for a status report or to urge action, but in no way were they attempts to tell me what action to take.'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, the fourth-ranking Democrat on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, vigorously defended his action at the opening of the hearing, saying he called Wall only at the request of former Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousselot </PERSON>, R-Calif., who was then trying to arrange a sale of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> chastised Wall for rejecting a May 1987 recommendation from field examiners in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office to seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> then. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` sounded an eight-alarm warning ... -LRB- but -RRB- for 23 months and two weeks -LRB- <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- failed to take definitive and effective action,'' said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who has asked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to fire Wall. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> faulted <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> regulators for failing to `` sense who they were dealing with in <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>,'' whom he accused of using <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> like an automatic teller machine as a source for cash. Wall defended his rejection of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> examiners' suggestion, saying they had `` found smoke but no fire. But he admitted that, in hindsight, he erred in postponing a scheduled field examination of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s offices in September 1987 after the thrift threatened to get a court order to bar entry. `` You can second-guess yourself to the point of distraction,'' he said. At the time `` we were on the brink of disaster in the thrift industry'' and `` <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was just barely on our scope.'' In turn, Wall blamed the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> staff for approving a tax-sharing agreement drafted by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, that he said allowed it to illegally `` drain $ 95 million'' from the thrift between April 1986 and July 1988. `` The heist was halted,'' he said, only after <ORGANIZATION> Ban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> acted on a tip from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state regulators and launched a new examination of their own, both into <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and its holding company.

<HEAD>Bank Plans $50 Million Charge for Previously Disclosed Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it plans to take a $ 50 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter in connection with allegations of fraud reported earlier at its <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, office. The banking company, which also previously disclosed it had dismissed an officer at the branch as a result of the allegations, said an investigation was continuing and that the bank is working with <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities. It said the charge, which amounts to $ 35 million after taxes, resulted from losses on foreign exchange trading for customer accounts, interest to be paid on such accounts and embezzlement. The bank's <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> office is principally engaged in asset management for individuals. Last month, Swiss police arrested a former Manufacturers Hanover investment banker in connection with an embezzlement that they said amounted to $ 2.2 million from the bank's <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> office. Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment at the time on the amount of money embezzled, but said that losses like those incurred at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> office are normally covered by insurance and do not affect earnings. The bank said Tuesday it would seek to minimize the loss through recoveries and insurance. Manufacturers Hanover earned $ 224 million, or $ 4.28 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1988. That was an exceptionally strong performance, however, as the results included $ 146 million in past-due interest payments on loans to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Tuesday recommended that its stockholders reject <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s sweetened $ 3.6 billion takeover bid, saying it was still too low and was illegal. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which on Sunday increased its offer to $ 63 a share from $ 58 a share, responded that it would continue its pursuit of the paper products company. In a letter Sunday to <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the new offer represented a 63 percent premium above Great Northern's share price before <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s original $ 3.1 billion offer was made Oct. 31. But <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON>, in a letter to shareholders Tuesday, said: `` The modest increase in the price of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s offer, announced on Nov. 19, has done nothing to change your board's determination that the offer is not in the best interests of your company and its shareowners.'' Also, <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said his company's attorneys maintain the deal would violate antitrust laws. He said the board has determined, with the advice of the company's financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, `` that the increased per - share price of the offer remains inadequate. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON>'s contentions in a statement Tuesday. `` A $ 5 increase certainly is not modest,'' he said. `` I wonder how many of Great Northern's shareholders agree that a 63 percent premium above the unaffected market price is inadequate,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said it would continue its effort to present the bid to Great Northern stockholders. Great Northern rejected the first offer as too low, illegal on antitrust grounds and potentially disastrous for the combined company. Great Northern filed an antitrust suit in federal court. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s Sunday letter disputed Great Northern's contentions about the deal's financial implications. He also demanded a special meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and urged <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> to meet with him personally to discuss the proposal. `` We are prepared to consider an additional increase in price if you come to the negotiating table early and demonstrate to our satisfaction that greater value exists,'' he wrote. Prior to <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> filed an amended lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, accusing Great Northerns's directors of shirking their duty to shareholders by ignoring the tender offer The lawsuit also accuses Great Northern directors of plotting to thwart the takeover by setting up `` golden parachutes,'' to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to executives in the event they lose their jobs in a takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which employs 44,000 people, had revenue of $ 9.5 billion last year from sales of paper, other forest products and building materials. It is based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, Conn.-based Great Northern, with 20,000 workers and 1988 sales of $ 3.6 billion, makes paper, containers and envelopes. The amended lawsuit claims that after <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> made the offer, <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> `` refused to take even the minimal steps necessary to begin to apprise himself of the potential benefits to shareholders of a negotiated resolution -LRB- or even simply of further talks -RRB-, benefits about which he could not possibly have known, much less conclusively evaluated.'' It also accuses Great Northern of setting up a `` tin parachute'' plan that could cost millions of additional dollars in payments to some 5,850 non-union employees who might lose their jobs in a takeover. Laidig disputed the contention that extra compensation voted by the board was a `` golden parachute'' plan. The original lawsuit, amended by Tuesday's filing, challenged <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s by-laws and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover statute, which require hostile suitors to wait five years before they take over a company, unless the directors of the target company approve the deal.

<HEAD>Creditors' Agreement Staves Off Liquidation Order in Hunt Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former billionaires <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> on Tuesday filed a joint $ 105 million reorganization plan approved by their major creditors, who have been at odds for months. Attorneys for the Hunts and for <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> signed the plans and filed them in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Other creditors have until Dec. 15 to file objections. The reorganization agreements could head off a bankruptcy judge's threat to convert the brothers' bankruptcies from Chapter 11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation of their assets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> notified all parties two weeks ago that without an agreement by Nov. 20 he would convert the cases to Chapter 7 status. The agreements filed Tuesday were reached verbally Monday following hours of closed-door meetings, after which <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> said he would defer the liquidation order until Dec. 15. Several of the attorneys said Tuesday the plan would n't have come about without such pressure. `` It was a combination of the judge ordering conversion of <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>'s case as well as the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> telling us that if we did n't have plans by the end of the year ... they would seek conversion of the case,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Houser </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bankruptcy attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>, a mining company owned by the Peruvian government. Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, a debtor is allowed to continue to operate with protection from creditors' claims while a debt repayment schedule is arranged Under Chapter 7, assets are sold to pay creditors. According to bankruptcy court filings, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> has $ 169 million in assets and Bunker has assets of $ 250 million. Under terms of the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would get 70 percent of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>'s estate, valued at $ 125 million, and unsecured creditors would get another 30 percent. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> would pay 80 percent of his estate, valued at $ 150 million, to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and 20 percent to unsecured creditors. The Hunts would be able to keep their personal effects, but <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> ordered an auction of a coin collection and antiques. Major creditors said they would have received nothing under a fire-sale Chapter 7 liquidation, and most of the money from the estates would have gone to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. `` We could n't be happier,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON>, head attorney for <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who had asked for a delay in <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>'s conversion order The compromise between Manufacturers Hanover and <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> refocuses both cases away from liquidation. Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover are each to receive 34.6 percent _ or $ 36.6 million _ of each brother's estate. The total of all allowed claims is $ 105.8 million. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> has been trying to collect a $ 132 million court judgment against the brothers stemming from their alleged attempt in 1979-80 to corner the silver market, which ended with the collapse of silver prices. With attorneys' fees and interest, the judgment has swelled to more than $ 250 million. Other creditors _ led by <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>, which is owed $ 36 million _ have argued that <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> already has recovered its silver losses from other third-party defendants and that the money would be better spent paying other creditors. <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> has allowed only $ 20 million of the Peruvian mining concern's claim.
