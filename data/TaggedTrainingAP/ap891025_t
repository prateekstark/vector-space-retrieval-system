 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday sent President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a $ 3.45 billion relief package, the largest ever for a single disaster, to help Northern Californians rebuild homes, businesses and roads shattered by last week's earthquake. Final approval in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> came on a vote of 303-107, hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted its consent 97-1. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had sweetened a $ 2.85 billion version of the bill passed Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by making an additional $ 600 million of <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> disaster loans available to companies hurt by the quake. `` This is a tremendous amount of good will,'' Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., who helped lead his state congressional delegation's efforts to win federal aid, told his `` We thank all of you.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would sign the bill first thing Thursday morning. That was virtually a necessity, largely because the measure was attached to legislation allowing the government to continue functioning through its latest fiscal crisis. Even though the government's authority to spend money technically expired at midnight, all federal employees were to report to work as usual on Thursday morning, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. The assistance was directed at what appears to have been the costliest natural disaster in American history, with damage estimates now exceeding $ 7.1 billion. The Oct. 17 quake _ measured at 7.1 on the Richter scale _ killed 63 people, with 9 unaccounted for, 3,000 injured, and nearly 14,000 homeless. The earthquake measure comes on the heels of a $ 1.1 billion relief package approved last month to help victims of Hurricane Hugo, the previous federal assistance record for a single disaster. `` It is very likely that the ultimate federal cost ... may be higher as the damage estimates continue to grow,'' warned Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` But this is a very good, very important allocation for a community that has been very badly shaken. The aid was part of a must-pass bill to keep federal agencies in business for the next three weeks. Because only two of the 13 annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 have been enacted, the government's authority to spend money would otherwise expire at midnight Wednesday. Fiscal 1990 began Oct. 1. The earthquake relief portion provides $ 1.1 billion for housing, families' losses, damaged public property and other assistance through the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It makes available $ 1 billion for highway and bridge repair, creates a $ 250 million fund for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to distribute, and pours an additional $ 500 million into the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency loan pot, which previously contained $ 1 billion. It also increases by $ 600 million, to a total of $ 1.8 billion, the maximum amount of emergency loans which the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> is authorized to make. Though the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> would start with about $ 1.5 billion in its emergency pool, it could issue loans up to the $ 1.8 billion figure as the pool is replenished by repayments. `` People who are dislocated from their homes and businesses need that assistance now,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif. At the insistence of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawmakers, the measure also clears away several bureaucratic hurdles that would have restricted the assistance It makes the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, where a section of road collapsed, eligible for federal assistance. Because it is a toll road, it would not have otherwise qualified. It also extends from 90 to 180 days the period in which <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would not have to provide state funds to be eligible for federal assistance. In addition, $ 20 million of the funds would be used to study earthquakes and techniques to prepare for them. The quake was centered on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> fault, in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> 56 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Some money in the bill could be used to help victims of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and about 19 other disaster areas that still qualify for federal assistance. The lion's share, however, is intended for victims of the earthquake. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, cast the sole vote against the bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, saying he did so because it exceeded the $ 2.5 billion sought by the administration and would fuel the nation's deficit Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, did not vote

 State prison inmates took eight guards hostage and set four fires in a seven-hour riot touched off when a prisoner assaulted a staff worker, officials said. At least 42 people, mostly prison employees, were injured. The disturbance at the medium-security <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> began at 3 p.m. and ended shortly before 11 p.m., Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said. `` The incident at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is over. We are fully in control of the institution,'' he said. The injured included 35 guards or staff people, five inmates, including one who had been stabbed with a screwdriver, one firefighter and one state trooper, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Palakovich </PERSON>, assistant to the prison superintendent. The hostages were released by 9 p.m., but prison officials did not say how long they had been held. Formal negotiations between the inmates, who carried home-made weapons, and a team of prison guards began at 6 p.m. and the first hostages were released at 8 p.m., <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said. The inmates had demanded a press conference, changes in medical care and family visit rules and amnesty, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said. In response to the demands, the superintendent said he plans to meet with a group of inmates on Wednesday. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said some of the hostages had been beaten and received medical treatment, but he had no details on their condition. All cell blocks were secure and all but one fire was extinguished by 10 p.m., <PERSON> Palakovich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Palakovich </PERSON> said the disturbance began after a staff member was assaulted by an inmate at the E gatehouse. The incident carried over to two nearby cellblock areas. Fires were started at the prison furniture factory, a commissary and another food service area, <PERSON> Palakovich </PERSON> said. A reporter for The Patriot-News said she saw a number of inmates try to crash a truck through a rear gate. There was no official confirmation of that account, but witnesses said the truck did not get through the fence. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said the riot was apparently ignited by inmate anger over a recent prison ban on inmates' families bringing in homemade food, out of fears it was being used to hide contraband. The prison has 2,607 inmates, about 45 percent over capacity. The 52-acre complex about three miles from <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> was opened in 1941 as a youth detention center and converted to adult population in 1976. The Camp Hill riot came only two days after a disturbance at the <LOCATION> Huntingdon </LOCATION> state prison injured 29 staff members and 19 prisoners. Inmates took over a cellblock Monday night for three hours, breaking windows, destroying furniture and setting several small fires, authorities said. Huntingdon is about 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. State Police Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walp </PERSON> said 200 troopers from several barracks had been sent to help quell the disturbance at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Eight people, including six guards, a prison worker and a state trooper, were taken to <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said spokeswomen <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>. Four of the patients were released. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, a prison guard, was admitted with an eye injury in fair condition. Fifteen prison employees were taken to <LOCATION> Holy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spirit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with minor lacerations and one broken ankle, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisinger </PERSON>. Fourteen were treated and released. Two patients were transported by helicopter to the <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Saline </PERSON> said both were in fair condition. One patient, a guard, had injuries to the face, eye, ear and blows to the chest, Ms. <PERSON> Saline </PERSON> said. The other was an inmate who had a stab wound to the shoulder, she said. One guard was in intensive care at <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osteopathic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with multiple injuries, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Witkowski </PERSON>, nursing supervisor.

 Outrage grew Wednesday over the robbery-killing of a pregnant suburban lawyer and the wounding of her husband, while their baby born by Caesarean section struggled for survival. In housing developments, in posh hotels, in student haunts and in the streets, the talk was of the attack on <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>, who were abducted as they left a childbirth class at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital Monday night. Their assailant forced them to drive into the inner city area bordering the hospital. There the assailant robbed the couple and shot <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> in the abdomen, his 33-year-old wife in the head. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 29, remained in critical condition Wednesday, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> spokesman said. Late in the day, Police Superintendent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Saia </PERSON> said detectives had been able to narrow the list of suspects `` down to a chosen few'' after speaking to <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> at his hospital bedside. More than 400 people gathered Wednesday evening for a memorial Mass at a church in the same inner-city neighborhood were the attack occurred. `` The community wanted to pray for the families. We thought a Mass would be the best way to do that,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Krastel </PERSON>, rector of the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` It hit home,'' <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney, said Wednesday as he made his way through the downtown shopping district, miles from the site of the crime. `` It's not a suburban story. It's not about rich and poor. It's not made-for-television fiction. I just called my son, who takes guitar lessons on Tremont Street -LRB- near the shooting -RRB- and told him to be careful.'' In the <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> area, where police found the couple shot and slumped in their car, 23-year old <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> was standing outside a liquor store with a friend Wednesday. `` The man who did it should be taken out. We got to get the death penalty back. The guy was foul. He had no heart,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. At a downtown cutlery store, proprietor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> said his employees could talk about nothing but the crime and its brutality. `` It's almost too hard to look,'' the 73-year-old merchant said, `` because of its enormity and the fact that it's so needless.'' <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 29-year-old general manager of a fur store, used a car phone to call police. Family members said the telephone was installed in Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s car after she became pregnant so she could remain in touch with her husband. Several hours after the shooting, a son, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, was born. The mother died shortly after the birth. Hospital spokeswomen would only say Wednesday that the infant was alive. Family members said the baby had suffered seizures and there was diminishing hope for his survival. Neonatal experts said an infant delivered by Caesarean section 32 weeks after conception, as <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> was, should have a 98 percent chance of surviving. But Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s loss of blood in the shooting was said to harm the child's chances. `` He looked perfect. They told us to stroke his face because they said he would need a lot of love,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s aunt, <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON>, said after seeing the baby. `` <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> had been having a wonderful pregnancy. She wanted this baby so badly. But they do n't think there's much hope for him.''

 Uncertain times lie ahead for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s movie industry, which faces new political constraints just as a generation of young, ambitious directors strives to compete on international screens. Like others in the art world, studio heads and directors are waiting to see the full impact of the crackdown on liberalism that has followed the June crackdown on student-led demonstrations for democratic reform. The early signs have not been encouraging. The central government's <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises all movies, has fired the head of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Film Studio for unspecified political errors, and sent in a special team led by bureau director <PERSON> Teng </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingxian </PERSON> to `` rectify'' the studio. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>, in charge of censorship at the bureau, said he sent `` urgent telegrams'' this fall to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s two most innovative studios, the <ORGANIZATION> Xian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Film </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Studio </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, warning them to `` pay special attention to problems in ideological tendencies.'' Asked what that meant, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> laughed and said, `` When they see -LRB- the warning -RRB-, they understand.'' Film officials did not even try to select this year's best movie in the Golden Rooster competition, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s politically charged version of the Academy Awards. The selection was hard enough in past years, when awards were sometimes delayed for months while officials debated the political merits of films nominated for artistic reasons. This year, officials said no movies were acceptable. All studios, like other work units, have been ordered to hold special classes to study recent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> documents on the battle against `` bourgeois liberalism,'' or anti-socialist ideas, and the need for art to serve socialism. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the classes take up two half-days a week _ far more than ordinary work units. Two of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading film directors were overseas when the crackdown began, and one, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaige </PERSON>, has said he wo n't return. He plans to make a documentary about the June army attack on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> protesters, in which hundreds and possibly thousands were killed. The other, <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> studio head <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tianming </PERSON>, has not been in touch with his studio since he left for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in April to attend the opening of a joint Chinese-Canadian movie about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first emperor. Studio officials say they do n't know if <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> will return, and <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> acknowledged it was `` hard to say'' if <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> would be allowed to keep his job if he did. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>'s blunt criticisms of government censors long have gotten him in trouble, and his studio's movies have angered some officials by depicting rural poverty and mindless bureaucracy. But the debt-ridden studio in arid, impoverished northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also has won more international prizes than any other studio, beginning with <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>'s 1987 `` Old Well,'' which won awards in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The movie's frank depiction of rural poverty and daring story of a love triangle set off a small storm within the Chinese movie industry, more accustomed to socialist morality tales. Young directors at other studios joined the movement to make realistic movies of modern life, adopting film techniques from abroad, and critics said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s film industry had finally matured. No movies of the new school have been released since the June crackdown, only epics of the Communist revolution timed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its victory in October 1949. But <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON>, vice president of the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> studio, said in an interview that the <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> recently approved a movie the studio shot before June depicting smuggling and other illegal activities. Last spring, <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> released what it billed as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` first sex movie,'' a story of love and marriage in a 1940s fishing village `` I think we can still make this kind of movie,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said. But the studio will no longer test the censors by sending them love scenes it thinks likely to be cut _ it will make the cuts itself, he said. Directors <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueshu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaowen </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> studio also said they hope to continue their experimental work. `` Movements happen. We are used to them,'' <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> said. If the government insisted on changing a movie he made, he added boldly, `` I'd resign.'' `` And start your own studio?'' <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> asked him sarcastically.

 <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> provokes outrage, admiration, bewilderment, and few <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> who follow foreign affairs are neutral about the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister. From the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in distant <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> this week, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> consolidated her status as a dominant figure in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political disputes. Her determined opposition to tougher economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was praised by conservative whites and denounced by anti-apartheid leaders. `` Thank you, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>,'' said an editorial Tuesday in The Citizen, a pro-government <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> daily. `` We South Africans appreciate your brave, honest and lone battle against sanctions.'' President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, in a speech Monday night, lauded the leader of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and said intensified sanctions would undermine his proposals for political reform. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, a senior spokesman for the anti-apartheid movement, said with understatement that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s position `` does not coincide with ours.'' <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>, a black trade union leader, said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> went to the summit `` to defend the apartheid regime.'' The 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, composed of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies, adopted a declaration Sunday calling for tougher financial measures against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and giving the white-led government six months to fulfill promises to dismantle apartheid. The declaration incorporated Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s objections but an hour later, to the dismay of other participants, she issued a separate statement outlining her reasons for dissent. She said tougher sanctions will hurt <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s blacks and increase white resistance to <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s reform program. On Tuesday she told a news conference in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, `` I am in step with the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a former British colony, withdrew from the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> in 1961 as other members increased their demands that it end its policies of racial separation. Business Day, a Johannesburg-based financial newspaper often critical of the government, said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> performed more honorably at Kuala Lumpur than two pro-sanctions advocates, Prime Ministers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> `` have found in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a rare opportunity for moral posturing,'' Business Day said. `` They do n't know or care what harm they do. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has `` the good sense to recognize fundamental changes when they occur, sufficient faith in human nature to dare to hope for better times, and the courage to back her judgment,'' the editorial said. `` That is why she towers over men like <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>; even if she turns out in the end to be wrong, at least she is not a pygmy.'' By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate residential districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Catholic Church Drawing Fire For Stepping Into Rome Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A century after the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> lost control of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, politicians are accusing it of still trying to control the city's politics The charge stems from a speech by a top church administrator, the papal vicar for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, suggesting that the city's voters choose the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s only church-linked party _ in mayoral elections this weekend. The appeal by Cardinal <PERSON> Ugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Poletti </PERSON> has sparked a national outcry about <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> involvement in Italian politics. `` We seem to have returned to the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> of the popes,'' commented <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, leader of the Socialist party. The debate underlines how powerful religion is considered even in a city that appears overwhelmingly secular, with low Mass attendance, porno movie houses and condom ads on buses. It has overshadowed such pressing concerns as traffic, pollution, social services and housing. <PERSON> Poletti </PERSON> came under attack particularly for saying voters should make `` courageous'' choices `` even at the expense of personal sacrifice or repugnance.'' His statement was interpreted as calling for support for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> despite the fact that successive city governments led by the party have been embroiled in scandal. `` It is worrying ... that Cardinal <PERSON> Poletti </PERSON> invites people to vote for the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- even when they feel repugnance,'' said <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Malfa </PERSON>, leader of the small Republican party. Since July, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> has been run by a special commissioner named by the national government after <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Giubilo </PERSON> resigned. <PERSON> Giubilo </PERSON> had been accused of steering contracts for school lunches to friends. He denied he did anything wrong. While the elections are simply to choose a city council, which in turn elects the mayor, they have major symbolic significance both for the church and the Italian political parties. The Oct. 29-30 ballot is the first since the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> won back control of city hall in 1985 after nine years of rule by the Communists, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-biggest party. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> was embarrassed by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule in the city of popes and unhappy about several Communist policies, such as extension of abortion services. Consequently it is anxious to see a party espousing Catholic values returned to city hall. Political parties, meanwhile, see the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> elections as a barometer of their popularity nationwide and a chance to land a high-profile post. The importance of the vote has prompted several parties to send top politicians including Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat, to stump for mayoral candidates. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> sailed down the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to promote his man, Tourism Minister <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Carraro </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> controlled the city of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for 400 years until Italian unification hero <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garibaldi </PERSON>'s troops entered the city in 1870. But the church has long kept a hand in Italian politics, and its support of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> has been credited with helping keep the Communists out of national government for more than four decades. Much of the church's traditional influence, however, has waned in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> as Western European society has become more secular. Less than 25 percent of the population attends Mass regularly in the city that is the world center of Catholicism. Only about 72 percent of marriages in the Italian capital this year were in church, even though around 90 percent of the population calls itself <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, according to figures from city hall and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> organization <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION>. Still, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is considered a powerful political force in the <LOCATION> Eternal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Turin-based newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stampa </ORGANIZATION> recently surveyed the strength of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s religious orders and lay <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> organizations and concluded they comprised around 60,000 people. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> has 2.3 million eligible voters. More than 39 percent of Romans questioned in a survey in the Italian newsmagazine <ORGANIZATION> Panorama </ORGANIZATION> felt Cardinal <PERSON> Poletti </PERSON>'s appeal would have `` a lot'' or `` some'' influence on the votes of Catholics. The latest controversy came as the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has been sparring with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> politicians over conditions in the capital. In February, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> urged city officials to stop squabbling among themselves. He described <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> as a `` city of two faces,'' where wealth and poverty exist side by side. Both <PERSON> Poletti </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> newspaper Osservatore Romano were critical of <PERSON> Giubilo </PERSON>, the mayor who resigned. The fact that <PERSON> Poletti </PERSON> urged support for the party he had been criticizing was not lost on politicians.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> likes to be where the action is when disaster strikes. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s wife wanted him out of her kitchen. Both retired, they are reservists for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> who help the agency stretch when the pressure is on. Last month they were helping victims of Hurricane Hugo. Now they're pulling 12-hours shifts at the Veterans Memorial Building in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> set up its disaster assistance center to handle applications for grants and low-interest loans. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 61, retired in June from the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, but has been a <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> reservist for three years. Before she retired, she saved up vacation time to work disasters. `` It's an organization that's there quickly and we like to be part of the action,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who is assistant manager of the disaster assistance center here. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, 78, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a retired associated professor of agricultural engineering, has been a reservist 12 years. `` My wife said she married for better or worse, but not for lunch,'' said <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>. `` She wanted to know, ` What are you going to do to stay out of my kitchen?''' Until recently, neither one had been sent to a disaster in more than a year and a half. On Sept. 1, <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to a flood. Three weeks later, he was sent to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, for Hurricane Hugo. A day at home and he was in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to help open an earthquake disaster assistance center. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was packed and ready to go to the Grand Canyon on vacation with her husband, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> reservist now working in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, when the call came Sept. 24 for <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. `` We split our clothes into two suitcases and off we went to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' she said. Three weeks later, they both were sent to help out with the quake. `` We had a beautiful spring and summer at home,'' she said. `` I have n't been home at all this fall.'' Both find getting their laundry done one of the biggest challenges. `` If you go to a Laundromat, that's an hour you could be sleeping,'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> said. Coast-to-coast diasters have stretched <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>, but it has n't snapped yet, said spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` I sure do n't want to see it strained much more, though,'' <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said. `` Right now I have laying on my desk a request for a disaster declaration from the state of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' where flood damages are estimated at $ 12 million, <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said. `` We're about to find out whether we can -LRB- meet more demands -RRB- or not.'' The agency has 3,000 people assigned to Hurricane Hugo and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake, he said. Of them, only 200 are full-time <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> employees. Six hundred are regular reservists who have been trained in advance and are called up in time of need. The remaining 2,200 are hired locally and get one day of training before being thrown in the breach. Hurricane damage has accounted for 350,000 disaster aid applications from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, 8,000 from the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, 51,000 from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and 2,800 from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said. A week after the earthquake struck <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, 10,000 applications have come in from the 12 disaster centers in seven counties, said <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rhoda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. More than 400 people of various specialties from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> have been dispatched from around the country to verify disaster claims before <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> signs checks. The total number of applications from <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and the earthquake alone amount to more than three years' worth under normal ccircumstances, <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think our people would ever admit they have reached their limit. Somewhere down the line you will run out of manpower, but I do n't know where that is,'' he said. `` Do you put together an agency that is big enough to handle the current situation, then sit around and do nothing for a year? That's not very effecive.'' Instead, <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> lets people like <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> do the sitting around. `` I just sit at home and rock slowly'til they call me,'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> said.

The charges resulted from a one-year investigation into the theft of Express Mail aboard <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. According to the indictment, the employees were instructed by a co-conspirator on how to take the contents from Express Mail envelopes. One Express Mail shipment contained 14 spools of 25-foot and 50-foot lengths of gold chains. Officials said the conspirators split the proceeds when the chains were sold. Several defendants were charged with removing marijuana and cocaine from the mail and distributing it to others.

The action halted a tandem $ 12 million fraud suit Mrs. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> had filed in federal court against the governor and two others. `` I'm pleased to have it behind us,'' the governor said in a statement. `` I think it's time to move forward.'' No details were released on the settlement, but Mrs. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Preiser </PERSON>, said as he left <PERSON> Canady </PERSON>'s office: `` Both cases have been settled Everybody's happy and she's extremely satisfied.'' `` You can underline extremely,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> added. In July, Mrs. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> filed for divorce and in August followed it up with her fraud suit, alleging she had been duped into selling her stock in the family insurance business for $ 2.98 million when the stock was worth far more.

 A study suggests the nutritional needs of women with eating disorders differ from those of normal women. A study by <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> found that women recovering from bulimia needed only 73 percent of the normal intake of calories. Conversely, women recovering from anorexia needed two-thirds more calories than normal. Bulimia is the disorder of gorging and purging. Anorexia is an avoidance of food. The study of 23 recovering bulimic women who were trying to maintain normal weight found that the women required only 10 calories per pound of body weight, or 73 percent of the 13.8 daily calories per pound that healthy women need. Separate studies involving 31 recovering anorexic women found they needed 22.3 calories per pound of body weight to maintain their normal weight. `` These findings have led to new treatment methods in our program ... and they help us to understand the physiological factors that complicate the psychological issues of eating disorders,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, director of the institute's Center for Overcoming Problem Eating The findings were published in a recent issue of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> and released to the public Tuesday in conjunction with Easting Disorders Awareness Week. The studies were conducted during the last three years, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> said.

 Please, does n't anybody out there love a bureaucrat? Last June, entrepreneur <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON> launched `` My Favorite Bureaucrat'' contest and invited people around the country to submit `` a brief, verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you.'' <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON> offered a $ 5,000 cash prize for the winning entry and figured he'd be swamped with nominations. After all, he says, there are plenty of federal, state and local bureaucrats to choose from _ about 15 million altogether. Today, <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON> is flabbergasted. In the past four months, he has received exactly one entry. Even worse, it was submitted by a woman employee of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> and Finance who nominated her boss. `` My God, I just ca n't believe the lack of response,'' said <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON>, the author of books and newsletters on where to get free advice from government experts on everything from playing the stock market to curing a backache to buying a new refrigerator. <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON> says he plugged the contest in thousands of news releases mailed from his suburban <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, office, on <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s radio show, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON>'s television show and the <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> cable TV network, and in speeches around the country promoting the dozen books he has written Besides the $ 5,000 prize for the contest winner, <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON> promised $ 500 to each of two runners-up, a plaque for the winning `` favorite bureaucrat'' and a free list of the government's two dozen best sources of information for every contest participant. `` I ca n't believe how this idea fell so flat,'' <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON> complained. He suspects the problem runs deeper than any lack of publicity. `` The government is the biggest source of information and help on anything you could want,'' he said. `` All the millionaires, like <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, use it. I even got free legal advice from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on how to run this contest. `` But the average guy in the street probably just hates the government, is intimidated by it and does n't think there's anything there but waste, fraud and abuse,'' <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON> said. `` The only contact most people have with the government is dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the division of motor vehicles, which are probably the two worst experiences anybody can have.'' The public's antagonism toward the government apparently is so virulent, <PERSON> Lesko </PERSON> said, that a contest to nominate the biggest bureaucratic bunglers probably would produce a flood of entries. `` I would n't do that to the Post Office,'' he said. Someone who understands the public's reluctance to identify helpful, competent bureaucrats is <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> humorist who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureaucrats </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are rather fearful of making such information public,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` If they say a bureaucrat has helped them, it's like saying they've seen a UFO in the sky. People might think they're not totally balanced.

 Explosions that may have been caused by illegal fireworks leveled one house and set two others on fire Tuesday, killing at least two people and injuring 13 others, authorities said. Crews worked into the night, searching the rubble for other possible victims of the blast, said Fire Chief Bim Orrenmaa. He said illegal fireworks were suspected as the cause of the explosions which rocked this city of 13,000 on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> at the northeast corner of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The fire chief initially said the explosion killed three people, but later revised the number to two, saying he had been incorrectly told that one injured person had died. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, an investigator with the <LOCATION> Ashtabula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office, confirmed two deaths. <PERSON> Orrenmaa </PERSON> said firefighters found devices that looked like fireworks in the home where the explosion and two subsequent blasts occurred just before noon. `` We had a lot of small bangs,'' before the big explosion and two subsequent blasts, <PERSON> Orrenmaa </PERSON> said. Students were evacuated from a nearby elementary school, but there were no other evacuations. Patrolman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Strine </PERSON> said the explosion blew out windows of at least 20 homes in a six-block area. The victims were not immediately identified. A 46-year-old woman who lived at the house where the explosions occurred was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Hamot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> DePalma </PERSON>. She was in satisfactory condition. Twelve people were taken to <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION>, then released, said hospital administrator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>. He said most of the injuries did not appear serious. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsolver </PERSON>, an agent with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, said 10 agents were at the scene. <PERSON> Kingsolver </PERSON> said that tubes, resembling parts of fireworks, were found.

 Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, acquitted in the murder of his wife after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed his conviction due to pretrial publicity, always feared he would be put back in prison, his son said. Ending 20 years of silence on the case, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said in a speech that he is speaking out in hopes of clearing his father's name `` Every reference to that -LRB- landmark <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- decision 23 years ago calls my father a convicted murderer,'' he said Tuesday, 35 years after his father was first brought to trial. `` That's not fair. That conviction was thrown out.'' The elder <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, an osteopath who was well known in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, was convicted of murder in the 1954 bludgeoning of his pregnant wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. He served nine years in prison before the nation's high court reversed the conviction. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> was acquitted after a second trial. He died in 1970 at age 46. The case remains unsolved. The younger <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, 42, had been long silent on the case until this week's speaking tour. On Tuesday, he spoke at <ORGANIZATION> Youngstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He was 7 years old at the time of the slaying, and lived with an uncle after after his father was imprisoned. After the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, the elder <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> feared constantly that he would be forced to return to prison, his son said. His exoneration in 1966 eased those worries but created new ones. `` There is still this stigma in our society that if you're accused, you're guilty,'' he said `` He could n't cope with society. ... He was a great guy, but, I kept my distance. I did n't want to go down with him. That was the agreement between us.'' <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said the person he believed responsible for his mother's killing was the same person who broke into his family's house two days before the slaying That person, he said, later was convicted in an unrelated slaying. He said he knew the identity of the alleged killer, but would not reveal the name to the audience. Last summer, police indicated they might consider re-opening the investigation into Mrs. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>'s slaying following the murder conviction of the <ORGANIZATION> Sheppards </ORGANIZATION>' one-time window washer. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberling </PERSON> was arrested in 1959 after being found with a large amount of jewelry belonging to <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> and her husband's brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. In August, <PERSON> Eberling </PERSON> told The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer from prison that he was familiar with the circumstances surrounding Mrs. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>'s death.

 Thieves who stole a specially bred golden retriever and left behind a pumpkin wo n't face criminal charges if they return the puppy unharmed, its owner says.

 Any effort by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to exercise a line-item veto will prompt a lawsuit by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> says. The line-item veto `` is an idea that many of us would resist very diligently,'' Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the civil and constitutional rights subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday after <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was considering such a move <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, is prepared to take such a step despite lack of specific constitutional authority `` to see if it works.'' Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called for a constitutional amendment to give him the ability to veto just one item in a bill while leaving the rest intact, such a proposal has never made much headway in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully for eight years to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to propose such a constitutional change to the states for ratification. Some legal scholars contend that line-item veto powers are implied in a president's overall veto power. However, the concept has never been tested. Such a notion, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said in an interview, comes from `` chit chat in conservative circles'' and has little constitutional legitimacy. `` We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test case, but at this point we do n't have one,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, adding that it was anticipated such a move would provoke a court challenge. Were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cast such a veto, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, `` a majority of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'' would promptly take him to court. However, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> conceded the issue could remain in limbo for years until it makes its way to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` Conservatives could have a field day,'' he said. `` They think they could get several years of line-item vetoes.'' Administration sources said it was unlikely the test case would come soon because there is nothing before the president that is a likely candidate. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a tentative target had been selected by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> _ a provision once in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill to ban a requirement that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> keep a log of contacts with lobbyists. However, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> stripped the provision from the bill before the president could decide whether to exercise a line-item veto. White House officials are keeping a sharp eye out, however, for another candidate. Sources said they are looking for a provision that is unrelated to the main bill, and on which a veto would not disrupt public policy or important services.

 Emergency crews searched the charred, twisted rubble of a plastics plant Tuesday looking for victims of fiery explosions that hurled wreckage miles away. At least two people were killed, 22 presumed dead and 124 injured. `` There's just nothing left,'' <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON> said after venturing into the still-smoldering plant No. 5 at the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> complex. Officials located but could not remove the body of a second victim Tuesday, partly buried in mounds of concrete and steel beams. They said it would take heavy equipment to fully search the ruins. One body was found Monday. Company officials in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> said late Tuesday that the 22 missing workers were presumed dead. `` Any employee in that wreckage probably did n't survive,'' said <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of public relations for <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. Later Tuesday, officials at the company's <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, headquarters said 19 Phillips employees were either dead or missing and four contract workers were missing _ for a total of 23. Spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON> could not explain the discrepancy in the victim totals. Fires that followed the blasts and were fueled by highly flammable chemicals had been contained in small areas. Only a thin column of smoke rose from the plant Tuesday, 24 hours after the first explosions, which shattered windows three miles away and were felt 25 miles away. Some entire buildings inside the chemical plant complex had disappeared, <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON> said, and elsewhere pipes and metal framework were broken and dangling. `` It is devastated,'' <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON> said. `` Major, major damage. It's going to take extremely heavy equipment to remove the debris. `` The problem we're finding is that there are areas of the plant we just ca n't get to. We're going to have to bring in a bulldozer to make a road.'' <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON> and a crew of firefighters, safety inspectors and a medical examiner made the first foray into the ruins at the complex outside <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Frantic relatives gathered and scanned lists of known survivors Monday night. Many continued their vigil outside the plant Tuesday. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergne </PERSON>, 38, found the name of her husband, <PERSON> Cipriana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 43, on the list of missing workers. `` I had just taken him lunch,'' said Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergne </PERSON>. `` I heard the explosion when I was going back home.'' `` I can only keep on hoping,'' she said, collapsing into tears. Of the 124 people reported injured, 35 remained hospitalized Tuesday, with six in critical condition. Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s emergency medical director, said the patient in the worst condition was a woman with first - and second-degree burns over half her The plant, which produced 4.5 million pounds a day of polyethylene plastic used in everything from milk jugs to grocery sacks, erupted in a series of explosions that began just after 1 p.m. Monday, sending debris flying as far as six miles. The fire raged into the evening Monday, fueled by plastics and by ethylene and isobutane gases, which are both used to make plastics. By Tuesday it had been contained in small, controlled areas. `` We do n't feel there is any danger of further explosions,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` We're past that.'' As many as 400 firefighters battled the blaze. Water had to pumped from a sewage treatment plant and the nearby <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel after the explosions knocked out water service to the area. Officials arranged Tuesday to move hundreds of employees' cars that were damaged in the parking lot and hampered cleanup efforts. More than 900 people work in three shifts at the plant, built in 1948 on an 800-acre site, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON>, spokesman at <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. Workers whose jobs were affected by the explosion will continue to be paid, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, but some may be laid off later Officials did n't immediately know what caused the explosion. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> environmental director <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltz </PERSON> said a seal blew out on an ethylene loop reactor, in which chemical reactions take place to create polyethylene out of ethylene, a component of natural gas. The seal break released hydrocarbon vapor which ignited. `` There are 100 ways that could occur. We do n't know how the ignition occurred,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> President <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. The ethylene is fed to the plant through a pipeline from <LOCATION> Sweeny </LOCATION>, about 75 miles southwest of the plant in this town of 100,000 people. The pipeline was shut down after the blast. Inspectors from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> joined <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' emergency response team in assessing damages <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benz </PERSON>, plastic resins manager at the plant, said there was no immediate damage estimate. `` It'll be a big number,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Time is Money in Budget-Balancing Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> excused his lateness for an award ceremony for math teachers by joking he was busy `` trying to solve a few quadratic equations.'' He said the exercise was `` somewhat more difficult than balancing the budget.'' Having pretty much given up on the notion of balancing the budget any time soon, administration officials are trying to juggle a slew of budget-policy equations to gloss over a continuing impasse with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the math and science teachers gathered in the Rose Garden on Tuesday that he gets much of his scientific understanding from the comic strips. He cited a <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> cartoon `` where, after detailed calculations, <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> discovers that time is actually money.'' Time was money, in fact, in the federal response to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake. Last week's devastating quake gave rise to weekend speculation that the administration was considering some form of tax surcharge or increase _ most likely in the gasoline tax _ to help pay for a federal relief effort expected to cost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers around $ 3 billion. After all, that's a big chunk, and where was the money to come from in an already overburdened federal budget? The tax speculation was fueled by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own repeated failure to rule out a tax increase when asked by reporters about the prospects during his tour of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area's earthquake damage. However, it turned out that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ once again _ could stick with the `` no new taxes'' vow of the 1988 campaign. A quirk in the nation's budget laws allowed administration and congressional officials to `` find'' money for quake relief without having to face the issue of raising taxes. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' inability to agree on a deficit-reduction package for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 resulted in across-the-board cuts of $ 16.1 billion under the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law. But those cuts took effect Oct. 16 _ the day before the earthquake _ and there is no mechanism for further automatic budget reductions for another year. Thus, the Gramm-Rudman law `` is not applicable in this case,'' presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declared. `` It's a whole other ball game,'' he said. Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and congressional budgeters are finding other equations that, like <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, turn time, or at least delay, into money. For instance, by not counting the cost of the government's bailout of savings and loan institutions as part of the deficit, the `` real'' degree of red ink is understated And, the deficit is further made to look less menacing by another accounting gimmick involving Social Security funds. The current surplus in the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> _ a surplus that will vanish once baby-boom generation workers get to retirement age around the turn of the century _ is being used to help finance the deficit. The law requires money in the fund to be used to buy government securities, which in turn are largely used to finance the deficit. Not only are Social Security receipts being used to help retire the national debt, but the fact that there's a surplus in the account makes the deficit in other programs look smaller _ on paper. The `` real'' current budget deficit, discounting the Social Security surplus and putting back in the costs of the S & amp; L bailout and other programs now exempt, is closer to $ 250 billion than the $ 116.2 billion projected by the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't have much to say these days about the `` flexible freeze'' he talked about during his campaign. But, he told the math and science teachers: `` I had a friend who was so smart once that he knew how to convert meters to gallons. In his head.''

 Ten years and 1.5 million Afghan lives ago, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. This week, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called it a mistake. But <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> gave no indication that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was withdrawing its military support to the government created by the Soviet invasion. The current Afghan government `` was put in place as a result of the intervention that he now says was a contravention of moral norms,'' said <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, a specialist on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech to the Supreme Soviet on Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> admitted the 1979 invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` ignored universal human values'' and involved `` gross violations of our own laws.'' One-third of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pre-war population of 14 million has fled the country since the invasion, and about 70 percent of the nation's cities, villages and agricultural land have been destroyed, according to administration estimates. It is unusual but not unprecedented for the foreign minister of a superpower to acknowledge that a previous administration erred in wreaking such devastation on another country. <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, in confirmation hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> before he became President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s secretary of state in 1977, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was wrong `` In the light of hindsight, I believe it was a mistake to have intervened in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> testified, pledging `` not to mislead'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s predecessors had done in waging war in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> continued the detente of his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> predecessors, but rapprochement with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> fell apart when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> canceled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, embargoed the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and began to aid Afghan guerrillas. Despite <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s capitulation, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still has not granted diplomatic recognition to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s communist government, 14 years after the fall of the U.S.-backed government in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. Nor could <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> restore the lives of the 900,000 Vietnamese and 60,000 Americans who died in the conflict. And his statements did not mark a permanent change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made it clear he did not share <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s opposition to military intervention abroad, as he armed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra guerrillas, invaded <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and bombed the headquarters of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> accepted blame, whereas <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> did not. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> had been an architect of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, serving as <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> secretary and undersecretary of defense in the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> administrations. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in his speech, stressed that when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, he and the current Soviet leader, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, were non-voting members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>. `` I found out about what had happened from radio and newspaper reports. A decision that had very serious consequences for our country was made behind the back of the party and the people. We were confronted with a fait accompli,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. A private American specialist on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Selig </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said that during a trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in April he was told that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was an early opponent of the Afghan invasion, but there is little direct evidence of that. `` There was substantial disagreement from the beginning,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who in 1979 was the Politburo member in charge of agriculture, `` expressed objections to the diversion of funds to the war that had been programmed for agriculture,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew in February, Soviet military aid to the Afghan government headed by President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> has been estimated at $ 250 million to $ 300 million a month by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government analysts, and at up to $ 400 million a month by Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa., a harsh critic of the Kremlin By contrast, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been sending an estimated $ 500 million a year in military aid to mujahedeen guerrillas of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said, `` We welcome the Soviet admission and encourage them to take the next logical step to correct the Soviet mistake: Transfer of power from the illegitimate -LRB- <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> -RRB- regime to a government acceptable to all the Afghan people.''

<HEAD>`Zero Tolerance' Anti-Drug Program Relaxed Further</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is again easing the `` zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy _ which required immediate seizure of illegal drug users' cars and boats _ to let some people pay a fine and go on their way. `` Our goal and intent is still user accountability,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> senior special agent <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, who oversees the program along with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The changes are intended to `` streamline the program, make it more effective, more equitable,'' he said Tuesday. Officials hope the new guidelines will save time and money now spent on seizing cars, trucks and boats at the borders or in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territorial limits because small amounts of illegal drugs are found inside. This is the third easing in the zero tolerance program since it began March 21, 1988, with then-Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> declaring: `` There will be no mercy.'' Under the original rules, a driver heading across the border into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a small amount of marijuana in his car could be stopped and his auto seized by the government. If he wanted to get the car back immediately, he would have to pay the full value of the car plus any fines, said <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimkoski </PERSON>. The new guidelines were signed Oct. 18 by Acting Customs Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, but they were effective Oct. 11. The limits of drugs for which the new rules apply are an ounce of marijuana or hashish, a gram of cocaine, heroin or methamphetamine, one-tenth of a gram of PCP and 500 micrograms of LSD, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said. Under the new rules, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said, the car still could be seized by federal agents under certain circumstances, such as if the driver were impaired by the drug found in the car. More likely, the driver simply would be charged with a failure to report that he was bringing marijuana into the country. That violation required a penalty of $ 5,000 to $ 10,000, but the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has reduced that by 90 percent, he said. `` Realizing that that is not proportionate to the violation, the penalty would be $ 500 for the first offense, $ 1,000 for the second offense,'' <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said. `` If you pay that penalty at the time of the incident, you get in your car and drive away,'' he said. `` If you refuse to pay the penalty, the automobile will be seized, just as it was in the past, because we have made an offer of a mitigated penalty, which you have rejected.'' But forget putting the fine on Visa or MasterCharge. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does n't take plastic, only cash, a cashier's check or some other negotiable instrument, he said. If the car's owner had loaned the auto to someone else who was carrying a small amount of an illegal drug, the federal agent would decide on a case-by-case basis what would happen to the car, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said. Since the zero tolerance program began, Customs has seized 8,076 personal vehicles such as cars, pickup trucks and motorcycles, 452 commercial-type trucks, 190 boats and 13 aircraft, <PERSON> Shimkoski </PERSON> said. About 75 percent of the total value has been returned to its owners, excluding penalties. The new guidelines also change the policy for boats found with the user-amounts of drugs on board. Under the new guidelines, the owners of all boats with such drugs on board will be issued a summons requiring them to report to Customs in 15 to 30 days for handling of their case, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said. The government in February exempted fishing boats heading to or from fishing grounds from immediate seizure. Other boats, however, were subject to seizure, requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to bring the boats to shore, keep them safe and take in the owners. Under the first revision in the policy, made in May 1988, Customs or <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> authorities who found small amounts of drugs on boats more than 12 miles offshore would seize the boats only if they appeared to be transporting drugs into the country. The change was prompted by an outcry that erupted when the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the $ 2.5 million yacht <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> and the Monkey Business _ the pleasure boat that former presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> sailed on with model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> _ were seized when small quantities of drugs were discovered on board.

<HEAD>Senate GOP Proposes Eastern Europe Aid Package</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans who want to blunt Democrats' efforts to seize the upper hand on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are proposing their own three-year, $ 585 million program. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> struck back at critics of his aid program, saying in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that he's tired of complaints from `` people who found <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on the globe about three weeks ago. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, assembled by Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., and seven <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, was a middle ground between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 450 million proposal and an $ 837 million version passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week `` We do not believe the test of American policy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is how many dollars we spend, but how we can best achieve our national goals in those two countries,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in a statement. The issue was scheduled to come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor today. In an interview published in today's editions of the Times, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said changes taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are `` absolutely extraordinary, but I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this.'' `` Democrats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have been calling me ` timid,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I have other, better words, like ` cautious,' ` diplomatic,' ` prudent.''' An outline of the bill calls the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> approach `` generous, but fiscally prudent, rejecting the notion that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will benefit from a bidding war between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political parties.'' Democrats have criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s response to the sweeping changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and sought to demonstrate leadership by proposing a far more generous program. Democrats' higher aid figures `` make no economic sense at this point,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, contending that private enterprise will take time to evolve from the two countries' centrally planned economies. `` Just pouring aid dollars into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will not do the trick,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> proposal included some of the features of the House-passed legislation, which won strong bipartisan support. It would provide $ 200 million as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of a $ 1 billion international fund to stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy and $ 112 million in immediate food aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But instead of providing new money, it would require that the $ 200 million come out of the already tight foreign aid budget. Another $ 125 million would be used to support new private business ventures, including joint ventures with Americans. The House bill calls for $ 200 million in private enterprise support. The Republican alternative omits a $ 200 million guarantee fund the House version provides to underwrite sales to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP bill would make the aid specifically contingent on continuing transition toward democracy in the two countries and development of a free-enterprise economy. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has elected a government that for the first time in four decades is not controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Candidates of the Solidarity trade union dominate the new legislature. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has been making strides toward a more open political system as well, and has become the first Eastern European country to physically tear down fences dividing it from the West.

 Congressional negotiators who say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is shouldering a disproportionate share of the worldwide defense burden approved an $ 8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget for bases overseas. `` We've seen the peak for military construction spending,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on military construction Thwarted in earlier efforts to reduce troop levels overseas, members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> targeted money used for such items as barracks, munitions centers and storage facilities at military installations worldwide. Specifically, negotiators approved an $ 85.5 million cut from the $ 86.3 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have called for reductions in the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ an arrangement that costs the federal government $ 2.6 billion a year. The House is expected to act Thursday or Friday on the legislation, which members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittees on military construction approved by voice vote Tuesday. The bill, covering the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, provides $ 500 million less than this year's level for military construction but about $ 500 million more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, discussing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill last month, said the `` best way to make our defense dollar go further is to secure a more equitable burden sharing from our allies.'' Lawmakers agreed to cut all $ 40.8 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, basing the decision on upcoming negotiations on a new treaty to replace the Military Bases Agreement. The U.S.-Philippines pact under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> leases <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Bay Naval Base will expire in September 1991. Talks are expected to begin in December, and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said last month he was hopeful a `` mutually acceptable agreement will provide for a longtime stay by the Unites States.'' However, opposition to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence is strong. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was marked by demonstrations Hours before the vice president arrived, two American civilians were killed near a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base. Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to say whether she favors keeping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases, but she is expected to discuss the issue when she visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators also accepted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan to allocate $ 500 million to close 86 military facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, scale back five others and change the mission at 54 other installations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had requested $ 500 million.

<TEXT>
 New East German leader <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> `` ca n't turn the clock back'' to prevent major changes and the possibility of German reunification, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says. In an interview in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> characterized the changes as `` too inexorable'' to halt. The president also struck back at congressional critics of his aid program for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, saying he's tired of complaints from `` people who found <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on the globe about three weeks ago.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said changes taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are `` absolutely extraordinary, but I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this.'' He also said he does not share `` the concern that some European countries have about a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because I think <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s commitment to and recognition of the importance of the alliance is unshakable `` And I do n't see <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in order to get reunification, going off onto what some are concerned about, and that is a neutralist path that puts them at odds, or potentially at odds, with their <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners.'' During a visit to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in July, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a three-year, $ 149 million aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to encourage fledgling economic and political reforms. Since then, under pressure from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, he has raised the value of his aid proposal to about $ 450 million. Last week, the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ with strong backing from Republicans _ approved a three-year, $ 837 million aid package for the two countries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has been stung by the rhetoric of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, who have denounced the president's policy as `` timid.'' In the Times interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Democrats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have been calling me ` timid.' I have other, better words, like ` cautious,' ` diplomatic,' ` prudent.'''

<HEAD>Auditors Raise New Safety Issue at Savannah River Arms Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Energy Department may have to spend more than $ 8 million to correct a newly disclosed problem at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant, according to federal auditors who say the flaw raises new safety concerns. In a report Tuesday to a House Government Operations subcommittee, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> revealed that tubes containing materials used in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s nuclear reactors were either made to incorrect specifications or their specifications could not be determined because of `` paperwork problems.'' Use of badly flawed tubes could, in the worst case, lead to an uncontrolled chain reaction in the reactors that produce a gas used in nuclear warheads, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. When the problem was discovered in September 1988 by E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> operator, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> to stop making the tubes and stop putting them in the reactors until the cause of the problem and its significance could be pinpointed. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` several months'' later it was determined that the tube flaws were n't serious enough to pose a safety problem, but that none of them will be used in the reactors, which have been shut down since April 1988 for repairs and safety upgrades It said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated it would cost $ 731,000 to replace the 174 flawed tubes and an additional 101 tubes affected by the problem. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Fultz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s director of energy issues, told the subcommittee the cost could go beyond $ 8 million, depending on how the department chooses to handle the corrections. The report said that while the department has taken steps aimed at preventing a recurrence, the incident raises further questions about the department's ability to improve management at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which is situated near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` This is another in a series of incidents at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Site pointing out poor internal controls and management inattention to safety,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said. The report said the specifications of some of the questionable tubes could not be determined because <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s records were out-of-date and gave conflicting accounts of how much enriched uranium and lithium were in the tubes. Department officials at the hearing provided no additional information about the problem, and <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> officials could not be reached for comment afterward. At the same hearing, the department acknowledged it may have erred in rewarding <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and the operators of some of its other nuclear weapons plants with millions of dollars in bonuses despite serious failings in safety and health protection. `` There is room for real question'' about whether the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should have paid $ 912,000 in bonuses last year to the top 25 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> managers at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said in sworn testimony. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> acknowledged that the three highest-paid <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> executives, with collective government salaries of $ 561,000 and bonuses of $ 306,000 in 1988, were not based at the plant site. They worked at <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. From 1984 through 1988, the top 25 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> executives in charge of running <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> got $ 12.7 million in salaries plus $ 3.5 million in bonuses from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the figures showed. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> took over as operator April 1. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told the committee the top <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> executives are paid less than were the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> managers, and all top <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> managers are at the plant. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> did not provide exact figures for <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> salaries or bonuses.

<HEAD>A Spat Between Two Former Officials: In This Corner...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One side effect of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inability to dislodge <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a highly unusual public spat between two influential former officials over who is to blame for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> policy failure. The finger-pointing, mudslinging and mutual recriminations carried out recently in prominent newspapers are a departure from the normal practice of policymakers who disagree. Such disputes usually are kept private, but the feelings on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation run deeply. In one corner in this conflict is the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's top diplomat for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, and in the other is the recently retired chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON> They have decided to take the gloves off. The hawkish <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, 41, quit government service in January. The more dovish <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, 64, joined the military six years before <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was born. Both have impressive educational backgrounds and relish intellectual combat. But beyond that, the similarities between them are few. Aside from their political differences, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> is a relative bantam while <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> is a 6-foot-tall, 200-pounder. Their dispute over <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> boils down to how far the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have gone last year in its efforts to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a question that has been revived following the failed coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> three weeks ago. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> fired the first salvo against <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> two days after the abortive coup attempt, complaining in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> column that <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and the joint chiefs used `` adamant pressure'' to reject proposals for `` vigorous action'' against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last year. These and other allegations prompted <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> to rebut in a letter to the Times that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was both `` naive and reckless'' in his advocacy of the use of military force in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> suggested that such attitudes are not uncommon among `` young political appointees who have never served in uniform.'' In a telephone interview this week, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>'s suggestion that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was alone in the push for a more pugnacious stand against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` They were not my positions, they were the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s,'' he said. As for the notion that reckless military action is often the option favored by those who have never seen active duty, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> replied that a military move in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was urged by his boss, a well-known Marine combat veteran, former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> did not return a reporter's phone call this week but said in his letter to the Times that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was wrong from the start about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> wrote, offered assurances that the mere threat of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` He then argued with great confidence that actually imposing sanctions would bring the general to his knees in two weeks. We tried that and it did n't work either,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> denied that he suggested that economic sanctions would ever be sufficient to bring down <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He also suggested that <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> attempted to influence public opinion with newspaper leaks designed to discredit the options <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was advocating on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In a country that adheres to the principle of civilian supremacy, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, such activity by a uniformed officer is `` pernicious.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, meanwhile, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> this week that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> had been `` bad-mouthing me all over town, saying, ` Is n't it sort of weird that the J.C.S. are wimps,' and things like that. `` I was getting a little bit tired of <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>. Now that I'm free to talk, I felt I should throw down the gauntlet,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said.

 Environmentalists are giving <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> high marks for refusing to allow a lumber company to haul timber from national forests through <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` I think the park service is to be commended,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` It did the right thing.'' <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> rejected a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> argument that an economic emergency justified the route. `` It would have set a very serious precedent,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said, contending that private owners would have made similar requests if the forest service had prevailed. <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> denied the request on the advice of lawyers who said it violated federal regulations that prohibit commercial transport across park roadways, said park service spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON>, <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> said, was concerned that the plan to move about 20,000 truckloads of logs through the park would have adverse impact on important grizzly bear, elk and bison habitats as well as roadways. The forest service sold the timber from national forests bordering <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> that were partially burned during colossal fires that swept through the park last year. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Brand-S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, which bought the wood, said the longer the partially burned wood remained in the forest, the less value it would have. `` In a couple of years, no one will buy it,'' he said. However, park service lawyers said the need to sell the logs quickly did n't constitute an emergency, <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> made his decision Monday after meeting Friday with <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, national parks lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> and the associate director for park operations, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>, <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> said. `` The forest service was not leaning on us,'' <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> said, adding that there is an alternative route the lumber company may use.

<TEXT>
 The board of trustees for the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts is moving to possibly reduce the powers of its chairman and chief executive, sources say. The sources said Tuesday night the 45-member board, in a meeting scheduled for today, may consider changes in the center's bylaws to ease <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> out of some of his responsibilities as the day-to-day administrator of the cultural center. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> is reported to have been the source of friction between some trustees in recent months. The sources noted that the bylaws provide for a president, a position vacant since the center opened in 1971 as the nation's only official memorial to President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that 28 trustees said they do n't want to renew <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s contract, which expires in January 1991. Some told <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> they wanted to negotiate an earlier end to his tenure, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> executive, was hired in February 1988 to succeed Broadway producer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the first chairman. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> officially retired in August of this year after a long transition. Reports of <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s difficulties surfaced after the board's last meeting three months ago One Kennedy Center source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> had come to believe differences over the future of the center were intractable. The source did n't detail the differences. The newspaper said differences concerned personality clashes and other matters, not the artistic health of the center. Among the matters cited were <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s reported failure to attend important parties, how to pay for an upcoming trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> being unreachable by British producer <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, most likely losing the chance to mount <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>'s productions of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> II'' and `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, general counsel to the center, declined to comment on the report. The newspaper said <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> declined to comment. The white marble building on the north bank of the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> houses six theaters and concert stages and provides much of the cultural activity of the nation's capital. The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appoints 30 of the 45 trustees for 10-year terms; 15 members serve ex-officio, representing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, government agencies and advisory bodies.

<HEAD>Drug `Ice' Could Be Bigger Problem Than Cocaine, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A smokeable drug called `` ice'' is a major problem in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and could become a greater threat than cocaine, officials say. `` The ice problem is so bad that crack pales by comparison,'' <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibb </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday. `` Ice is cheaper to produce, gives users a very long, steady high, and is more addictive than heroin.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bent </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, `` I think we have an epidemic.'' The hearing focused on the Asian-produced crystalline form of methamphetamine that has hit <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and some cities on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and on the re-emergence of powdered methamphetamine, known as `` crank,'' `` speed'' and `` meth.'' Although ice is more expensive than cocaine, selling for as much as $ 7,000 for a full ounce, drug users consider it more economical because it lasts longer, <PERSON> Bent </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> Gibb </PERSON> said the high lasts four to 14 hours. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgreen </PERSON> said regular methamphetamine _ which can be smoked and provides the same high as ice, according to experts _ can be produced for about $ 1,000 a pound and sold in bulk for $ 5,000 a pound. On the street, <PERSON> Burgreen </PERSON> said, one-eighth of an ounce can sell for as much as $ 200. He said the process to transform regular methamphetamine into the popular and more expensive ice `` is relatively simple.'' `` Ice is odorless and can be smoked in public with little danger of detection,'' <PERSON> Gibb </PERSON> said. `` This factor, as well as the long-lasting high and the ready availability of the drug, have made it the drug of choice for on-the-job use in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>.'' The increase in the drug's popularity is evident not only in the increase in arrests _ the caseload is up 75 percent over last year and there are two ice cases for every cocaine case _ but also in hospital admissions, he said. `` Last year, one of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>'s major hospitals averaged one ice overdose a day; this year there have been half a dozen a day,'' <PERSON> Gibb </PERSON> said. Since 1985, he said, 32 deaths in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> have been attributed to ice, while in the first six months of 1989 there were eight homicides and seven suicides connected to the drug.

<HEAD>Government: Extradition of Drug Traffickers to Continue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A car bomb exploded in the resort city of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> just hours after the government pledged to resist a terror campaign and keep extraditing suspected drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The bomb went off late Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Bocagrande </LOCATION> section of the city near the Barlovento hotel, injuring two people and causing extensive damage, the radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> reported. The hotel is popular with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourists. Sixteen people have been killed and 201 injured in bombings blamed on drug gangs since mid-August, when the government launched its anti-drug campaign and cocaine barons reciprocated with a declaration of war. The State Council, a panel of top government leaders, said Tuesday that an emergency decree issued Aug. 19 by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> allowing extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to be applied. The council also said it has no intention of entering negotiations with traffickers, as some have proposed. Barco issued the extradition decree after assassins shot to death a leading presidential candidate. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s previous extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been struck down in the courts. Also Tuesday, the bodyguard of a manager for the anti-drug crusading newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> was fatally shot in western <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Police said the victim, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Osorio </PERSON>, was a member of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police force. <PERSON> Osorio </PERSON> was walking to meet a friend for lunch when two men approached him on a motorcycle and opened fire, a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police spokesman said by telephone. After killing the bodyguard, police said, the assassins chased down and murdered his friend, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, five blocks away. The spokesman said the murders resulted from a personal dispute.

In rejecting negotiations with the drug cartels the council said: `` The government has undertaken a policy of combating drug trafficking and its criminal organizations, and nowhere in this campaign is there room for either a dialogue or negotiations with traffickers. A message from drug traffickers published by the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday had asked for talks with the government to end extraditions if the cocaine bosses agree to abandon all drug trafficking in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Under <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s decree, the government has extradited four people to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although government forces have seized millions of dollars in alleged assets of drug traffickers since mid-August, they have yet to capture any of the top cocaine bosses wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<NOTE>Report Says 11 Percent of Young People's Deaths Caused by Guns</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government report showing guns cause 11 percent of young people's deaths underscores the need to lower teen-age homicide rates, especially among blacks, Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> says. Since 1968, homicide has been the leading cause of death for black males age 15 to 19. From 1984 to 1987, the rate for that group jumped 53 percent _ to 60 deaths per 100,000, according to a report released Tuesday. Firearms are responsible for about eight in 10 of these deaths, the report said. The report, `` Firearm Mortality Among Children and Youth,'' was released in conjunction with the premiere of a television documentary on youth homicide, produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The program is being offered to stations nationwide. `` Just as we have controlled so many childhood diseases, we must now mount an equally aggressive campaign to rid our children's lives of the causes and tools of injury and violence,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in a statement The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> counted 3,392 firearm-related deaths among children age 1 to 19 in 1987 _ about 11 percent of all childhood deaths.

<HEAD>Illegal Landfill Collapses, Buries Shantytown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An illegal man-made hill collapsed and buried a shantytown under tons of mud, killing at least three people and injuring dozens, rescue officials said. Many more were feared dead. `` A wall of earth blanketed the area,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenorio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Albuquerque </PERSON>, a fire official. `` We've rescued a few people, but there are countless others under the mud.'' The disaster occurred Tuesday in the Nova Republica slum in southern <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> when the 100-foot-high hill of dirt excavated from construction sites, located illegally near the slum, gave way and smothered 56 wood and brick shacks, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Albuquerque </PERSON> said. Officials said they did not know exactly how many people were buried in the mudslide. But survivors at the scene said about 400 people lived in the slum neighborhood. <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said some houses were buried under at least 45 feet of dirt. `` We heard a loud roar and the ground shook and we ran for the door,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Prazeres </PERSON>, a survivor, said in a television interview. `` We just had time to move before the walls came crashing down on us.'' Firemen and civil rescue crews arrived shortly after the disaster and began pulling out victims, de <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> said. The helmeted workers, aided by residents, dug through layers of reddish mud with axes, shovels, hoes and their bare hands. `` My house was destroyed and I have n't anywhere to go, but thank God my family and I are still alive,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Onofre </PERSON>, 49, a mechanic who was returning home from a laundromat when the hill collapsed. The injured were treated at a makeshift emergency medical tent. Survivors were sheltered temporarily in nearby schools and churches, de <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> said. The dirt, about 400,000 cubic yards of it, was illegally dumped near the shantytowns, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said, adding that the developer responsible had been fined several times. `` It will take at least one week before the full extent of the tragedy is known,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Albuquerque </PERSON> said darkness and the remote location made rescue operations slow and difficult.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s daily meetings with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Iran-Contra may entitle the former national security adviser to subpoena some of the ex-president's notes and diaries, a federal judge says. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> on Tuesday gave <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> the go-ahead to seek `` relevant'' documents from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He set Jan. 22 for <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s trial on charges of conspiracy, making false statements and obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> will assert in his defense that his activities were authorized by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, contentions that suggest that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was far more deeply involved in details of the Iran-Contra scandal than he has acknowledged. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> rejected a request by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> for permission to subpoena notes of then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> failed to show that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might have authorized his activities. But the judge held open the possibility that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> might be allowed to seek documents from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later if he can show `` a more pressing need.'' `` If the claims'' by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` are correct ... there is a ` sufficient likelihood' that the documents sought from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be material to the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> defense,'' the judge said. `` If the defendant submits ... subpoenas ... for specific, relevant documents in the custody of former President Reagan'' or the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>, `` the court will authorize their issuance,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have to produce any subpoenaed documents by Nov. 23, but such a subpoena could invoke a claim of executive privilege. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, a lawyer for the former president, declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> quashed subpoenas for testimony from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide who worked under <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said, contends that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with him `` daily, frequently alone'' and that they `` routinely'' discussed such matters as `` the role of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> as a middleman in the transfer of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> maintains in sealed papers that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was briefed about a false chronology of the administration's arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> involving four of the criminal charges against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The chronology stated that no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew before January 1986 that a November 1985 shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> contained Hawk missiles. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> assisted the shipment without a signed presidential finding as required by law. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> asserts that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on the inaccurate chronology and other matters, either `` formulated the administration's position'' or `` entertained <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s plans without voicing any objection.'' `` It appears that notes were taken by the president and others on these conversations and, according to the defendant, these notes or presidential diary entries ... would support his defense to the charges,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> contends that he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> discussed `` the administration's view'' of a contemplated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee inquiry into the then-secret Contra resupply program operated by North. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is charged with obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by encouraging <PERSON> North </PERSON> to lie in an Aug. 6, 1986, meeting with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about assisting the Contras. After the meeting, in which <PERSON> North </PERSON> denied aiding the rebels, the proposed resolution of inquiry was shelved. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> sent a `` well done'' message to North after the Aug. 6 meeting. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> maintains he discussed frequently with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` the depth of the administration's commitment to the Contras and its desire to continue to provide military support to them.''

 A swarm of 40 earthquakes struck the Yellowstone National Park area, but only two were strong enough to be felt, geologists said. The quakes began at 1:16 p.m. MDT Tuesday and were recorded during the next nine hours, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who monitors <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> seismic activity for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismograph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>. The quakes included two of magnitude 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground movement, at 9:35 p.m. and 9:36 p.m. These were large enough to be felt locally, he said. The quakes were six miles north of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, along the western boundary of the park. They struck within five miles of an extensive swarm sequence in 1985, which included 28 quakes of magnitude 3.5 or greater, <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> said. He said Tuesday's quakes were at the eastern end of the rupture zone of the magnitude 7.5 Hebgen quake on Aug. 17, 1959. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area; a 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. The Oct. 17 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area quake measured 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

<TEXT>
 The Joffrey Ballet season at the City Center opened with what was intended to be a salute to vaudeville. But the $ 650,000, 40-minute entertainment is n't ballet, and it is n't a thoroughgoing giggle to watch, either. `` The Pantages and the Palace Present Two-a-Day'' was seen Tuesday night at the start of a season that runs through Nov. 19. After <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s `` Arden Court,'' in which dancers looked bright and sparkling, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Arpino </PERSON>'s duet `` Sea Shadow'' and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> premiere of `` Two-a-Day,'' a `` Roaring'20s'' supper ball was held at <LOCATION> Roseland </LOCATION>. This was appropriate since some of `` Two-a-Day'' looked more like a glitzy production of `` The Boy Friend'' _ the 1954 musical about the'20s _ than like vaudeville. <PERSON> Arpino </PERSON> was inspired to create `` Two-a-Day'' by theaters which alternated movies and live stage shows. He began with a color film recreating the ending of the first `` A Star Is Born.'' Then, presumably, the audience saw the dance part of the live show. The program explained who inspired each of eight scenes. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> is named for the first, `` Les Plumes.'' With 15 women running around waving big pink and white fans, it looked more as though <LOCATION> Busby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> was its inspiration. There is n't much dancing in `` Two-a-Day,'' but there are a lot of men carrying women aloft and a lot of just running around the stage. Six men with top hats and canes were listed as tapdancing. They did a few novelty steps and one expertly twirled his cane like a baton. In more extreme novelty, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginden </PERSON> wafted about two long pieces of silk with her arms and poles she held in her hands. Bathing beauties in middy tops and shorts formed a kick line. A Persian couple seemed like a chance for a dance, but mostly <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossbrucker </PERSON> carried <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Janus </PERSON> over his head. Six couples spoofing Spanish dancing was close to camp; it was the liveliest scene and probably the best. A girl with bobbed hair arrived from above, seated on a moon, amid swooning men and was carried around by them before departing skyward. The mild finale was meant to be a group <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Most of the music was composed by <PERSON> Rebekah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkness </PERSON>. `` Two-a-Day'' was commissioned by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> to honor the office of the president. It was underwritten by <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Harkness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for Dance. The premiere was Oct. 10 at <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. We would n't really want to see `` Two-a-Day'' again. Maybe there should have been a couple of comics and a trained dog.

 Kidnappers holding at least two Americans have again issued their demand for the release of 15 Shiite Moslem comrades jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies. A statement from Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, was delivered Tuesday to the independent newspaper An-Nahar and a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The agency's copy was accompanied by an instant photograph of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who has been held the longest of the 18 Western hostages. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, abducted March 16, 1985, is chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We renew our firm emphasis on the need to free our struggling brethren from the jails of the collaborating <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> regime, and declare that the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- shall not rest until they see their brethren free,'' said the statement, typewritten in Arabic. The photograph of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was similar to one released by Islamic Jihad on Nov. 4, 1988, with the last statement from the group, showing <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> about to cut a birthday cake. No cake was visible in the latest picture, a close-up from a slightly different angle that shows <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> from the waist up, mustachioed and smiling, wearing glasses and a yellow T-shirt. In the background is what appears to be the same blue curtain. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> turns 42 on Friday. It will be his fifth birthday in captivity. Islamic Jihad also holds <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, who was acting dean of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was abducted June 9, 1985. The Shiite Moslems in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> were convicted on terrorist charges stemming from the 1983 embassy bombings, in which at least five people were killed and 86 wounded. Three have been condemned to death, but the sentences have not been carried out. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has refused previous demands to release the prisoners. With the statement delivered to An-Nahar were two pictures of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> base and the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> paratroop headquarters in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that were attacked with truck bombs Oct. 23, 1983. Islamic Jihad said it issued the statement to mark the anniversary of the bombings, which killed 241 American military personnel and 58 French soldiers. Like most other Lebanese factions claiming to hold Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> is believed to be a group of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> offered Monday to help secure the hostages' release if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> releases frozen Iranian assets or helps determine the fate of three Iranians, now believed dead, kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a strong abortion control bill that advances <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> toward becoming the first state to take advantage of new restrictions allowed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delayed discussion of the bill until after it returns from a two-week break for elections. The state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, has said he supports new controls on abortion. `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> sent to the nation this message,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, a Republican and sponsor of the anti-abortion proposal. `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> always will be down the road pro-life.'' In <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was to begin debate today on a bill requiring parental consent for abortion until a woman is 18 years old. After nine hours of debate Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 143-58 in favor of a bill that would ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy in most cases. It also would require a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion; require women to tell their husbands in most cases if they plan abortions; prohibit sex-selection abortion; and restrict, but not ban, the use of tissue from aborted fetuses in scientific research. Anti-abortion lawmakers defeated several attempts to weaken the bill, which Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s pro-choice leader, called `` cruel and mean-spirited. `` This is a very sad day in this House and for the women of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> called passage of the measure `` an unconscionable tragedy. `` The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> has done the women of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> an unforgiveable and unforgettable injustice,'' said Sue Frietsche of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. Anti-abortion leaders were jubilant. `` It was a good vote in behalf of the women in this state and for unborn children,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliveau </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Pro-life Federation. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Legislature repeatedly had voted for abortion controls since the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. Anti-abortion efforts were renewed after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July ruling that restored key sections of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law restricting the use of public money and facilities in performing abortions. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, called into special session by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> earlier this month, rejected all of his proposed abortion restrictions. Last week, a committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> blocked a bill to restrict abortions.

<TEXT>
 One of four people freed from prison last week after a court ruled they were wrongly convicted of a 1974 Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombing says police harassed him at gunpoint in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> after his release. Legislators <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbyn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said today they will question Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>'s A unidentified spokesman for the <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> family was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, 35, was badly shaken after police in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> stopped a taxi in which he and family members were traveling Tuesday. Police checked the identity papers of the people in the taxi, the report said, then searched <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Roman Catholic, at gunpoint. `` Guns were pointed at him and one ... officer turned and shouted to a group of others, ` This is <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>,''' the report said. The Royal <PERSON> Ulster </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> police force, said in a statement that if <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> made an official complaint, it would be investigated. <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> earlier told reporters: `` After 15 years -LRB- in prison -RRB-, have n't they done enough to me and my family?'' Searches by armed police are commonplace in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> but critics allege they are sometimes carried out to harass members of the minority Catholic community. <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> after Thursday's ruling in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, the country's second-ranking judge, that he and the other three members of the so-called <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four were wrongly convicted. The four _ <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> _ were serving life sentences for an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombing at a tavern at <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Oct. 5, 1974, that killed five people. They were arrested shortly after the bombing and tried and convicted in 1975. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> quashed the convictions after a prolonged campaign, ruling that police officers probably lied to get the four convictions. He also reversed the convictions of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> for an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing at a tavern in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Woolwich </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 6, 1974. Two people died in that blast. The government has ordered an inquiry into alleged police misconduct. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the mainly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON> moonlights as an earthquake prophet, using theories based on lost pets and lunar tides, but it may have cost him his job as geologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON> complained Tuesday that he got a `` bad rap'' after he predicted the deadly 7.1-magnitude quake that killed dozens, injured thousands and caused more than $ 7.1 billion in damage. <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON>'s boss, Planning Director <PERSON> Leode </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, said she put him on administrative leave because his reported claims of another major quake in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area in November were `` generating unwarranted fear.'' <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON>, 59, contends he predicted nothing more than a 3.5 - to 5.5-magnitude quake between Nov. 11 and Nov. 18 `` This is a fantastic situation when I get accused of something I did n't do,'' <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> area home. The geologist said he has been predicting temblors for 15 years by studying tides, the movement of the sun and the moon and the disoriented behavior of dogs, cats, birds and other animals immediately before an earthquake. He said one clue is the large number of lost animal advertisements printed in papers a week or two before an earthquake. <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON> theorizes that animals are far more sensitive than people to changes in magnetic fields known to occur before quakes, and when they get disoriented they lose their sense of direction. <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON> said his unorthodox methods have generated ridicule over the years. He got wide attention after the Oct. 17 quake because he'd said four days earlier that a quake measuring up to 6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was about to hit. Ms. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON> was hired by the county to assess geologic conditions for land use approvals in unincorporated areas. `` My real concern is the public as a whole sees him as a county official,'' she said, adding that his hobby has interfered with legitimate geologic assessments. If <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> wants information on potential quakes, Ms. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said it will rely on the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geologic Survey. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> said there was a 50-50 chance of a major aftershock by Christmas. The <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> based its prediction on statistical data from other quakes in the area and on geologists' observations of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> fault. The agency has disputed <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON>'s methods. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakun </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> said people `` can do just as well by flipping a coin and be as successful as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON>'' in forecasting temblors. <PERSON> Berkland </PERSON> claimed that he's been right on 240 of the 300 quakes he has predicted during the past 15 years.

<HEAD>Amnesty: Governments Killed Tens of Thousands Illegally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government agents in at least two dozen countries illegally killed tens of thousands of people in 1988 and more than half the world's governments tortured or mistreated prisoners, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today. The London-based human rights group said in its annual global survey that human rights were violated in 133 countries last year. The violations ranged from death squad killings in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to harassment of church groups in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and mistreatment of jailed Aborigines in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The 310-page report said the victims of deliberate, illegal killings in at least two dozen countries were government opponents, members of ethnic or religious groups and civilians living in areas of military operations. It said the victims were gunned down in groups or shot by snipers, blown up by explosives, stabbed, strangled, hacked to death or poisoned. Many were tortured to death. One-third of the world's governments jailed prisoners of conscience _ defined by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> as people locked up for the non-violent exercise of their human rights, the group said. And it accused more than half the governments of either torturing or mistreating prisoners. Also, 1,903 prisoners were executed under death penalty laws in 35 countries in 1988, the highest number of such executions since 1981, the report said. Amnesty, winner of the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize, opposes capital punishment in all circumstances. The report was written before many of the sweeping democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. An accompanying summary touched only briefly on the June killing of hundreds of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by Chinese troops as the government moved to crush the student-led pro-democracy movement. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, victims of illegal killings were often severely mutilated before being killed, the report said. It called those killings, and the killing of hundreds of civilians by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s security forces, `` striking examples of continuing extrajudicial executions this year.'' It said governments made `` enormous efforts'' to conceal evidence of such killings, but details were reaching the international community more rapidly than ever before. `` Killings are carried out at night, when the victims are alone, or in remote rural areas where even large-scale troop movements can be undertaken unobserved,'' the report said. `` In urban areas, specialized squads are trained to function in secrecy and are authorized to conduct operations in areas under curfew and police control.'' Amnesty said many such killings occurred during armed conflict in countries including <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` Warfare makes it easier to evade accountability; not only is access by independent observers limited but the dead can be characterized as combatants ... or as the unavoidable civilian casualties of war,'' the report said. Amnesty said many people became victims simply because they lived in areas where the overall population was seen as the enemy. It said Iraqi forces attacked the Kurdish population with chemical weapons, deliberately killing some 5,000 men, women and children in <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>. Survivors of chemical attacks were often summarily executed, and in villages near the town of <LOCATION> Duhok </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 executions in one day were reported, it said. Many killings occurred during or after anti-government demonstrations, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. It expressed concern about the Israeli-occupied territories where more than 300 Palestinian civilians were killed in 1988; <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> where at least 176 demonstrators died; and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, where Chinese police killed dozens of pro-independence demonstrators. Amnesty said it documented prisoners of conscience in at least 76 countries in 1988. Among the worst offenders cited were <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, where thousands were detained for political reasons, including hundreds of prisoners of conscience, and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, where conscientious objectors to military service were in prison. However, 1,566 prisoners of conscience were released worldwide during 1988, or one in every three cases taken up by Amnesty. More than half the 300 known prisoners of conscience in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in January 1988 were released by the end of the year. Detainees were held without charge or trial in more than 75 countries, and torture and ill-treatment was reported in 94, it said.

 The disorganized coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was muddled by confusion and mixed feelings among officers about the leader they sought to overthrow, said the highest-ranking survivor of the attempt. Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> escaped the killings and arrests that followed the collapse of the Oct. 3 coup because he had been sent to <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> during the operation to ask why <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops had n't cut off roads or buzzed airports to block loyalists of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> When the coup began to crumble, <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> remained at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and eventually was flown with other refugees to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Licona </PERSON>, 36, talked to reporters Tuesday for the first time since the failed coup. He had declined to speak publicly while he arranged for relatives to join him and was interviewed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said the coup's leader, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, told him <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support was promised at a secret meeting the night of Oct. 1. `` But when I arrived -LRB- at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> -RRB- General <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> knew nothing of the support they were supposed to give us,'' <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> is the top <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. After a 20-minute phone call with someone, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> gave the order to block the roads, <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said. `` Panamanian military planes had already left to transport in the troops to support General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. It was too late,'' <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said. Having seized <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> during the coup attempt, <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> seemed unsure about what to do with him, <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said. `` He remained under <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s influence ... He had been very loyal to the general,'' <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> wanted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave power peacefully, but said he could remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> failed to make a clear agreement with Maj. <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Oleochea </PERSON>, leader of the strongest unit in the capital, Battalion 2000. `` He told me he was sure Major <PERSON> Oleochea </PERSON> would support us the moment he asked. But he never spoke wwith him concretely about what he wanted. I never trusted Oleochea,'' he said. <PERSON> Oleochea </PERSON> eventually joined <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in crushing the coup, <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> was slain.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> did n't want its members to work on Sunday so it left its pumpkin stand unstaffed that day.

Both had just attended <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Margaret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.

It just kind of happened. People were there to buy pumpkins.'' After collecting $ 57 in a half-hour, the Martinses went home and called the church. They learned it had no plans to staff the stand that day, so they returned with a lawn chair and a church staffer's blessing to set up business In three hours, mother and son took in $ 141, selling pumpkins from $ 4 to $ 12 apiece. The Rev. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralls </PERSON>, senior pastor at the Methodist church, said the money would help finance missionary projects sponsored by the church choir. `` I think she was a good Samaritan,'' he said.

 A wildlife handler is offering abandoned cats free to anyone who will prove a good home for them. Problem is, these felines grow to 150 pounds. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> has accumulated eight cougars at his Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation complex and he's having trouble giving them away. `` I have a very hard time placing cougars _ everybody does,'' he said. He wound up with the big cats as part of his job trapping and housing unwanted exotic animals. `` They make good pets if you understand what you're dealing with,'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` ... They have the potential to severely hurt somebody, and, in the case of a small child, kill them.'' Pet shops sold exotic cats until a couple years ago when stricter state laws were enacted. `` Anybody could walk into a pet shop, lay down $ 1,000 and walk off with a cat,'' said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. Now, to get a permit to own an exotic cat, the state requires three years of animal handling experience and a cage that meets certain specifications. `` Some people say that living in a cage is n't necessarily the best life for a cougar,'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` But it's someplace to go. I'm trying to keep them from being destroyed. `` I believe there are people out there who will love them, even though they ca n't pet them.''

 Workers prepared Atlantis for a weekend piggyback ride on a jet to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after finding the shuttle sustained very little damage to its heat-shield tiles during its latest space flight. `` Everything's going smooth. We're on schedule to depart on Saturday morning,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Atlantis today sat inside a 100-foot-tall steel structure named the `` mate-demate device'' as workers prepared to mount it atop a modified <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jumbo jet for the return to Kennedy Space Center. Plans now call for the jet to carry the shuttle to <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> for an overnight stop. But there was a remote possibility the entire trip would be completed Saturday, said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>, Atlantis processing director. Atlantis landed at this <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> military base Monday following a five-day flight during which astronauts released the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft from the shuttle's cargo bay for a looping six-year voyage to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. Initial inspection showed only 25 nicks caused by debris that hit the tiles. Most can be repaired and only six tiles will need to be replaced, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, tile manager for the shuttle, said Tuesday. No tiles were lost, she said. Inspection of Atlantis' brakes showed they looked `` really good,'' while the shuttle's tires displayed only `` normal scuffing,'' <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> said. The mission was Atlantis' fifth, and was the sixth flight for any shuttle since the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed its seven crew members. The next flight of Atlantis, scheduled for Feb. 10, probably will be delayed by up to six days because of the six-day delay in launching the shuttle on the just-completed flight, <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> said. Atlantis is scheduled to perform a classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission in February. Two other shuttle flights are planned for this year. Discovery is scheduled for a Nov. 20 launch on a classified Pentagon mission. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, scheduled for launch on a 10-day mission Dec. 20, will place a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite in orbit, then attempt to retrieve the $ 15 million Long Duration Exposure Facility satellite, which will fall into <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere in February unless it is plucked from its decaying orbit. The satellite contains experiments related to the proposed `` Star Wars'' system to defend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against incoming warheads. The experiments were meant to determine how materials that might be used in a Star Wars system will fare in the hostile environment of space. The satellite, launched by Challenger in 1984, also contains millions of tomato seeds, which will be planted on Earth to learn how weightlessness affects the subsequent growth of the seeds.

<HEAD>Methane Levels High in Mine, Inspector Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Four of the 10 men killed in an explosion at a western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mine were pulled from an area where dangerous methane levels had been detected four days earlier, a state official said. But the official, testifying Tuesday at a hearing on the Sept. 13 explosion, said the high concentration of the gas alone would not account for the blast, which caused the worst <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine disaster since 1984. Interviews with workers at the William Station Mine indicated that tests showed the air in one part of the mine was 6 percent methane on Sept. 9, said the official, state mining inspector <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Methane is considered explosive at levels of 5 percent to 15 percent. Workers hung additional fireproof curtains and tightened existing curtains to allow more air to flow into the mine and decrease the high methane level. They also assigned a person to monitor the methane level while they worked in the area, he said. `` From what I can find out, they warned oncoming crews they had detected methane,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. State investigators are considering several possible causes for the accumulation of methane, including water that blocked the mine's primary ventilation system and the absence of a regulator, or curtain, to control the flow of air through the mine. Workers were not required to use the regulator, since mining in the section had been completed on Sept. 6, and the four workers who died in the area of high methane concentration were dismantling a longwall mining machine, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The six other miners were working in another section. The explosion may have been sparked by torches believed to have been in use before the explosion, or by rock falls that may have caused electric cables to spark, officials said. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Siler </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said officials did not learn of the high methane level until after the explosion. Attorneys for widows of miners killed in the blast questioned state and company officials knew about a partition that was removed about 15 minutes before the explosion. Federal investigators have said tearing down the barrier may have altered the air flow in the mine, allowing the explosive methane gas to accumulate. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> testified, however, that the partition was about 5,400 feet away from the explosion area and was unlikely to have affected the level of methane in the blast area. Methane gas is given off as coal is mined. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said any accumulation of the gas usually clears out of an area within two days after mining ceases.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today that a Puerto Rican nationalist in lengthy pre-trial detention and a former <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Panther </PERSON> sentenced to life on a murder conviction may have been shortchanged by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justice system. In its annual global survey, the human rights organization reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and said the 11 prisoners executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year raised the total since 1977 to 104. The death row population grew to an unprecedented 2,182 prisoners in 34 states by the end of 1988, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> raised concerns about <PERSON> Filberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, a Puerto Rican independence supporter held in pre-trial detention in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> for 32 months on armed robbery charges. A federal court ordered his release on bail in May 1988, saying `` due process can not tolerate any further pre-trial detention.'' However, he was arrested again three months later and charged with a new offense of assault relating to his original arrest in 1985. <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> was denied bail and again placed in detention. Amnesty said he was held `` in virtual incommunicado detention'' with only limited access to lawyers. It expressed concern that <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>' lengthy pre-trial detention may have undermined his right to be tried within a reasonable period or else be released. The human rights group also said it asked Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to order an inquiry into the case of a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a 1972 murder conviction. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> `` Geronimo'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> may have been denied a fair trial because of his political activities, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. It said new evidence obtained after <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s trial indicated he was targeted for `` neutralization'' by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> between 1968 and 1971 because of his political activities. It said the evidence also revealed the chief prosecution witness was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant and that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> planted informers in <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s defense teams A 1985 court hearing dismissed <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s motion for a new trial, ruling that the chief prosecution witness had been an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> contact, not an informer, and that <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> had not suffered as a result of the surveillance on his defense team. In June 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Ninth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> also turned down his appeal on technical grounds. Amnesty said <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> told them he was without the `` authority, ability and resources'' to order an inquiry. On other matters, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said it investigated reports that prisoners in several state prisons had been ill-treated, including the <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> where guards allegedly beat prisoners who were handcuffed and kept in leg irons. The warden of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Unit </PERSON> informed Amnesty that no such incidents had occurred, the report said. Amnesty said it also looked into reports that prisoners in the Administrative Control Unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> were shackled and chained to cell fixtures. Others were alleged to have been sprayed with mace and high-pressure water and left in empty, unheated cells for several days. Prison authorities denied that prisoners had been ill-treated but admitted that shackles, chains and mace were used for restraining purposes, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said. The international human rights organization said it also concluded that conditions in the High Security Unit of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Federal Prison were substandard The unit has since been closed.

 A man accused of discrimination for denying housing to an unmarried couple will grudgingly pay a $ 700 fine with $ 1 contributions from supporters while he waits for a ruling on his appeal, his lawyer said. The donations for Layle French came from around the country, said the attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. French, 33, was fined $ 1,048 on June 7 by an administrative law judge who said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> violated the state's anti-discrimination law when he reneged on an agreement to rent his former house to <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> planned to live in the house with her fiance.

 The 82-year-old lawyer who represented <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> through much of his fraud and conspiracy trial does n't expect to be paid soon by the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder, but relishes the publicity `` Every case I've ever had has been a heart-stopper,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has been practicing law for more than five decades. `` Those are the only kinds of cases I take.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> gained reknown representing legendary labor leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> and since has represented accused Nazi war criminals, political prisoners, death row inmates and deposed foreign leaders.

<HEAD>State Radio Says Soviets Could Help Persuade ANC To Negotiate</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAVID CRARY</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Soviet Union could play an important role in helping to initiate talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white government and its black adversaries, state radio said today The South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in a commentary, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was the only major power with influence over the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has said it will neither halt its use of violence nor enter negotiations until the government legalizes it, frees all political prisoners, ends the 40-month-old state of emergency and lifts restrictions on opposition activity. The government says the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is welcome to enter negotiations if it commits itself to peaceful solutions. `` While it must be stressed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ... will remain the main supplier of weapons to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> as long as it decides to continue its program of violence, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is nevertheless now publicly urging the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to take part in a political, or negotiated, settlement,'' the radio commentary said. `` There is a clear need for all sides to concentrate less on preconditions and to get down to initial talks about the negotiations that they must eventually take part in,'' the commentary said. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could play an important role as a facilitator in working with other parties to loosen the current logjam.'' President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has offered to negotiate a new constitution which would extend political rights to the black majority, although he envisions a system in which whites would retain veto power over major decisions. In a series of steps aimed at promoting talks, de Klerk has eased restrictions on mass protests, conferred with anti-apartheid activists and freed unconditionally eight long-term political prisoners, including seven <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders. The freed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> men have spoken forthrightly in support of their organization, including its use of violence, and they are to address a government-approved mass rally Sunday. Nevertheless, Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has denied the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has been tacitly legalized. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> will remain banned `` as long as it refuses to commit itself to peaceful development,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The South African Police will continue to stop the organization in its tracks.'' <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>, leader of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a speech Tuesday night that the government was obsessed with the concept of negotiation, at the expense of white sovereignty. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` insults our nationality and chases us up the path of black domination under the flag of consensus and reconciliation,'' said <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>, whose party won 31 percent of the white vote in parliamentary elections last month. `` We will rather make do with a smaller white area than with one under an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> government,'' he said.

 The law slapped back at <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> with a three-day jail term for slapping a policeman, ending a circuslike case that left the actress unrepentant and her husband fuming. `` Yes, I'm upset,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s eighth husband, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Anhalt </PERSON>, as he stormed down the steps of the courthouse after Tuesday's sentencing. `` I will ask the court if I can go to jail instead of my wife.'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, a one-time Hungarian beauty queen believed to be in her mid-60s to early 70s, snickered, smiled and made quips as <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Municipal Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> announced the sentence, peppering his statements with rebukes and warnings. `` Now you laugh,'' the judge said, before lecturing Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> about the 25,000 Americans who die yearly in alcohol-related accidents. Among Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s misdemeanor convictions was driving with an open container of alcohol. `` The law applies to everyone, whether they are rich or poor and whether they are famous or not,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said before sentencing her. `` In the absence of extremely mitigating circumstances ... if you strike a cop, you go to jail.'' Along with the jail term, the judge ordered Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> to pay $ 12,937.50 in fines and restitutions and to perform 120 hours of community service in a women's homeless shelter, where she may not talk about her case or give media interviews. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, who returned home after the verdict, was given until Dec. 29 to complete the jail sentence. She also was ordered to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and to refrain from driving until she gets her real age on her driver's license During the trial, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> claimed the license was stolen and altered by someone else. The judge repeatedly attacked Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s demeanor inside and outside of court, saying she was `` milking this case for publicity'' at the expense of the taxpayers who paid for the trial. `` She has demonstrated an attitude continually of contempt for law and order and these proceedings, without a hint of remorse or contrition of any kind,'' the judge said. `` And that is very relevant to sentencing.'' As Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> left the courtroom, she disputed the judge's contention that she not only slapped a police officer, but the American people by her statements out of court that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was worse than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` I'm a very good American. I love <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` Why should I slap the face of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, star of such B-films as `` Queen of Outer Space'' and `` Picture Mommy Dead,'' faced a maximum of 18 months in jail, and the judge warned that she could get more jail time if she violated her parole. The tempestuous celebrity slapped Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> on June 14 after he stopped her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> convertible. The actress testified she instinctively struck <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> after he roughed her up. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> overreacted, she said, and used undue force in arresting her. Besides the alcohol offense, a jury convicted Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> on Sept. 29 of battery on a police officer and driving without a valid driver's license. She was acquitted of failing to obey an officer. All the charges were misdemeanors. `` When she was first convicted, we felt that the police department and Officer <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> were vindicated,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, a police spokesman. `` We certainly feel that this -LRB- sentence -RRB- is even further vindication.'' The trial drew more than 100 reporters, camera crews and photographers from throughout the world. The sentencing attracted a <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> look-a-like </PERSON>, a man who wrote a poem for the trial, several people wearing `` Fry Zsa Zsa'' buttons, a man with `` John 3:16'' on a T-shirt and numerous tourists with pocket cameras. After the sentencing, a three-piece band played a drum roll as <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Anhalt </PERSON> walked down the court steps, then later played a song written for the trial, with lyrics that included: `` <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON>, she's going to jail She's paying some fines now.''

 Sunny, warm conditions lingered in much of the nation today. Indian summer prevailed across the central third of the country Tuesday as brisk southerly winds helped temperatures warm into the 70s and 80s across the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Readings of 80 degrees were reported as far north as southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Fifteen cities in the north-central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tied or broke the record highs for the date, including a high of 74 in International Falls, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, dubbed `` The Nation's Icebox'' because of its bitterly cold winters. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Voelker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, where the mercury climbed to a record 78, said goose hunters might be disappointed because the heat might prevent geese from flying low enough to hunt, adding: `` It seems a lot hotter than what it is. When you get used to 40-degree weather, it seems hotter.'' The warm weather spread to the East with highs mostly in the 60s and 70s, though temperatures remained in the 50s in parts of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> as well as southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Rain lingered in southwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with snow in the highest elevations. Half-inch hail was reported with a thunderstorm at Red Bluff, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Clouds and scattered showers prevailed behind a cold front crossing the northern Plains Clouds covered much of the nation west of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>.

Times Mirror, the Los Angeles-based media and information company, said earnings fell to $ 70.1 million, or 54 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 1 from $ 81 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Votes to Deny Communists Guaranteed Seats in Pa2liament</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other top Communists would have to campaign for their parliamentary seats in local districts in 1994, much as the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister does, if the legislature gets its way. The constitutional change throwing all seats in parliament up for popular election was approved by the Supreme Soviet Tuesday in a 254-to-85 vote. However, it must be confirmed by the legislature's parent body, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which meets at the end of the year. The change, part of a package of constitutional amendments approved Tuesday, denies the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other special interests their guaranteed seats. Last year's political reform allocated 100 seats to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which filled them by allowing the leadership to select just 100 candidates. That allowed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and most of the ruling Politburo to be seated in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> without facing a public vote of confidence. The Supreme Soviet, the 542-member full-time legislature, did not require <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to mount a national campaign to win re-election to the presidency, although some deputies had suggested a direct election. That post will continue to be filled by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from among its members. The decision by no means restricts the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from running candidates for geographical seats. Currently, 80 percent of the 2,250 deputies are <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. Last year's political reform gave Soviet voters their first real selection of candidates. But the election system was complex and many people complained that the process was undemocratic and favored the status quo. Two-thirds of the 2,250 deputies in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were elected from geographical districts. The other one-third were elected by social organizations, and the reform package promised 100 seats each to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the official trade unions and cooperative organizations. The package allocated 75 seats each to the Komsomol -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, to creative unions and to groups of women, academics and veterans. The last 75 were split among smaller groups, with one seat even going to an association of stamp collectors. Progressives complained that the system violated the principle of one person, one vote. They said members of these organizations had the opportunity to vote in each group as well as in their geographical district. In practice, key reform groups such as the Baltic people's fronts and groups of new private business cooperatives were shut out of the privileged group in favor of long-standing agricultural cooperatives and organizations controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> In one case, however, the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> capped a stormy series of elections by choosing a slate of reformers that included human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. The Supreme Soviet also decided Monday to allow the republics of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to make their own decisions on whether their presidents will be elected directly by the public or by their legislatures. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to handle final approval of constitutional amendments, the legislators speeded up their vote because a number of the republics are scheduled to adopt new election laws this week that depend on the national amendments, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said.

<TEXT>
 While applauding the Soviet admissions of past mistakes, some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials are concerned that the Kremlin may be engaged in a sophisticated campaign to weaken <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resolve on key foreign and defense policies. The administration's public response Tuesday to the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was decidedly favorable, with spokesmen using words such as `` extraordinary'' and `` striking'' to describe the Soviet diplomat's statements. In a speech Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> condemned the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 and, in effect, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was correct in contending that a controversial radar station in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> violated bilateral agreements. But one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking anonymously, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statements on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> may have been aimed at rallying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public opinion against continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been providing substantial assistance to the Afghan rebels and encouraging them not to enter peace negotiations with the pro-Moscow regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s admission that the invasion had set the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` against all of humanity'' but she added that the Kremlin should do more to erase its mistakes. Specifically, she encouraged the Soviets to transfer power from the `` illegitimate'' government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to a `` government acceptable to all the Afghan people.'' `` The legacy of the Soviet invasion continues as long as the current <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime retains power in the face of a determined effort by the Afghan people and the international community to see it removed,'' she said. The Afghan war has continued to rage even though the Soviets completed their troop pullout eight months ago. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates, the Soviets have been airlifting $ 250 million to $ 300 million worth of arms a month to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Soviet military involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, among other regional conflicts, was perhaps the main area of disagreement during <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s talks last month with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The administration was clearly elated over <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s remarks on the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar site Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said: `` We have long maintained that the radar is a violation of the ABM treaty. We therefore welcome Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statement just as we welcomed the Soviet decision in September to completely eliminate that radar.'' Other officials, insisting on anonymity, expressed concern that the Soviets might try to parlay their mea culpas over the radar issue into a campaign aimed at reversing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public support for the Strategic Defense Initiative. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said in a television interview today that the speech was almost certainly aimed at giving the Soviets leverage against the space-based missile defense system. `` One of the motives, I am sure, is to make it more difficult for us to withdraw from the ABM Treaty, which we should do,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program. `` And so this is part of the Soviet pattern of trying to prevent us from proceeding with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had argued that the Soviets could have utilized the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar to develop a first strike capability against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets. The Soviets have used the same argument in opposing SDI. One official said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statements on the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> site have immense `` propaganda potential'' if they weaken <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resolve to push ahead with the SDI program. The official added he believes it is essential for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to proceed with the program, contending that the Soviets themselves have their own SDI project under way. Still, the administration seemed pleased at the overall tone of <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s remarks and suggested that they bode well for the future. `` They're extraordinary,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. He called <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s candor `` a step in the right direction'' for arms control. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> called <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statements `` strikingly forthright admissions'' of past Soviet mistakes. `` They reflect new thinking and they demonstrate the Soviet acknowledgement of the importance of being honest about past Soviet policy,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A senior <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> transportation engineer told a seismic workshop four years ago there was no need to strengthen freeway columns until future earthquakes proved them vulnerable, state documents show. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelinski </PERSON>, head of the freeway retrofitting program for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said the strengthening was n't necessary because the state's project to tie roadbeds together with steel cables provided enough stability in an earthquake, according to the documents released Monday by the department. Some structural engineers have criticized <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s transportation department for not strengthening the columns on <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s double-decked <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION>, which collapsed during the Oct. 17 earthquake, killing more than three dozen people The freeway's roadbeds were tied together. The cause of the collapse is still undetermined, however. `` It should be noted,'' <PERSON> Zelinski </PERSON> said in a paper delivered at the 1985 workshop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, `` that column retrofits have been avoided by designing restraining features in a manner which circumvents collapse due to column damage. `` Review of behavior of retrofitted bridges during earthquakes will determine whether features will need improvement and whether columns need to be considered for retrofitting,'' he said. <PERSON> Zelinski </PERSON> has been ordered by state transportation officials and attorneys not to comment on his earlier remarks. However, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION>' structures division, said <PERSON> Zelinski </PERSON> still believes the roadbed tie-down system should be enough to prevent failures, although the freeway's collapse `` shakes his faith a little. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he thought the tie-down project has been highly effective. The state's program to strengthen columns through retrofitting also may have been delayed in part because <PERSON> Zelinski </PERSON> and other engineers did not believe it was necessary, said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` That tells you about why we have n't seen the need to move ... faster.'' Also Tuesday, a former state bridge designer charged that the <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION>, which opened in 1957, was not built to the highest standards of the time. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> See </PERSON>, who is now the public works director for the city of <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, said the freeway's columns were not sufficiently reinforced with horizontal steel supports. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said his staff is investigating See's allegations.

<TEXT>
 Novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> denied a newspaper's claim that he misled his publisher about the likely impact his novel `` The Satanic Verses'' would have on the Moslem world. In a letter published today in The Independent, <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> accuses the daily of telling a `` blatant untruth'' in a profile it published Saturday of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, head of Viking Penguin publishers. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding for eight months since the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called on Moslems to kill him for allegedly blaspheming their faith. The threat also extends to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s publishers, and The Independent's profile said <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> `` has been forced to spend weeks slipping through shadows.'' It said that when <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> first read the book, he `` missed the religious time bomb ticking inside its covers.'' `` <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was asked twice, once before <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON> bought the book and again afterward, what the now notorious Mahound chapter was supposed to mean,'' The Independent wrote. `` He seemed curiously reluctant to explain. ` Do n't worry,' he said at one point. ` It's not terribly important to the plot.''' In his letter, <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> wrote: `` This passage is a lie. As Penguin editorial staff in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> know, I discussed the background to ` The Satanic Verses' fully, answering all questions.'' He said he had `` failed to anticipate the distortions and falsifications to which my novel was subsequently subjected.'' But he insisted it was ludicrous to suggest he had dismissed some 75 pages of the novel as unimportant to the plot. `` The implication that I deceived Viking Penguin is wholly unjustified, and, in the present circumstances, injurious. Character assassination is also a sort of murder,'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> wrote. `` I am acutely conscious of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>'s present anguish ... as I'm sure he is of mine,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> also took issue with the newspaper's suggestion that since he had `` nothing to lose'' he was pressuring Penguin to produce a paperback version of `` The Satanic Verses,'' despite the danger that this would further inflame Moslem hostility. `` I'd like to think that your readers found the description of my present situation ... more than a little distasteful,'' he wrote. The letter was dated Oct. 23 and gave no indication of where it was written.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won back first place in the <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> television ratings as the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area earthquake delayed the World Series and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s prospects for another victory. The quake altered all three networks' schedules last week in one of the more inconsequential results of the disaster. Instead of an anticipated second week on top, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> fell to third place. The network was caught without alternative programming when its biggest night of the week, Tuesday, was pre-empted first by the World Series pregame show and then by coverage of the earthquake. The quake hit just as <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the third game between the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> was beginning in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Candlestick Park. The Tuesday night pregame show tied for 44th place. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had won the ratings race the previous week on the basis of the first two games, snapping <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s record 68-week string of first-place finishes. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers'' was first last week, closely followed by `` The Cosby Show.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s highest-ranked show was its Monday Night Football game between the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rams </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bills </ORGANIZATION>, which was 10th. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> survey with a weekly primetime average of 14.1. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 12.6 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.1. The ratings represent the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million households tuned into a program. Here are the Top 10: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers;'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show;'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World;'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Golden Girls;'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dear John'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes'' tied for fifth; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Empty Nest;'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries'' and the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Do You Know the Muffin Man?'' tied for eighth; and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Monday Night <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> Football. The World Series is not scheduled to resume until Friday, depending on weather and repairs to the ballpark. The networks' special coverage of the earthquake was not ranked by <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> because it was unscheduled and not sponsored. The network evening news shows had nearly 5 million extra viewers, apparently because of the quake. Here's how the networks did with follow-up coverage of the earthquake: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' in a tie for 20th place, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 48 Hours'' 29th, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> special report 34th, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` PrimeTime Live'' in a tie for 37th place, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s special report 43rd. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' led the evening news shows with a rating of 11.5. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had an 11.2 and NBC 10.7. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was rated for only four nights because the night of the earthquake it had pre-empted its <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> news feed for special coverage.

<TEXT>
 The Soviet foreign minister met jointly with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and one of their harshest foes today and said later his country is determined to maintain good relations with both sides. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also emphasized the need to clear up `` blank spots'' in the countries' history. One such `` blank spot'' is a World War II massacre of Polish officers, for which Soviet forces have generally been blamed. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met for more than an hour with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s first secretary, <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, and then invited <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> to join them. <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> is editor in chief of the pro-Solidarity <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> daily and spent nearly five years in jail for his opposition activites. <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a close adviser to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and perhaps <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s best-known critic of one-party rule, was the only reporter allowed into the room. The three talked for about 10 minutes before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> came out. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters he is willing to meet with `` every party, with anybody'' and said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants close relations with both the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new government, which is led by Solidarity. Speaking of `` blanks spots'' in Polish-Soviet history, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> promised they would be cleared up. `` We want only the truth. It is needed by our two nations and is in the interest of friendship,'' he said. Asked how much change the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would tolerate in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he responded: `` We do n't set up order in other countries. Would you want it to be so?'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Tuesday and, as a sign of goodwill, promised that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will maintain fuel deliveries crucial to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s survival. He also met Tuesday with <PERSON> Taduesz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-Communist prime minister, and the two announced that <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next month The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has said it views the radical political changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to be an internal matter. Its decision to allow <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to chart an independent course marked a significant shift in Soviet policy toward its East bloc allies. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and his Solidarity-led Cabinet have promised, however, to respect the country's military obligations to the Soviet-led alliance. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the highest-level Soviet official to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s took office in mid-August, held a meeting with the prime minister Tuesday that lasted an hour longer than planned. `` I am very happy about our many-faceted talk,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said after the two-hour meeting. `` I accepted the invitation to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with gratitude.'' He said the visit would be on Nov. 23. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniszewski </PERSON> said after the meeting that `` There are some problems, but they were discussed in the spirit of understanding and seeking solutions.'' He said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> pledged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would maintain its level of deliveries to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which is dependent on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for oil, gas, electricity and raw materials. That was a significant gesture because <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been having trouble delivering products to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> due to its protracted economic crisis. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> suffers from a shortage of industrial goods, high inflation and a $ 39 billion foreign debt. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> provides nearly 85 percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crude oil, 65 percent of its processed petroleum products and 72 percent of its iron ore. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will try to uncover the truth about the World War II massacre of 4,300 Polish soldiers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has not acknowledged official responsiblity for the crime, but it generally has been accepted that Soviet soldiers were to blame. The issue long has been a sore point in <LOCATION> Polish-Soviet </LOCATION> relations. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was asked by reporters if he and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> had discussed the issue. `` All questions, everything connected with history _ present and future _ were raised,'' he replied. `` We are going to study history and search for documents if they exist.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been pressing for a joint declaration of Soviet responsibility for the deaths. Hard-line factions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> so far have been reluctant to do this.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader today reversed the party's position and said pro-democracy activists will be invited to join in national talks on possible reforms. In another change, state-run media reported that the government will propose a law next month allowing all citizens to travel to the West and dropping requirements that family members stay behind as insurance. And party chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> hinted Tuesday he is considering amnesty for people jailed on charges of trying to flee West. Western sources estimate thousands are jailed on such charges. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, speaking in response to reporters' questions after meeting with a senior West German official, said pro-democracy activists could take part in the reform talks. `` No one will be excluded from the dialogue,'' he said. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> did not say whether the nation's growing opposition would be officially recognized, or whether challenges to the socialist foundation of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be tolerated. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials previously had made it clear that opposition groups would be excluded from such talks, and staunchly reaffirmed the country's socialist basis. In the first meeting between the new leader and a senior West German official, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> met for two hours with <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mischnick </PERSON>, parliamentary leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the junior partner in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s governing coalition. On Tuesday, about 12,000 East Germans defied a warning from <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and protested in the streets of the capital after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> confirmed him as president. Police did not intervene. After the ritual confirmation in the traditionally rubber-stamp chamber _ some deputies voted `` no'' for the first time in the country's history _ <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> called for an end to street demonstrations by advocates of a more open society. He also promised to investigate charges of police brutality during protests earlier this month and Communist authorities admitted, for the first time, that some police had used excessive force against peaceful activists. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was in charge of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s police at the time. The 52-year-old career politician replaced <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> last week as party leader, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s supreme leadership post, and promised `` a new course'' for the country that young skilled workers have been leaving by the tens of thousands. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Tuesday that when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> begins its next session Nov. 8, it will consider reform proposals including a more liberal travel law. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the party's ruling Politburo would propose a system under which every citizen could get a passport and be allowed to travel `` to all nations and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' It said the Politburo would call for an end to the current requirements that family members stay behind as insurance that the travelers will return, and that current demands for `` grounds'' to travel should be dropped. Since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its Western border last month, more than 50,000 East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which grants them automatic citizenship. Tens of thousands more have taken to the streets, saying they are staying to fight for reforms including free elections and speech. ADN said the Politburo expressed the hope that the new travel law can be put into effect before the end of this year. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> ran unopposed for the presidency and received 26 ` no' votes in the 500-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, with another 26 deputies abstaining His election triggered the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> demonstration, in which marchers demanding more democratic elections chanted `` Egon, who asked us?'' and `` We are the competition.'' The march was shown on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run television and reported by ADN with no hint of criticism. Witnesses estimated the number of marchers at 7,000, but <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported later that as many as 12,000 took part. No violence was reported between protesters and police, who directed traffic to keep the march route clear. More than 300,000 people had marched through the streets of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> Monday night in the largest demonstration in the country's 40 years An official newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>, charged today that governmental neglect has sparked the mass demonstrations in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. In his acceptance speech Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> called for an end to street protests but also said he would look into the police brutality charges. East German officials later admitted that police had attacked peaceful demonstrators. ADN said that 83 complaints were under investigation and that police had apologized in several cases where the allegations proved true.

 Air filled the tiny lungs of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> for the first time on Oct. 17 at 5:03 p.m.. One minute later, her new world shook violently `` I thought, ` We'll just have to wait until it stops, then they can sew me up,''' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> recalled one week after the bumpy delivery at <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Drs. <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Corby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> had just delivered 7-pound, 14-ounce <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> by Caesarean section when the operating room began shaking. `` The baby had just been born when the earthquake started. Things started moving around _ the lights started to sway, the walls were moving and things were bumping along,'' said <PERSON> Corby </PERSON>. At that moment, the newborn girl was whisked away to the nursery while <PERSON> Corby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> fought to stay on their feet to protect the mother and shield her from flying debris with their bodies. Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> said: `` The room started shaking and all I heard them say was, ` Let's get her -LRB- the baby -RRB- out of here.''' Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON>, 40, was awake during delivery but numbed from the waist down. Her husband, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, was at her side. `` There was n't much I could do really. I knew we'd get through it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON>. <PERSON> Corby </PERSON> was astonished by the way Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> handled the disaster. `` While we were sewing her up, she talked about what the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> reading would be,'' she said. `` He -LRB- Cupples -RRB- was in a bit of an altered state, though. He was laughing and telling his new daughter, ` You were born and the earth moved.' They named her <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> but during all this they said they considered calling her <PERSON> Eartha </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Corby </PERSON> said. There was even more levity in the delivery room. `` I said, ` Why do n't we do a tummy tuck while we're at it?''' the new mother said. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> is the first baby for Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON>, a personnel consultant. Her husband is an engineer. `` We have been thinking of all sorts of nicknames because of the earthquake,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> said from her <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> home Tuesday. `` Eartha, Quaker, Tremblor and <ORGANIZATION> Epi </ORGANIZATION> are the ones we've thought of. <PERSON> Epi </PERSON> might stick because her initials are E.P. and it also sounds like epicenter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> and her newborn went home from the hospital Friday. `` When I got home, I felt like I had been in a time warp. The first aftershock at home I started crying. It jolted me into reality,'' she said. At 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, one week after the delivery and the earthquake, Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> was nursing <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. `` I wondered if there would be an aftershock. There is still a feeling around here that history may repeat itself.''

<HEAD>Communist Party Allows For Possible Multi-Party Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has for the first time indicated it may allow a multi-party democracy, according to an official party platform released today. The document, adopted at last week's session of the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency, declared the party will support `` the development of political pluralism -LRB- and -RRB- individual rights and freedoms of individuals.'' It also called for free and democratic elections, for independence of the judiciary and for `` guaranteeing citizens the right to form political associations and -LRB- independent -RRB- trade unions.'' The platform, likely to be adopted at the next party congress scheduled for Jan. 20, appears to be the result of a compromise between Communist reformers and conservatives. The document stopped short of advocating establishment of opposition parties but stressed the party will support the setting up of `` citizens' political organizations ... which ensure the free competition of political ideas and programs.'' The platform, however, made clear the party did not `` accept the reduction of political pluralism exclusively to a multi-party system, as this is only one of the possible forms of political pluralism.'' <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s liberal northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> already has allowed the establishment of several independent political parties and plans to hold its first free Western-style parliamentary elections next year. But the largest republic, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, strongly opposes multi-party democracy and is planning to hold its own legislative elections next month in which only officially sanctioned candidates will be allowed to run. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is supported in its stand by <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s military, whose entire officer corps is almost entirely made up of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members.

 A high school teacher suspended for refusing to wear a tie says he may not accept his job back despite a judge's order that he be reinstated. `` I wo n't go back until I get something in writing that says, ` You're welcome to walk into the building,''' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> following a ruling Tuesday that his constitutional rights were violated by a dress code banning denim for teachers and requiring male teachers to wear ties. <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> reinstated with back pay and court costs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 46, a math teacher at Point Pleasant High for 20 years, was fired Dec. 21 after being suspended three times for refusing to follow the dress code. A lawyer for the school board says an appeal of <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>'s ruling is virtually certain, and <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> says that would take months. So for now, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> says he will continue working at his <LOCATION> Gallipolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, farm and auto repair shop. `` Knowing the people of <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> the way I do, they'll take the next eight months to appeal it, and we wo n't know anything until June or July,'' he said. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor acting as the school board's attorney, says she'll ask <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> for a stay of his order until the appeal is settled. She said she does n't plan to file for the stay until after the board's Nov. 6 meeting. She said, however, that if <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> shows up for work, the board will file for a stay immediately. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also said the dress code, which was revised to delete the tie requirement, remains in effect. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> contended that his apparel, usually jeans and a cotton work shirt, caused no problems until Superintendent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> issued the dress code. In his ruling, <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had been praised as an `` excellent teacher'' who had good rapport with his students and said his dress had caused no problems. `` This dress code involves constitutional considerations which include the right of the individual teacher to dress as he or she chooses so long as no disruptive or distracting effects occur which are detrimental to the educational process,'' the judge wrote.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Oct. 23 <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake: Residents of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area are starting to pick up the pieces ... after the massive earthquake that killed scores of people, injured and left homeless thousands more, and caused billions of dollars in damages. Despite the toll, some 75,000 football fans saw the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers play in <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> stadium on Sunday, defeating the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION>, and it was announced that the World Series between the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> would resume ... Friday. Such events perhaps are part of the answer to a question which must be asked: Why will millions of people continue to live in a known fault zone that promises even larger earthquakes with greater death and destruction? One obvious reason is that all of us place our lives and fortunes on the line every day. More than 50,000 persons die each year in auto accidents alone. Another part of the answer lies with the unquenchable part of the human spirit that has always defied threats to life and economic stability. But together, are these reasons the full answer to the question of why virtually all of those in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area are now beginning to rebuild their lives and stake out new futures? No, they are not. A certain state of mind exists in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in general and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in particular. A youthful exhilaration exists there that comes from the outdoor lifestyle of swimming, surfing and skiing and being on the cutting edge of much change in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society. For millions, the risk of life in that region is worth it.

 Oct. 22, <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- S.D. -RRB- American News on the earthquake and compassion: Last Wednesday -LRB- Oct. 18 -RRB-, the switchboard at <ORGANIZATION> KYW-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> logged nearly 500 angry calls between 8:30 a.m. and noon. They came in response to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake that expanded the `` Today'' show and cut the regular morning lineup. The quake put the Bay Bridge World Series on hold. The next morning sportscasters, with a token nod to the tragedy of death and devastated lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, clamored to know when the series would resume. Incredible. That within hours attention could so easily turn from real-life battles for survival to the contrived struggle of a game. Disquieting that viewers would respond so angrily at being denied an hour of watching actors mimic tragedy. Distressing that even a few Americans were unwilling to pause _ and to make the adjustments in their daily lives that comprise compassion.

 Oct. 24 <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Daily Mail on the earthquake and baseball: Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> deserves special praise for his actions since the Oct. 17 earthquake His decision to delay the World Series reveals a solid set of priorities. Candlestick Park probably could have withstood an early resumption of the series. Bay area residents certainly could use a diversion from the task of cleaning up. But resuming play was n't worth the extra burden the game would place on the area's already overtaxed highway and public safety systems. Having the games on weekday afternoons to meet the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s prime-time schedule would push more traffic onto <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s weakened transportation system at rush hour. Given how much overemphasis is placed on sports in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>'s willingness to postpone the Series is heartening. Baseball, after all, is what you're supposed to do after the real work is done.

 Oct. 23 Las Cruces -LRB- N.M. -RRB- Sun-News on flag burning: It's probably a good thing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> killed a proposed constitutional amendment against burning or otherwise desecrating the American flag. The Bill of Rights has stood us in good stead for two centuries now, and it is n't wise to tinker with it. The issue was understandably emotion-charged. The senators understood very well that their constituents love the flag and want it protected. Probably some of them voted for the amendment though they privately deemed it unwise, and were sure it would be defeated, in order to appear to be on the side of the angels. But a number of influential voices, including those of several leading conservatives, had been raised against the amendment. The gist of what they had to say was that flag burning does not pose any such threat to the public order as to justify altering out basic guarantees of liberty and due process.

The boiling cauldron of emotions over flag burning this past summer has been reduced to a low simmer, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has finally put the issue to rest, as it should have. Meddling with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution is unnecessary. Besides, a flag-burning amendment would have weakened the very freedoms that the flag represents. Hurray for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and for the red, white and blue.

 Oct. 19 The <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> -LRB- Mo. -RRB- Globe on foreign investment: <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has set its cap to stifle foreign investment, which if happens would be a gross miscarriage of lawmaking. The legislative move doubtless has been spurred by a surge of foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent years, causing people to worry about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dependence on other countries. Such concerns are unwarranted for a couple reasons. One, foreign investment is not nearly as extensive as popularly thought.

 Oct. 23 <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> -LRB- Miss. -RRB- Evening Post on coca growing: Years before crack became the scourge of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Bolivian peasants grew coca plants. Some of the leaves were sent aboard to be processed into illegal cocaine, but mounds of them wound up in the marketplaces of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. The highlands Indians were in the habit of chewing the leaves to help numb their hunger and the piercing cold. The presidents of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> surely must understand that many Indians view coca as a medicinal plant that helps them survive their harsh environment. Now, with demand for cocaine and crack soaring in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the peasants have come to see it as an export crop that helps ease their pain with money. The peasants, who find themselves whipsawed between drug outlaws, guerrillas and the government, need a substitute for their coca cultivation. The presidents of the three drug-troubled Andean countries decided at their meeting to invite President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to meet with them within 90 days. We hope he goes with some concrete ideas for wooing the coca-growing peasants away from the drug traffickers and left-wing guerrillas. The possibilities include targeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural assistance to the remote regions where coca is now grown. The peasants need help in modernizing their herding and growing practices. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could provide farm equipment and loans for growing legal crops. Easing trade barriers into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for legal agricultural exports from the coca-growing areas may also help.

 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, has invited <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem lawmakers to a meeting to discuss their plan for ending the country's 14-year-old civil war, a newspaper said today. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has criticized the plan for not setting a deadline for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but was quoted as telling <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that he has not completely rejected it. Sources said Lebanese Christian legislators, who agreed to the accord in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Sunday, feared <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> would have them arrested if they returned to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he would guarantee their safety. `` I have not said a categoric ` no' to the accord,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as saying from his compound at <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` On the contrary, I accept all the institutional reforms. Whether they are good or bad, I wo n't interfere. It's an affair between Lebanese,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. The 63 Lebanese legislators, evenly divided among Moslems and Maronite Christians, met in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for three weeks to come up with a plan to end the war. The changes they approved Sunday would shift political control from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority to the Moslem majority. On Monday, the committee issued a document calling on Parliament to meet no later than Nov. 7 in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to ratify the reforms and elect a president. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> invited the legislators, even those he considers traitors, to a meeting. `` The text of Taif has n't been ratified yet. If they are convincing, maybe I would be in agreement with them,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was quoted as saying. He also said he would accept a new president `` even if they decide the president should no longer be a Maronite.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who declared a `` war of liberation'' in March to drive the 40,000 Syrian troops from the country, found fault with the accord for not setting a date for a Syrian withdrawal. `` It's a vague redeployment, then, two years after the installation of new institutions, a retreat. How much time is all this going to take?,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also said he would not run for the presidency, <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> reported. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, popular <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> deputy <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> became the first politician to announce publicly he would be a candidate. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, who has been living in self-imposed exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> following attempts to assassinate him in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said he would remain in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and not travel to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for the election. Also today, rival Shiite Moslem militias clashed in a brief firefight in Syrian-policed south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said one person was killed and two were wounded. The clash pitted gunmen of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, against fighters of the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia. A police spokesman said the 30-minute clash with automatic rifles broke out over `` traffic priority'' between a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and an Amal militiaman in a narrow alley of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 A mob witness whose protective custody is under investigation `` played court'' with his family in a judge's chambers while they lived in an apartment in a police station, his wife says. Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Tuesday announced an internal investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over the custody of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, a three-time murderer who was a key witness in two trials of alleged organized crime figures. It will be at least the third investigation of the confessed murderer, who died of a heart attack in June 1988 while on his way to an unsupervised skydiving trip in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. He had been expected to testify against other alleged organized crime figures. Packages containing 9 grams of cocaine were found in <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s parachute bag Later investigations showed that while in police custody, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was paid at least $ 98,000, took other trips, charged meals and liquor to the state and bought bullets and jewelry at taxpayers' expense. <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON>, who said he did n't know <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was in department custody, ordered the probe because of the `` outrageous revelations'' of recent weeks, including reports that a police officer was videotaped joking with <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> about the free ride they were getting. In the 30 months <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 43, was in police custody, he was kept at a police station apartment with his wife, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON>, and some of his seven children, then transferred in January 1988 to a safe house while he served a 10-year sentence for murder. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> told WPRI-TV in an interview broadcast Tuesday that while the family lived in the apartment at the police station `` the policeman would stand in the hall and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and I would go skating, and our daughter had a little three-wheeler and would be skating all over. ... `` We went into the -LRB- municipal -RRB- judge's chambers and played court, and we had fun,'' she said. The apartment formerly had been a matron's living quarters. The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> had a videotape of a police officer joking with her husband. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> told the newspaper the tape shows Detective <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> with his arm around her husband's shoulders saying, `` The criminal justice system has been good to us, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, huh?'' Cross, who was recently transferred from the detective division to the auto squad, which investigates stolen cars, was not in the office for comment Tuesday, said Police Officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> told WPRI-TV that his comment was `` play acting'' to make <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> feel at home. WPRI-TV broadcast footage Tuesday that it said was taken as <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> cavorted with his police keepers at a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> motel pool. The station said it obtained the footage from Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. The film showed the incident with <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and pictures the station said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> took of a new van, one of several vehicles he apparently bought with a $ 20,000 credit union loan obtained while under police protection. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> also videotaped a police officer sleeping in a poolside lounge chair while he was supposed to be guarding the witness. `` Hard time, tough duty,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said on the tape as he laughed. The sleeping officer has since committed suicide, <ORGANIZATION> WPRI </ORGANIZATION> said. Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> announced a state police investigation of the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> case last week at the recommendation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney.

 Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has condemned reforms by some of his Soviet bloc neighbors, telling a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> plenum in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> that they represent an abandonment of socialism. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who has ruled for 24 years, also accused unnamed `` imperialist circles'' of trying to destroy world communism, the official Agerpres news agency reported today. The two-day plenum debating ideological questions began one day earlier than scheduled. Observers speculated that the early opening may have been prompted by unease over Monday's mass commemoration in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> of its 1956 anti-communist uprising. More than 100,000 people gathered for the officially condoned rallies in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, which were broadcast nationally by Hungarian television and could be watched by many of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s 1.7-million-member Hungarian minority <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> rules over an old-style communist state clinging to tough economic policies that have produced the Soviet bloc's worst food and energy shortages. He criticized <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by name in a speech last week for their market-oriented economic reforms. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist government and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this week declared itself a democracy. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> even changed its name. The Romanian party plenum, also called to discuss better food supplies for its hard-pressed people, is the last such meeting prior to a party congress scheduled for Nov. 20-25. The congress formally is the highest decision-making body of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Steps are taken in some -LRB- Soviet bloc -RRB- countries that weaken the positions of socialism and open the way to the reinstatement of capitalism in various forms,'' Agerpres, monitored in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> as telling the plenum Tuesday. `` Some openly declare that they want to take various capitalist countries for a model,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said. `` It is hard to understand, though, that socialism can be developed and improved by taking as a model the capitalist system divided into classes of oppressors and oppressed.'' Although he named no countries, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> clearly targeted <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as he spoke of economic reforms that would `` open the path to the lowering of the people's living standard. `` Facts in some socialist countries that switch to the ` market economy,' -LRB- such as -RRB- mounting inflation and profiteering ... spell danger to the very development of the socialist society,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said. In his address, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> made clear that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> will stick to the centralized economy that has brought it widespread food shortages and have left many Romanian houses cold and streets dark in the past four winters. He warned that `` the imperialist circles' actions against communism ... are a great danger for detente and cooperation. `` If they continue they will inevitably lead to an even more drastic deterioration of the world situation,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said without elaboration. Romanian exiles abroad listening to his speech broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucharest </ORGANIZATION> noted that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> stuttered and raised his voice several times throughout the two-hour, frequently emotional, speech.

 The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> may become another <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> if anti-narcotics agencies can not stop the increasingly powerful drug rings operating in this country, a senator said today. `` Precisely, if we do not do something about this, there might come a time when we will see the spectacle of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> becoming like <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where drug lords even have armies, helicopters, planes and even tanks,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> made the statement during a public hearing on last week's report given by Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> alleging that at least 17 military officials are protecting drug syndicates Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, admitted during the hearing that there are military men involved in drug rings, but he said officials are doing their best to weed them out. At least 40 officers have been ousted since <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>'s report and assigned to combat units fighting communist guerrillas in the countryside, <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> added. He said the drug problem has grown swiftly in the last few years. Most drug syndicates operating in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s so-called `` Golden Triangle'' of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> use the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as a relay point to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and some <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, he said. A total of 2,543 people were arrested for various drug-related offenses last year, and 1,884 were arrested from January to September this year, <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said. But Sen. <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> said most of those arrested and convicted were small-time pushers, and none of the three major local drug groups' leaders or their top managers has been arrested Col. <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, chief of the Constabulary's <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said he plans to change men under his command as often as possible to prevent them from fraternizing with drug ring members. `` The temptation is just too great for soldiers whose average salary is about 80 pesos -LRB- $ 3.60 -RRB- a day,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said. During the hearing, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> played the first of at least 15 tapes of interviews with drug pushers, military and police officers who gave names of officers involved in corruption involving the drug trade.

 A husband hurled a kerosene lamp during a fight with his wife early today, triggering a massive seven-hour fire that left 31,000 people homeless and one person dead in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> slum, officials said. Investigators said initial reports indicated the fire started in the house of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON>, the lone fatality. They said his unidentified wife was hurt when <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON> threw the kerosene lamp during an argument. Residents said the fire in suburban <LOCATION> Pasay </LOCATION> city spread rapidly because of the fire department's slow response and poor equipment. One resident said a fire truck arrived but it had no water. Another firetruck stalled and blocked a street, and had to be pushed away by the residents, witnesses said. Fire investigator <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> said they responded immediately as soon as the fire station received the alarm at 2:30 a.m., but vehicles parked on the narrow streets in the community prevented firetrucks from moving closer to the blaze. The fire was put out seven hours later. The Department of Social Work and Development said the houses of more than 6,000 families were destroyed or damaged, with a total of 31,000 people without shelter. Victims are being sheltered in a school house and an unoccupied private compound, officials said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers today welcomed Soviet promises to cut its powerful military forces but urged the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to do more to slash its tactical nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and other ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also applauded in their final statement <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s pledge to remove a disputed radar station in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> cautioned that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remains a powerful military force and said `` there is great uncertainty about how events will unfold in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Wrapping up two days of nuclear strategy talks on the southern Portuguese coast, the officials said they `` looked forward to the prompt and full implementation of this commitment.'' After the meeting, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was to fly to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for talks with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials on the European leg of a three-week foreign tour. In the final statement, the ministers said they `` were encouraged by the changes underway in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and some of its allies.'' `` Nevertheless, we recognized the continuing capability of the forces of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact for offensive military action,'' it said. It expressed concern about `` substantial capabilities'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s space program and its nuclear modernization program. `` We welcomed the announced <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact unilateral force reductions and looked forward to their full implementation,'' the statement said. However, the ministers said the cuts `` would have little effect on the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's nuclear capability and, in particular, on their continuing massive superiority in short-range nuclear missile systems.'' `` We therefore called again on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce unilaterally its short-range missile systems to current <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> levels,'' the statement said. The ministers' agenda was somewhat overshadowed by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s unusually candid speech on Monday. He told the Soviet legislature that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station violated the 1972 U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and said it would be removed. The facility stood in the way of further arms treaties, he said. `` It was an acknowledgement of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has maintained for a long time,'' said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We obviously applaud this recognition'' and the pledge to dismantle the installation, he said. West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> called <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s speech `` remarkable'' and `` a true sign of glasnost -LRB- openness -RRB-.'' `` The fact that he stands up and says straight out that <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> was a violation of the -LRB- ABM treaty -RRB- is a whole new language,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the decision to take down the giant, phased-array radar had been criticized internally. But, he said, `` We are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has argued the ABM treaty prohibited the deployment of large radar stations, capable of giving early warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Soviet territory. The Krasnoyarsk radar is deep within <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. In his speech, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also called for dissolving <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Not surprisingly, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials did not share his vision of an end to the Western allliance. `` I can assure you, we're not thinking of disbanding <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said. All 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations, except <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, attended the meeting. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> does not belong to the alliance's integrated military structure. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, which has no armed forces, has observer status.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is trimming tank production by half for the next five years, building only 850 tanks annually, according to a report published today. Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> made the promise during meetings earlier this month with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, according to unidentified defense officials cited by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Vilamoura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, today, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials have `` indicated it is their intention to produce fewer tanks than they have in the past.'' `` We have seen some beginning signs that in fact that transition may be occurring,'' he said at a news conference on the final day of a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nuclear strategy session. Even so, he said, `` As of today, their tank production still far exceeds that of the West, all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations combined, although it does appear to be lower than it has been in the recent past.'' Pressed about a promised reduction to 850 tanks a year, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> replied, `` I would n't want to be more precise than I have been.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated annual Soviet tank production at 3,500 in a total <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact output of 4,200, but Soviet Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in July the figure was about 1,700. The newspaper said DIA recently reported a reduction in Soviet tank production. If <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>'s pledge of an additional 50 percent reduction is realized, Soviet tank production would be about 850 per year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production is about 775 in a total <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> output of 925 a year, the newspaper said. An unidentified senior defense official told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the production cut may be a result of the Soviets reconsidering what kinds of weapons are effective. `` While tank production is decreasing, production of artillery and armored personnel carriers is increasing,'' the official said.

 The fatal explosions that ripped through a plastics plant also may send shock waves through the industry, driving up plastics prices worldwide, analysts said. Analysts said if the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant is destroyed or shut down for a while, manufacturers of plastic products like milk jugs and grocery bags could be scrambling for plastic at higher prices. `` If the whole thing goes down, there are going to be shortages all over the place,'' said analyst <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhlke </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DeWitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based chemical consulting company. The blasts at the plant killed as many as 23 workers and injured 124. Two bodies have been recovered and up to 21 others are missing and presumed dead. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, which supplies up to 19 percent of a common plastic base, has been leading several companies building factories along <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>. Company officials said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> supplies about a third of the world's plastics and its polyethylene plant No. 5 represented a large chunk of their production power. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> of the company's <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, headquarters said the effects of losing the plant were unclear. `` We're very early in the assessment,'' <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> bought the 800-acre <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> plant in 1948, and turned it into a huge complex employing more than 900 people. It produces more than 2 billion pounds of plastics per year, three-quarters of it polyethylene. `` The damage we know of was primarily to the polyethylene plant,'' <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> said. The plant was scheduled to increase production 15 percent in 1990. He said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has another plant at the complex that makes 500 million pounds of polypropylene annually, which is used carpet fibers and films. And another part produces K-Resin for plastic water bottles and rigid, but flexible plastic cups like the ones used on airlines. That production was to increase production by 50 percent in 1990. Consultant <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Bonner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said he had brushed off talk of a polyethylene price increase the industry hoped to see Nov. 1, but the <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> explosion may allow a rise of about 3 cents per pound. Product in storage will only last about five weeks, he said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> confirmed today that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have seized a key Cambodian town near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border and captured tanks and artillery. But <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON>, the first top official to confirm that the western town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> was in guerrilla hands, said neither the Cambodian government nor guerrilla forces are strong enough to win a clear victory. `` In the end they will have to compromise and come back to negotiations,'' he told a weekly news briefing. The guerrillas said the victory Sunday opened the door for an assault 40 miles to the northeast on <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city after the nation's capital, <LOCATION> Pnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio on Tuesday called on officials and soldiers of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-installed government to quit. `` Parents and compatriots ... please call on your children and husbands to quickly desert for home ... in order to stay alive,'' said the broadcast, a text of which was seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today. Army officers had vowed to hold onto <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>'s gem-rich area seized by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who have been fighting to topple the government for the past 11 years. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is leading efforts to restart the peace process, stalled since the failure of an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in August. The main stumbling block was the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government's refusal to agree to a government role for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which massacred hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during four years of rule before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in 1978 and ousted it from power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> tried to turn <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> into an agrarian commune. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> controlled <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, the minister said, `` Yes it is true.'' He added that according to <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military reports, the guerrillas captured nine artillery pieces, four tanks, six trucks and large quantities of ammunition in their assault on the town. Thai military sources said <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government forces had pulled back to Route 10 linking <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, but the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> continued its attacks and was trying to seize more territory. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed 120 government soldiers and captured 17 in their final assualt on <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, the sources said. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the strongest member of the guerrilla coalition that also includes the non-Communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the army of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The two non-Communist groups also have scored significant victories in western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> since late September, when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said it pulled out the last of its troops. <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> said today it was uncertain the two factions could hold on to their gains. On Tuesday, heavy fighting was reported along Route 69 as the guerrillas of the liberation front advanced towards <LOCATION> Svey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION>, which they described as the only barrier between them and the strategic town of <LOCATION> Sisophon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON>, deputy commander of the front, claimed Tuesday his group seized eight small government outposts and cut Route 69 south and north of <LOCATION> Svey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION>.

 At least 20 policemen and soldiers were arrested on charges of rape, attempted extortion and other crimes during the struggle with Sinhalese extremists, officials said today. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said several military officers were among those arrested in the past month. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanasinghe </PERSON>, the army commander, said if the arrested are found guilty `` they will be dealt with most severely.'' <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said among those arrested were five policemen in a <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> suburb on charges of raping a young Sinhalese woman they detained for questioning after claiming she belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Sinhalese group. Police arrested four army lieutenants who allegedly posed as front members and tried to extort money from a wealthy businessman in the town of <LOCATION> Wellawatte </LOCATION> just south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, who is also deputy defense minister. The officials commented after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, an independent newspaper, voiced concern about an increase in the number of serious crimes blamed on police. At least 5,000 people have been killed in the Sinhalese heartland of central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since July 1987, when the government signed an Indian-brokered accord designed to end an insurgency by Tamil militants in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The government has blamed most of the deaths on the front, which has assassinated fellow Sinhalese who serve or back the government. However, human rights activists, opposition politicians and religious leaders say government forces and pro-government vigilante groups are responsible for many killings. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> accuses the government of selling out the rights of the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> majority by making too many concessions to the Tamil minority. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, account for 18 percent and say they are discriminated against. Tamil guerrillas launched a series of massacres of Sinhalese civilians. Those attacks, plus the ensuing war pitting the guerrillas against Sri Lankan soldiers and later Indian peacekeepers, have claimed 11,000 lives since the Tamil separatist insurrection began in 1983.

Their deaths touched off three days of racial disturbances in January. <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>, who will rule on Black's motion for change of venue after hearing more testimony and arguments today, said Tuesday he did n't need to hear lengthy testimony about the possibility of violence. `` There very well may be post-trial difficulties,'' said <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>. `` But we do n't need individuals testifying to that.'' One person was killed, 11 others were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned in the rioting after <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was shot while being chased by police. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> was fatally injured when the motorcycle crashed. The defense attorney had subpoenaed scores of witnesses and wanted to enter newspaper clippings, videotapes and other documents into evidence to show that public agencies were preparing for more violence. `` Jurors are going to think if they find my client guilty, there is not going to be a riot, but if they find not guilty, there is going to be a riot,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` It's unfair for ordinary people to have that much responsibility on their shoulders.'' But <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> threw out most of the subpoenas and limited the riot testimony during the change of venue hearing to police reports from four previous racial disturbances in the 1980s, all of which resulted after a jury found a policeman was innocent of shooting a black man. The judge and attorneys decided Monday to seat a large jury pool just before the change of venue motions so the panel could be ordered to avoid reading or listening to testimony on the motions. Prosecutors sought to quash <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s subpoenas, but did not dispute the threat of violence in case of acquittal. `` There is a degree of probability that a riot will occur,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney. Police have acknowledged contingency plans for a post-trial riot, including the purchase of 700 gas masks, arrangements for use of two armored vehicles and the possible use of the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION> to house those arrested during any disturbances. <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> said careful questioning of potential jurors should determine whether their deliberations will be affected by the chance of possible riots. `` I have no doubts that there are a number of individuals in this community who will accept that responsibilty, as difficult as it may be,'' he said.

<HEAD>Possible Mercy Killing Probed at New Haven Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The death of a hospital patient is being investigated as a possible mercy killing, and two doctors have been barred from practicing at the hospital until the review is completed, officials said today. Dr. <PERSON> Viswa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, a heart surgeon, was suspended Oct. 4 after the death the same day of <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, said officials at the Hospital of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raphael </LOCATION>. A second doctor, a resident at the hospital, was placed on a leave of absence, the hospital said. The second doctor was not identified. Hospital spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said today an investigation was begun because of the `` circumstances surrounding the death,'' but he would not elaborate. He said <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s family was notified of the investigation on the day of his death. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> did not want to comment on the allegations, a secretary at his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> office said today. She said he was referring all calls to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raphael </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Innebell </PERSON>, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday as saying she never asked <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> to put her husband out of his suffering. She said she took her husband to the hospital after he suffered what she thought was a stroke. Doctors found a blood clot and decided to operate, but <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> never regained consciousness after the surgery, she said. `` I never would have asked the doctor to let my husband die. My husband was a beautiful man,'' she told the Register. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s death certificate says his thoracic aorta, a major blood vessel, burst. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> would not comment on whether the hospital believed the doctors may have acted on their own or heeded a request from the family. Euthanasia is illegal in all 50 states, though the practice is considered common. In most cases, a doctor either withholds or withdraws a supportive treatment that might prolong life in a terminal illness. An investigation by <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>'s medical board into the possibility of a mercy killing could take from a week to two months, said hospital president <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rissing </PERSON>. The hospital said it notified both the state medical examiner's office and the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> Quality Assurance Division No doctor has ever been convicted of a mercy killing in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Minister Supports Charge That Abernathy Lied About King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A minister has backed up claims that the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> lied when he wrote that the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had two encounters with women the night before he was killed. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s autobiography, `` And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' suggests that King had extramarital affairs and contends he was with two women and physically fought with a third the night before his April 4, 1968, assassination in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The book has been widely criticized by others in the civil rights movement. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday, the Rev. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> had passed out drunk on the night in question. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s statement supports a charge made earlier by <PERSON> Adjua </PERSON> <PERSON> Abi </PERSON> <PERSON> Naantaanbuu </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> woman who said she was with King and <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> the night before King was killed. Ms. <PERSON> Naantaanbuu </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> at the news conference, said <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> asked her to prepare dinner for King's group at her home and <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> had several drinks. `` Following dinner, Rev. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, who had had too much to drink, asked -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Naantaanbuu </PERSON> -RRB- if he could lie down on her bed,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` She directed him to her bedroom, where he remained asleep until about 3 a.m.'' Ms. <PERSON> Naantaanbuu </PERSON> said the only time she was alone with <PERSON> King </PERSON> was when they were trying to awaken <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>. She said she drove <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> back to the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>, where <PERSON> King </PERSON> was assassinated hours later. The news conference was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> and Beneficiaries of the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>.

 Folks in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> may have been out of luck if they tried to buy fresh <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> strawberries last Wednesday and Thursday. Electrical failures after last Tuesday's earthquake meant 125,000 crates of berries, many bound for East and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> markets from this farming community, were left unrefrigerated overnight. By the time they reached their destinations, they were spoiled. A week after the quake forced more than 1,000 residents into tents and shelters, employers still are assessing their losses. `` I would not be one to say losses will be minimal. Under the circumstances, they might be considered minimal, but to the individual they are pretty severe,'' said <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Agricultural Commissioner <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>. An estimated $ 5 million to $ 6 milion worth of crops were bruised or damaged when the quake toppled storage bins, according to <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> of the Agricultural Extension Service. And losses at the plants that process 40 percent of the country's frozen foods wo n't be known until workers determine how much of the produce shaken from 30-foot-high shelves can be repacked and how much must be thrown out. Most companies say those losses should be small, indicating that while production lines and shipments of frozen broccoli, cauliflower and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> sprouts have been slowed, the industry is n't devastated. `` I do n't think there's a doubt the industry will rebound,'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said. `` It's the heart and soul of the area.'' More than $ 7 million worth of packaged vegetables spilled onto the warehouse floor at the <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> frozen food company. But President <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said he expects most of the vegetables can be repacked. `` We're hoping $ 500,000 -LRB- in losses -RRB- is a worst case,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` We're hoping we can get it down to a 5 percent loss of what's on the floor. Our focus is going to be on shipping merchandise, ship now and clean up later. We've got to ship to create space to speed up the clean-up.'' <PERSON> Strawberry </PERSON> packers are expecting very little loss. `` The season ends Nov. 1, so we're fortunate it happened at this time. There's not really much to recover from since we're near the end anyway,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Naturipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> But stalled production will be felt strongly by the 7,000 residents who harvest crops from local fields or work in the food processing plants here. The personal losses they have suffered have been compounded by the lack of a place to work. <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> expects to be closed for at least two weeks, leaving 600 people out of work, and <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is operating with about 200 of its 900 employees. `` Not only have they lost their jobs, but there are no alternatives left in town,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. Even the agriculture industry, which makes up 65 percent of the community's economy, may not be strong enough to rebuild the town by itself. `` We have quite a large population in the city who work in agriculture, and all the downtown store owners depend on people to spend their paychecks at the store,'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said. `` A lot of people's homes are destroyed,'' he added. `` Those people may work in agriculture, but that's not going to help.''

The president also called <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to discuss the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and on Tuesday he called the pope, who has made repeated efforts to promote a peaceful settlement in the 14-year civil war between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian and Moslem factions.

 The city council is asking the state and county to reopen the murder case of civil rights leader <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> more than a quarter-century afer he was gunned down. A council member said the move indicates how much attitudes have changed. `` Hopefully, the district attorney will follow through to correct an injustice of the past,'' Councilman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said Tuesday after the vote. `` The motive for introducing this resolution was to begin healing a festering wound created by a subversion of justice by the state <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said of the now-defunct segregation watchdog agency. `` I think it was incumbent upon the city council to protect the rights of one of its citizens who was murdered by bigotry and hatred.'' The city council's vote came a day after The Clarion-Ledger, a Jackson newspaper, reported that in 1964 investigators from the sovereignty commission helped the defense screen prospective jurors at the first of two trials of <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, who was charged in <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>' death. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>'s resolution asked the state attorney general and <LOCATION> Hinds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney to reopen the investigation and prosecution in connection with the civil rights leader's June 12, 1963, slaying. A secretary in the office of District Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said he would be out of town all week and and no one else could comment on whether he would reopen the case. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a special assistant to Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, said the decision would be up to <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. `` We would, however, offer him any assistance, if he so requests,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. The council, which has a majority of white members, voted 4-2, with one council member absent. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> was tried twice in 1964 by all-white juries for the murder of <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> field secretary who was gunned down in the driveway of his <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home. Both trials ended in hung juries. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s fingerprint was on a gun found in bushes near the slaying, and witnesses placed his car near the scene. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said his gun was stolen. Councilman E C <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said Tuesday that he voted for the resolution because he'd like to see the case solved. `` Primariy, it's clear that the murderer is still free, and so if by reopening the investigation we can bring the murderer to justice, then I think that's what should happen,'' he said. Councilman <PERSON> Derwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyles </PERSON>, who voted against the resolution, said Monday, `` As far as I'm concerned, that comes under the heading of the district attorney and the attorney general, and I do n't personally think I should be telling them what to do. `` I think if Mr. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> was here, he'd tell us we have more important things to do than that,'' said <PERSON> Boyles </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today began a visit to a thriving Soviet neighbor, seeking Finnish help in bolstering his country's ailing economy. Accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was given a red-carpet airport welcome by President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> and driven under overcast skies to the waterfront presidential residence in downtown <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> has long sought to maintain its independence and neutrality, but for centuries it has generally been subservient to its giant neighbor. The nations fought bitter wars twice during World War II, and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> each time was forced to grant territorial concessions to the Soviet aggressors. Though long considered to be under <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s thumb, increasingly liberal East European countries and Soviet republics are using <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> as a model of how to cooperate with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, maintain independence and run an effective economy. A handful of demonstrators were among several hundred Finns who lined the street near the palace to greet the Soviet leader, many cheering and waving small Finnish and Soviet flags. The demonstrators wanted their government to seek the return of <LOCATION> Karelia </LOCATION>, an eastern region which <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> ceded to the Soviets in 1944. `` Give us back our <LOCATION> Karelia </LOCATION>!'' the protesters shouted in Finnish as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reviewed the honor guard in a light rain. `` I want the Soviets to discuss with us whether they would return it, since they said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> took it and that it was an unwarranted aggression. ... What would be wrong with correcting that mistake?'' said <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Siirala </PERSON>, 66, who said he was born in the annexed territory. Finnish officials have said they did not expect the issue to be raised during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s three-day visit, and they said most Finns accept Soviet control of the region. About 400,000 Finns were displaced by the annexation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose economic reforms need an infusion of Western technology and business acumen, planned to sign a five-year trade agreement and several specific accords for new joint businesses. One agreement is to set the groundwork for new industries in the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, which until recently was a closed military area. It is the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> and the base for northern defenses. In the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> entourage was <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. His inclusion reflected recognition of the cultural links between the Finns and the people of the Baltic republic across the Gulf of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. Soviet government spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, also in the entourage, reiterated in an interview that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has no plans to hinder <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries instituting democratic reform. `` The <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> doctrine as you called it is dead and there is no hope of revival,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' referring to the concept of intervention named after the late Soviet leader. `` These countries _ <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and others _ are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, which we want to disband together simultaneously with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> pact, and they are still members of the mutual council on economic assistance,'' he said. Despite a bloody history, the Soviets and Finns have close business ties, based for many years on the barter of Soviet oil for Finnish goods. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> still is the Soviets' second-largest trading partner in the capitalist world after <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But its own trade dependency on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> declined as oil prices plunged.

At the same time its own economy became one of the fastest growing in the West, expanding about 5 percent a year. The two countries share a 793-mile border.

<HEAD>Task Force Urges Streamlining of Civil Court Cases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Judges and lawyers must do more to keep non-criminal cases in federal courts from taking too long and costing too much, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told Wednesday. `` The excessive cost and delay associated with litigating civil cases in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should no longer be tolerated and can be forcefully addressed through procedural reform, more active case management by judges and better efforts by attorneys and their clients,'' said a 39-page report prepared by a special task force. The report is the result of a nine-month study by 36 lawyers and law professors whose effort was suggested by Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> called the report's recommendations `` an important and encouraging start,'' and said his committee `` will give a high priority to civil justice reform.'' The report focuses on federal courts only, but the task force said its recommendations could be applied to state and local courts as well. The task force urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide `` a mix of suggestions and incentives'' to spark change, `` and then let those who use the system fill in the details.'' `` Our core recommendations allow each federal court ... to develop its own set of reforms for reducing delay and litigation costs within some broad parameters that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would establish through federal legislation,'' the report says. The task force recommended: _ That <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> require all federal trial judges to streamline the pretrial exchange of information between both sides of a lawsuit That process, called `` discovery,'' accounts for an estimated 60 percent of all federal litigation costs. _ Each trial court's streamlining plan should include a system of assigning differing `` tracks'' to cases of different complexity Fixed timetables and deadlines for completion of discovery and the start of a trial would depend on what track a case is assigned. _ Judges should adopt `` a firm and consistent policy for minimizing continuances'' or exceptions to the fixed deadlines imposed _ Clients, either in person or by telephone, should participate in any court-sponsored settlement conferences That would make it `` impossible for the attorneys to delay settlement discussions, often for weeks or months, with the time-honored excuse, ` Let me get back to you after I've discussed this with my client,''' the task force report said. _ Judges should not rely on magistrates as heavily as some now do in keeping track of civil cases that have not yet gone to trial The report also recommended increasing judges' administrative staffs and raising judges' salaries. And the report called for cooperation from the country's lawyers. `` The nation needs _ and must get _ a substantial commitment from the bar to address this challenge as well,'' it said. `` There is a consensus that some litigation costs are incurred as a direct outgrowth of the incentives that have been built into the private legal industry itself.'' The task force noted that the legal profession increasingly is dominated by escalating lawyer salaries and heavier demands for billable hours. `` The time has come for the profession to examine the impact of costs on the delivery of legal services and the critical question whether increasing costs have impeded access to the courts,'' the task force report said.

 Searchers planned to use a helicopter equipped with a heat-sensing device as the search resumed today for a 9-year-old boy missing since Sunday with his pony in rugged range country. The temperature dipped below freezing again this morning in the search area about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Chemult </LOCATION>, in central Oregon. said <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Patmon </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office About 100 searchers on horseback and 100 on foot resumed the search at daybreak, he said. Clouds and wet weather that had kept aircraft grounded most of Monday and Tuesday cleared up overnight, said <PERSON> Patmon </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter with infrared sensing equipment on board would be used sometime today, he said. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> was riding his pony, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, when he disappeared during a cattle roundup near his family's ranch Sunday afternoon. Any tracks they may have left have been erased by snow, sleet and rain. The boy's chances are waning, but searchers continued to hold out hope that he would be found alive, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s search and rescue unit said Tuesday night. `` If he's got himself into a little cave or a tree trunk or some form of shelter, it is possible to survive,'' <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> said. `` Every night he's out there, the likelihood is less, but it is very, very possible.'' Searchers have concentrated on a rugged box canyon on the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deschutes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> northwest of <LOCATION> Chemult </LOCATION>, east of the Cascade Range in south-central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The 13-square-mile canyon has been searched `` top to bottom, side to side, three times over,'' rescue chief <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I just do n't think he's in there. To be honest with you, it does n't look good.'' The boy was dressed in chaps and a rain slicker for cold, wet weather and knew what to do, his mother, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, said Tuesday. `` Thank God ... he has been trained on what to do out there in the woods. I have to trust in <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> because I know he knows what to do,'' she said. `` He may have panicked when he first realized he was lost; but after that I'm sure his common sense took over. I'm sure he is OK. He may be cold and he may be wet, but I'm sure he's OK.'' `` According to his mother, the boy and the pony have been together for a long time,'' <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> said of the 10-year-old sorrel `` The pony is very social. The pony probably would not leave the boy.''

 <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> was no ordinary tomcat. At 6 years old, he'd survived two broken jaws, innumerable fights, a fall from a fourth-story window and various internal injuries. But <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON>, like many family pets, was powerless to fight the enemy he faced at 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17. The 7.1-magnitude Bay area earthquake that took dozens of lives, injured thousands and caused more than $ 7 billion damage also claimed a large number of pets. Just like human victims, pets were trapped in falling buildings, consumed by fires and crushed in cars. But perhaps the largest numbers were swallowed by panic in a world gone temporarily haywire. Buddy and another cat, a spayed female named <PERSON> Poochie </PERSON>, lived in an apartment building partially demolished by fire the night of the quake. It has since been razed, said <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON>'s veterinarian, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` They esccaped from the burning apartment. Both cats ran outdoors. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> died. He was burned. They found his body. It's pretty ironic that he did n't make it through this because if anybody could have, it would have been him,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Poochie </PERSON> did survive. `` When her owner went back in for 15 minutes before they wrecked the building, she had come back. She -LRB- Poochie's owner -RRB- brought her in on Thursday. She smelled like smoke, but she was OK,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` What was nightmarish about the quake was, not only did we scare the bejesus out of the cats and dogs, but we lost power,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Avanzino </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. `` Disoriented animals rushing hither and yon were crossing streets with abandon, coming upon motorists who no longer had the benefit of street lights,'' <PERSON> Avanzino </PERSON> said. Several veterinarians told the story of Spot, a black, 3-year-old female cat who, like dockworker Buck Helm, defied odds to survive. Spot was sunning herself on an apartment building windowsill, <PERSON> Avanzino </PERSON> said. `` She was dislodged and fell 10 floors to the concrete. She was rushed here and came out with only a broken leg. That's one lucky cat,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> treated about 20 four-legged quake victims. `` There were some traumatic injuries. One cat was crushed under boxes. There were a lot of glass injuries,'' he said. `` The cat crushed by boxes came in pretty gorked out but he's doing better neurologically,'' he added He is sure many pets have yet to be found. No one will ever know how many dogs, cats, guinea pigs, fish, birds, reptiles and other pets were killed in the quake, he said. At least two dozen animals who bolted from their homes during the quake have been reunited with their owners by <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> and Control, said Director <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. A dozen more are being cared for by the agency. <PERSON> Avanzino </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> SPCA </ORGANIZATION> employees spent the night of the temblor in quake zones, handing out pet food, leashes, cat carriers, dishes, bowls and water, he said. Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> SPCA </ORGANIZATION> has been working to arrange for temporary homes for animals whose owners were left homeless, <PERSON> Avanzino </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harberts </PERSON>, owner of Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION>, said he had arranged for the burials of at least two dogs who died of earthquake-related injuries. The veterinarians said there were few ways to protect pets from earthquake injury or death. It's important to have carriers or ways to confine animals in an emergency, <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said. And returning to normal as quickly as possible will help an animal after a quake. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, whose patients in addition to <PERSON> Poochie </PERSON> included a dog who went through a window and cut up his nose and several cats who pulled their toenails out in struggles to get away, said the best thing owners can do is `` offer to your pets the same comfort now that they have always offered you.'' And, he added, do n't be upset if a pet hides, cowers, refuses food, pouts, mopes, vomits or wets where he or she should n't for a while. `` I've talked to about 30 people who describe psychological problems with their pets. In some cases, the people are stressed and are reading their own problems into their pets,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said.

 Tens of thousands of people poured into streets and parks of the capital today to celebrate reconstruction of the southern port of <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION>, which was almost destroyed during the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Faw has risen again, dressed in colorful clothes woven from the eyelashes of our valiant men and built upon their sweat,'' President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in the televised speech. The government has spent millions of dollars to celebrate what government newspapers called `` a miracle of construction, building a new town in only 114 days.'' Arriving in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to take part in the celebrations were <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and presidents <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. Saudi Arabian Defense Minister Prince <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> delivered a congratulatory letter from King Fahd. Official celebrations in Faw were expected later in the week, part of three days of festivities in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and the rebuilt city. <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> lies 400 yards from Iranian outposts. Before the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke out in September 1980, <PERSON> Faw </PERSON> was a dusty oil terminal town with population of about 50,000.

Hostilities ended with a cease-fire in August 1988. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> thanked other Arab countries for taking part in the celebrations and making donations for the rebuilding of the town. Schools and most government departments were closed as students lined the main highway from the airport to downtown <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, waving pictures of the arriving <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders and flags of their countries.

 Officials have ousted operators of a program providing meals to the elderly that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once praised as a national model but later was accused of mismanagement and poor service. The county Council on Aging ordered locks changed Tuesday at a recreation center where it canceled the contract under which <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> operated the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s meal program for six years. On Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> will take over the remainder of a $ 70,000 contract to feed 75 to 80 people a hot lunch each day, said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupu </PERSON>, executive director of the Council on Aging. Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s group had the contract with the state - and federally subsidized Council on Aging since 1983 She ran a food-for-the-elderly program with local funds for 13 years before that. Ms. <PERSON> Lupu </PERSON> said monitoring by the Council on Aging and an audit by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> showed `` a great number of irregularities in the way the program has been delivered to the participants.'' The Council on Aging accused Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s group of cutting meal portions and mishandling sign-in sheets that are supposed to verify that recipients get served, said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a council program monitor. In 1982, then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pointed to Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s meals program as an outstanding model of social service volunteerism at a time of federal cuts in social programs. Ms. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said her agency worked with Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s group since 1983 trying to bring it into contract compliance. She said that last year it lost the contract for home delivery of meals, in May for transportation of about 25 people to the center and on Tuesday for providing meals at the center. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, assistant director for management review at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, said the attorney general's office would determine whether criminal charges should be filed. He said, `` There is that potential; very definitely.'' <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, a community activist who identified herself as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that she, Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> and other officials of the group would have no comment. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> quoted Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> as saying she never was told directly that Council on Aging funding was being cut off and first heard about it Tuesday morning as she was on her way to the center. Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said she plans to keep helping elderly people without the funding.

 One of four <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members who killed two white teen-agers in 1974 in an effort to set off racial violence has been paroled from prison after serving 14 -LCB- years of a 199-year term. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 34, was freed Tuesday after he agreed to move to <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, where he will live with a brother and work in data processing. He agreed not to return to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> without permission of the state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. He is on parole until 2173. Relatives of <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, the two teen-agers killed in random attacks that <ORGANIZATION> BLA </ORGANIZATION> members said were launched to spark a racial war, vehemently opposed <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' release. The <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BLA </ORGANIZATION> was n't connected with a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> group of the same name. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' last two attempts for parole were rejected because of opposition from the victims' families and the judge in the case, and the commission at one point pushed <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' next parole review date to 1999. But after <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' family devised a plan for him to live in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the commission agreed to free him. `` The majority of the commission was convinced that the <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> who went to prison in troubled times is not the <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> there now,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. After <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, 18, was shot and stabbed, the group sent a tape to his mother, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON>, saying he had been `` tried, found guilty and executed'' for political crimes against blacks.

 Police scoured the city today for suspects in the abduction and shootings of a pregnant woman and her husband, whose mobile phone transmitted the sounds of sirens that directed rescuers to them. The woman died of a head wound after doctors delivered her two-months premature baby by Caesarean section. Relatives said they were told there was little hope for the infant's survival. The husband was in critical condition. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> were abducted while leaving <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital, where they'd attended a birthing class Monday night. Their abductor forced them to drive to the city's <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, then robbed and shot them. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> then used the car's cellular phone to call police, but could not give his location. When he lost consciousness, operators listened on the phone for the sirens of passing police cars. Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s baby was delivered at the hospital she'd left hours earlier. A hospital spokeswoman would say only that the baby was alive but would not comment further. The couple had chosen <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> as the baby's name because doctors had said he would be born the day after Christmas, said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON>, aunt of the 33-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>. `` If you could only see how beautifully formed he is,'' she said. `` He looked perfect. They told us to stroke his face because they said he would need a lot of love.'' `` She wanted this baby so badly. But they do n't think there's much hope for him,'' she said `` She had what she always wanted. A good job, a husband, a house, and soon a baby. And then one bastard came and took it all away,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s cousin, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 29, general manager of a fur store in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, remained in critical condition today with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> spokesman said. At a news conference today, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Saia </PERSON>, deputy police superintendent, said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s condition had kept him from assisting in the investigation. `` Hopefully he will recover and provide invaluable help to the case,'' he said. Police have no suspects but Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said fingerprints were found in the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION>' car, along with two .38 - caliber `` We now need people to come forward and provide whatever information they have, whether they saw something or heard something,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Police officers will be combing the -LRB- <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> -RRB- public housing development and talking to everyone and anyone.'' The gunman apparently thought the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION> were police officers after seeing the car phone, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON>, deputy police superintendent. Before shooting the couple, according to <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON>, the gunman said, `` I think you're five-o,'' slang for police. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> battled for himself and his wife in the minutes after they were shot and left for dead, police said. But as he spoke to police on his telephone, he faded in and out of consciousness while his pregnant wife lay dying next to him. He cried in pain and confusion. Not knowing where he was, he could n't tell state police dispatcher <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> where to send help. `` Oh man, it hurts and my wife has stopped gurgling, she's stopped breathing,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> called out, according to a transcript released Tuesday by police Then there was silence. `` Chuck, can you hear me? <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> can you hear me, buddy,'' <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> pleaded. `` Pick up the phone, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>? Come on <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>, can you hear me, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>? <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>, pick up the phone, I can hear you breathing there <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>, come on, buddy.'' Still, nothing. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> instructed <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> at one point to open his door or window to see if he could identify some landmark, so that help could find him. But <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> only replied: `` I'm blanking out.'' `` You ca n't blank out on me, I need you man. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>? <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>?'' In a desperate effort to home in on the car, police in cruisers were told to flick their sirens off and on, one by one. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> was able to tell which cruiser was near the Stuarts' car by listening to the sirens coming over the phone. `` Get my wife out,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> told the officers who found him. The ambulance crew that cae to the aid of the Stuarts had been riding with a camera crew from the CBS-TV series `` Rescue 911,'' which tells real-life stories about rescue operations. The crew videotaped <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> regaining consciousness and talking about the attack as paramedics worked on him en route to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, and was allowed into the emergency room, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The mayor asked that every available detective be put on the case, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. At a news conference, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> was asked why the killing was getting so much attention when shootings occur almost daily in other distressed areas of the city. `` No matter whether it happens in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, whatever area or color or ethnicity, it will be handled in the same aggressive and fair way by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' he replied. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakas </PERSON>, an owner of the fur store where <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> has worked for eight years, said couple had just celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary. The child was the couple's first. The couple, from suburban Reading, were mindful of the rise of violence in the city, friends said. `` <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> and I had talked about the number of shootings that had gone on there,'' said fellow employee <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworski </PERSON>. `` It seemed almost daily, the number of people getting shot. `` So many senseless things going on,'' <PERSON> Jaworski </PERSON> said, choking on his words.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, head bowed and bound hand and foot, was led into federal prison to begin a 45-year sentence for defrauding thousands of followers of his television ministry. `` My reports are he's going through the process very normally,'' Warden <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday. After surrendering his valuables, showering, leaving his fingerprints and donning prison garb, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> entered the cell he will share with `` another lightweight security inmate,'' <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> said. After his arrival, the founder of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> kept his eyes on the ground as six guards hustled him from a brown sedan to the entrance of the rural, medium-security prison in east <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Officials said he would stay here for about two weeks before transfer to another prison. `` Obviously, he is not a normal inmate, but he is being processed as a normal inmate,'' <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> said. Two former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aides sentenced a month ago to more than 17 years each after being convicted of income tax evasion reported to an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> prison today. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggert </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, arrived at the minimum-security prison at <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had no comment for the dozens of reporters gathered at the red-brick prison surrounded by two 15-foot fences topped with razor wire. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who sentenced <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> on Tuesday, also fined him $ 500,000. Saying that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was unrepentant and still trying to milk supporters for money, he ordered him to begin serving the long sentence immediately. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would have to serve at least 10 years in prison before achieving parole unless a planned appeal is successful. <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was allowed to contact his family before being placed in his two-man cell for the night. The warden said he had no details on what calls <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> made. <PERSON> Baksides </PERSON> had an agreement not to reveal the nature of the sanctions. `` I could only confirm what the Turkish spokesman said today,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee approved the measure despite a full-scale lobbying campaign by the Turkish government against it. The government has taken the sanctions to put pressure on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to make efforts to block the adoption of the resolution by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said a government official speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the defense cooperation pact between <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be jeopardized when it comes up for renewal next year if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approves the measure. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains its military installations in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> under this defense pact. No date has been set for full consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 A judge sent evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> directly to jail to start a 45-year sentence for defrauding followers of millions of dollars, saying people were `` sick of being saps for money-grubbing preachers.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> on Tuesday also fined the defrocked <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder $ 500,000, concluding that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had continued to milk the faithful even after his conviction for overselling memberships in a Christian vacation retreat. The 49-year-old television evangelist left the courtroom in leg irons and handcuffs on his way to federal prison in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Depending on the outcome of an appeal, he will serve at least 10 years before being eligible for parole. Two of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former aides reported today to another, minimum-security prison in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> to begin serving sentences they received a month ago _ more than 18 years for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> and 17 for his brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON>. Prosecutors said the man who founded the once mighty <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> religious empire raised thousands of dollars since his Oct. 5th conviction and needed to be imprisoned to stop him from using TV and the mails to raise more. `` He's able to walk out of this courtroom today and continue to perpetuate this fraud,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told the judge. `` He has n't blinked.'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> read a letter that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, mailed last month from their new TV ministry in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, asking 300 supporters to send in $ 1,000 apiece to alleviate a financial crisis. `` Those of us who do have a religion are sick of being saps for money-grubbing preachers and priests,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. `` Worst of all, it appears that Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> feels he was deserving of his gains from the little people who sent in their savings.'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> refrained from ordering <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to make restitution to his victims, saying that issue needed to be resolved in bankruptcy court. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fall from power began in 1987 with revelations about a sexual encounter with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, who received hush money, leading to the unraveling of the ministry. `` I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said before sentencing. `` I have sinned. But never in my life did I intend to defraud anyone.'' Prosecutors did n't accept his apology. `` This man is a con man, a common criminal,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` He's ready, willing and able to pick it up where he left it off. He's ready to go back to the henhouse.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stood and stared straight ahead as the sentence was read. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> then sent him to the medium-security federal prison at <LOCATION> Talledega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where he arrived late Tuesday. Warden <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was to spend the night in a cell with another inmate, and remain there a few weeks before being assigned to another institution. Defense attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> had asked that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> be freed on bond pending an appeal. But <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said he posed a substantial flight risk. `` He has supporters who think he can do no wrong and who say they are willing to do anything for him,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. `` I believe them.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s 19-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, was led sobbing from the courtroom. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> did not attend the trial. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was convicted of 23 counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy in an indictment that charged him with diverting $ 3.7 million in ministry finances to finance his lavish lifestyle out of the $ 158 million sent him by followers. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had faced a maximum sentence of 120 years, but the judge consolidated the 24 counts to nine and sentenced <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to five years on each. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, known as `` Maximum <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>,'' had given stiff sentences in the convictions of three top <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aides, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> brothers. The three cooperated with the government in exchange for lightened sentences. Nearly 153,000 people sent money to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> between 1984 and 1987 to become `` lifetime partners'' at the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> retreat in nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was convicted of selling guarantees of lodging at the retreat when he knew rooms were n't available He spent contributors' money on luxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry, vacations, an air-conditioned doghouse, a swimming pool heated to 90 degrees, and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s six-week trial was delayed for three days in September when he suffered an emotional collapse, claiming that wild animals were attacking him. Hurricane Hugo caused a one-day delay. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 after it was revealed that he had paid <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> $ 265,000 in ministry money to keep quiet about their 1980 tryst. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> applauded Tuesday's sentence. `` It can not repay those millions of dollars, and the years of work people did to make it, but at least it's a start,'' she said in a telephone interview from her <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home. `` At least people can feel like they wo n't be taken for fools.'' `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s no crook,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. `` The news media made him look like one.''

 Some 200 earthquake victims still are missing, but no army of rescuers is desperately pawing through rubble to find them. Those 200 _ and more than 400 other snakes and lizards _ escaped from their cages Oct. 17 when the 7.1 quake smashed glass and overturned enclosures where the cold-blooded reptiles lived at the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vivarium </LOCATION>. `` We had flashlights. The floor was covered with baby snakes,'' said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, Vivarium manager. `` We just grabbed them up and threw them into a huge garbage bucket.'' The Vivarium, home to 10,000 lizards, snakes, amphibians and rodents, is about 50 feet from the quake-ruined section of Interstate 880. Employees ran to help the human victims; when they returned, they discovered the successful break-out. `` I hope this building is secure, I hope they're not making it into theneighborhood. But we've torn this place from top to bottom looking for them,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maercks </PERSON>, one of three owners of the 19-year-old business, said Tuesday. All the escapees are non-poisonous. They include several $ 500 foot-long dumeril boa constrictors, three $ 600 monitor lizards and assorted reptiles, worth $ 35 to $ 500 each. `` You name it, they hid there,'' said <PERSON> Maercks </PERSON>. `` We found them behind pictures on the wall, hanging from the picture wires. We found them under cages, on top of cages. At one point I changed from tennis shoes to boots. When I went back to put my tennis shoes on I found a snake in each shoe.''

 Cocaine-producing and consuming nations wrapped up a two-day meeting Wednesday, agreeing to tighten their dragnet on drug traffickers and encourage coca farmers to plant other cash crops. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and other European countries that have seen a dramatic expansion in the drug trade in recent years pledged greater involvement. `` This meeting represents a great step forward in broad-based, material support by the major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries,'' said Acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, adding: `` It would not be helpful to elaborate on the specifics of material offered.'' He said the group also agreed to work toward streamlining the extradition process and establish a network of treaties `` that will eliminate any hiding place in the world'' for drug traffickers. The meeting brought representatives of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> together for the first time to discuss material and legal methods to halt the flow of cocaine. In the past three years the amount of cocaine seized in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has tripled as drug traffickers turn from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in search of new markets. An official said cocaine seizures in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> last year represented 62 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> total of about six tons, and that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is another major point of entry into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We feel that the recognition -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries -RRB- of our situation represents a rather big step forward,'' said <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Lecaroz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s special drug ambassador. Spanish Interior Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcuera </PERSON> said the group agreed on the importance of investigating and halting the laundering of drug money and would look into ways to control the export from <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries of chemicals used to transform coca leave paste into cocaine. On Tuesday at the close of a Hispano-French summit in the Spanish city of <LOCATION> Valladolid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> called for a crackdown on money-laundering and said banks `` will have to open up their books and their accounts.'' Most of the world's coca leaves are grown in the Andean highlands of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Most of the coca leave paste is processed into cocaine and shipped to the rest of the world from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Representatives of all three producer countries stressed the importance of crop substitution programs to wean growers away from coca as well as export incentives and financing to make substitute crops commercially attractive. Participants agreed in a final communique to draw up and secure funding for appropriate crop substitution programs. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s special drug coordinator <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solans </PERSON> said concrete aid in the form of vehicles, training of police and narcotics agents, weapons and judicial protection programs would be negotiated bilaterally.

 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to leave a great legacy of its `` golden age'' to history by helping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other communist countries achieve freedom and democracy. `` This is a golden age for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told some 600 people attending a banquet in his honor. `` A genuine golden age provides the world with a distinctive idea, a philosophy, a cause, a greater good. `` So what will be <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s legacy?'' he asked. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in promoting freedom and democracy, particularly in communist countries moving toward democracy. `` Great endeavors make great nations. Let <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> undertake this great endeavor to help save <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I know you will,'' he said. In a television interview earlier in the day, the 78-year-old former president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are good friends who have made significant progress in their sometimes rocky trade relations. `` There are just a few little itchy things here and there that we still are working on from both sides, and part of our problem is our own <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that we have to bring into line,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year totaled $ 52 billion, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he believes <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s recent purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.4 billion was welcome in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I just have the feeling that maybe <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> needs some outsiders to bring back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that are being made,'' the former movie star said. The interview was with the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest media conglomerate and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s host during his nine-day, $ 7 million visit.

<TEXT>
 The House today sustained President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a bill that would have allowed federally financed Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest The vote was 231 to 191 in favor of override, but that fell 51 votes short of the two-thirds margin needed. Abortion-rights supporters, who had won a surprising victory two weeks ago for more liberal abortion provisions, failed in today's vote to end a prohibition that has been written in federal law for nearly a decade Supporters of expanding federally financed abortions for poor women had acknowledged they faced a difficult task in trying to raise a two-thirds <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority for an override. They won a 216-206 vote two weeks ago. An override also would have require two-thirds approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The vote followed an emotion-packed debate on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, in which abortion-rights forces condemned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto as an unconscionable infringement on the rights of poor women and children victimized by rape and incest _ and one that will bring political damage to Republicans. Abortion foes cast the issue as a moral one that would invite widespread federal financing of abortions. `` This president ca n't stop -LRB- <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He ca n't decide what to do to roll back communism ... But boy, can he show the poor women of this country who's boss,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., a leader of abortion-rights lawmakers `` If you're a poor woman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is saying to you, ` Just say no to rape; Just say no to incest.' What a leader,'' <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, a leader of the anti-abortion forces, said the measure was `` vague, imprecise, and if enacted into law might open the floodgates to aboriton funding.'' Another abortion foe, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said, `` I have letters here from women who have been raped who say, ` Thank God I did n't have an abortion.' In an indication of how politically difficult the issue was regarded, the House Republican leader, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said he would vote with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> while suggesting he could change positions later `` I'm obliged obviously as the leader to support the president in this effort,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` That is n't to say that sometime down the road that position wo n't be modified to some degree, but I think we ought to talk about it.'' The liberalized abortion language passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 216-206 vote two weeks ago. The measure, which cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a wider margin, is part of a $ 156.7 billion appropriations bill for education, labor and health programs. One Democrat who had voted against the liberalization told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> today he would change positions and vote to overrride. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that wrote the spending bill, said `` I like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ... But Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>, he's wrong this time.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was seeking `` room for flexibility'' on the issue immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. But under pressure from anti-abortion supporters he hardened his stand and vetoed the bill Saturday. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today the passage of tougher restrictions on abortion by the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday `` certainly does show that there's strong feelings on both sides of this issue.'' He said the president has no plans to campaign for passage of state laws restricting abortion. On Tuesday, freshman Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, reversed his previous stand and said he would vote in favor of an override. `` I think it's wrong for me as a congressman to dictate to women ... what decision they should make in the case of rape and incest,'' said <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON>, who added he remains personally opposed to abortion. The abortion provision would reverse a law in effect since 1981 that bans all Medicaid abortions for poor women except when the mother's life is endangered by her pregnancy. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has endorsed more liberal abortion provisions, the House in previous years insisted on keeping the current law. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote two weeks ago to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version surprised even its supporters. The disputed provision would allow Medicaid funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest, when the victim `` reported promptly'' to health or law authorities. Although that was expected to cover a relatively narrow category of women, the issue has taken on broader symbolic importance in the political fight over abortion. It comes at a time when abortion rights supporters say they are benefiting from a changed political climate after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last summer gave the states more room to regulate abortions. That ruling, they contend, has energized abortion rights supporters and made voters more wary of efforts to impose new restrictions.

 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> today named <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a longtime mediator and onetime labor secretary himself, as `` supermediator'' for the 6-month-old strike by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe that <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> is precisely the right person to assist the parties in resolving what has, thus far, been a most difficult dispute,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters in making the announcement. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, who agreed Tuesday to try to settle the strike by 1,700 miners in three states, said the public acrimony between the union and company gave him pause before he decided to accept. `` This is one that you did n't jump at so quick,'' <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said. Still, <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said he would contact both sides immediately and that he hoped to resolve the strike before the upcoming holidays. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said he would meet separately with company and union officials first but wanted them to agree to a face-to-face meeting soon. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, labor secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration, has an impressive record of settling strikes. Since leaving government, he has headed a labor relations company in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. His skills will be tested in the UMW-Pittston dispute. The two sides refuse to negotiate face-to-face and have been shuttling messages through federal mediators. The strike began April 5 at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> mines in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. The major dispute is over health and retirement benefits. Two weeks ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> met with strikers in <LOCATION> Carbo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and days later sat down with <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. After that meeting, she said she would name a supermediator. As labor secretary, <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> sometimes stepped into contract disputes but Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has resisted doing so. `` I am not a mediator,'' she said during her visit to the Pittston facility. `` I'm not here to say I have the answer to this complex problem. But I do feel now it is time to see if we can facilitate the bargaining process.'' <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>'s resume includes helping end a six-month strike by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and a three-week strike by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> teachers in 1983. He also helped settle a professional football strike in 1974 and has mediated dozens of disputes in the rubber, auto, electric, hotel and transportation industries. President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> brought the <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, native to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1969, naming him assistant secretary of labor. He was credited with helping settle railroad and airline labor disputes. In 1973, he was named director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, serving for three years until <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> tapped him to head the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 A nine-block residential area was strewn with smoldering debris today after a series of explosions destroyed three homes, killing two people and injuring 13 others. `` It's like a war zone. There's a lot of damage,'' Conneaut Mayor <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiley </PERSON> said after surveying the neighborhood. A dozen agents from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> were to search the rubble later today for clues of the explosion, <ORGANIZATION> Shiley </ORGANIZATION> said. The mayor said it was presumed there were no more deaths. Officials earlier feared more victims might be in the wreckage. `` It's pretty much out. There's still some smoldering,'' <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Arcaro </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION> building inspector, said of the fire that broke out after the series of explosions about noon Tuesday. Fire Chief <PERSON> Bim </PERSON> <PERSON> Orrenmaa </PERSON> said officials were investigating the possibility that the 20 minutes of explosions, of which the largest occurred midway through the series, may have been caused by illegal fireworks. `` I thought it was an earthquake,'' said <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Punkar </PERSON>, who lives three blocks away in this town of 13,000 people just west of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> state line. `` This felt like someone hit the house,'' she said. `` Like a semi hit the house. All the neighbors ran out in the street saying, ` What was it?''' W.A. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said the blast rocked his house two miles away. `` We were eating lunch and it shook the floor. I had no idea what it was.'' <PERSON> Orrenmaa </PERSON> said he saw what appeared to be firecrackers strewn around the house where the largest explosion occurred. Investigators had not yet determined whether all of the explosions occurred at the same house. The fire chief said the pattern of the blasts led him to suspect illegal fireworks were involved and he summoned federal agents to investigate. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsolver </PERSON>, a special agent with the federal bureau's <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> office, also said items that resembled firecracker tubes had been spotted at one house He said federal investigators were warned of the possibility of more blasts while they examine the debris. The county coroner's office tentatively identified the two dead as people who lived in the area of the blast: <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, 56, and <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON>, described as elderly. The only injured person to be hospitalized, <PERSON> Georgianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, 46, was listed in satisfactory condition this morning at <ORGANIZATION> Hamot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION>. She lived in the house where the largest explosion occurred. Twelve people were treated at <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION> and released, said hospital administrator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Orrenmaa </PERSON> originally put the death toll at three, but later revised it to two.

 Eleven people were slightly injured Wednesday when a boat bumped into <LOCATION> Southwark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> near the site of a fatal accident involving a pleasure boat in August, police said.

 An American facing charges of selling secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had applied for Soviet citizenship last month but was denied, a government spokesman said Wednesday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, who is accused of delivering unauthorized information to Soviet agents, requested citizenship when he was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as a tourist in September, said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today overwhelmingly passed a $ 3.45 billion relief package for earthquake-damaged <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> which substantially expands aid approved by the House. By a vote of 97-1, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the plan and sent it back to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as part of a wide-ranging spending bill which must reach President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk tonight to keep the federal government from defaulting. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, cast the only negative vote. Not voting were Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, D-R The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> accepted the House-passed $ 2.85 billion earthquake allocation and, responding to pleas from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawmakers, added to it $ 600 million more for <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> emergency loans. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will be eligible to receive immediately $ 3.45 billion,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` It is very likely that the ultimate federal cost for the disaster may be higher ... for a community that has been badly shaken. `` People who are dislocated from their homes and businesses need that assistance now,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., who called the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action `` generous and sensitive. `` You have to go for what you can and we've done that,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., who led his delegation's unsuccessful effort in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for even more money _ $ 3.8 billion The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure, passed 321-99 on Tuesday, included $ 500 million for the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> repair efforts and $ 1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency fund. It also set up a $ 250 million fund for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to spend at his discretion. In addition to expanding the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> money, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved waivers of federal rules, denied in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, that would let the state get more federal money quickly with less commitment of local and state funds. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> estimated the total cost of the damage to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area from the Oct. 17 earthquake exceeded $ 7 billion. Quick Senate action was needed because the aid was attached to a stopgap spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown Thursday. The bill is required because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president have failed to enact 11 of the 13 annual appropriations bills required for the government to operate in fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. A top <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership aide said he expected a modest expansion in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be acceptable in that chamber. Both houses must agree on a single version before it can be sent to the president. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday the president could accept the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of the assistance plan. The administration had proposed $ 1.5 billion in new federal spending, plus earmarking another $ 1 billion for quake relief. Because of the urgency of the situation, the Californians said they were seeking as much as they could get now, while the quake is still fresh on the nation's consciousness, but would come back for more later. `` Let me be honest,'' <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> said. `` If we do n't accomplish everything we set out to accomplish, we'll have to come back again and again and again ... -LRB- but -RRB- we understand that in six months we'll be just another budgetary problem.'' The allocation for the quake approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was already several times larger than any previous disaster aid package. Because of the extent of the damage, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would waive or greatly expand legal limits to the federal obligation. For example, one waiver would allow the federal government to pay for repairing the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, a vital link that is a toll road and thus not eligible for such aid. The plan also would extend from 90 days to 180 days the period during which the state could get 100 percent federal reimbursement for road repairs. And the cost of earthquake repairs would be kept separate from the state's normal allocation from the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, so it would not slow road projects elsewhere in the state.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is moving ahead with a program that will offer lower flood insurance rates in communities that work harder to reduce risks of flood damage, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duryee </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency is setting a Dec. 15, 1990, deadline for initial applications from communities seeking to qualify for premium adjustments under the program, called the Community Rating System. The first flood insurance rate cuts will take effect Oct. 1, 1991, in communities that qualify for them, he said. <PERSON> Duryee </PERSON> said the agency also is trying to simplify procedures involved with the flood insurance program, noting criticism in some communities that `` the program was so complex that people did n't want to fuss with all that was necessary to get coverage. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FIA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy administrator, said about 2,000 out of the nearly 18,000 communities now participating in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> will apply for premium reductions under the new rating system. Currently, there are more than 2.1 million federal flood insurance policies in force. Over the last 10 years, 350,000 insurance losses have been paid out for a total of $ 2.5 billion. An <ORGANIZATION> FIA </ORGANIZATION> summary of the Community Rating System said its goals are to `` are to encourage, by the use of flood insurance premium adjustments, community and state activities beyond those required by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> to reduce flood losses, facilitate accurate insurance rating and promote the awareness of flood insurance.'' `` Not only does such a system properly reward those communities that are doing more than the minimum to protect their residents from flood losses, it will will encourage communities to initiate new flood protection activities,'' the paper said.

<HEAD>Former Contra Says American Money Used To Buy Votes, Causes Corruption</HEAD>

 A disgruntled former Contra leader lashed out Wednesday at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financing for the opposition political coalition in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, charging the money is going for vote-buying and will cause `` corruption on a big scale.'' <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, who describes himself as the CIA-selected director of Contra communications from 1982 to 1984, said the $ 9 million in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> funds equals $ 2 billion in his poor, Central American country. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration last week received congressional approval for the aid to help the coalition in its February electoral fight against the leftist Sandinista government. `` The congressional vote for this form of intervention represents an essential agreement between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the attempt to overturn the Sandinista government by armed force has failed,'' he said at a news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the Contra rebels in 1988. The 10,000 or so troops, most of whom are based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, receive non-lethal aid. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> also charged that presidential candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, who is not related to him, received the nomination because of vote-buying. `` People received money to get her elected,'' he said. `` I have heard this directly from friends and witnesses.'' He offered no other proof or testimony. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> also charged that opposition leaders planned to use more than $ 2.5 million in American funds for salaries, cars and paid vacations. `` These are merely the current, overt funds,'' <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said. An <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a draft budget had been presented by the opposition coalition, but no decisions had been reached. `` It will be closely monitored,'' he said. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> still supplies the opposition working out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. He said Contra combatants continued `` carrying out armed propaganda activities, murdering electoral officials and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> political activists and warning peasants against voting for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> says he is a `` non-Sandinista Nicaraguan'' but faulted the government only for not cracking down on the large sums of money coming into the country for the elections, $ 2 million of which goes to the government's electoral council. `` I think <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was wrong in accepting that money,'' he said. `` This is corruption on a big scale.'' <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> returned to live in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1987 and he now heads the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> office of the Center for the Study of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, a group he said will `` observe the observers'' in the Nicaraguan elections. That organization is an offshoot of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, made up mostly of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> opposed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contra rebels.

 The state Civil Rights Division is investigating incidents at a high school that prompted transfer requests from a black teacher and three black students. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> and other civil-rights agencies plan to visit <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> next week, division public information officer <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fester </PERSON> said Tuesday. Evergreen language arts teacher <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> submitted a transfer request to the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> last Friday after receiving an unsigned note containing a racist threat. The note `` was very physically threatening,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, 35, said Tuesday. `` Life. Death. That sort of thing. ... I simply ca n't work in fear, and I wo n't.'' Knight is on paid administrative leave while his transfer request is considered. Several weeks ago, three black students, the sons of Evergreen residents Norm and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>, withdrew from the school after hearing that some students rigged a homecoming contest against them because they are black. Their mother resigned as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Parent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The students said that earlier racist graffiti and slurs against blacks and <PERSON> Jews </PERSON> contributed to their decision to leave the school. Principal <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said he believes the incidents are the work of a handful of white supremacist students. He added that there is growing anger among the school's 1,100 students, who generally view publicity about the incidents as marring their school's reputation. Parents in the mountain community west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> feel the same way. `` I've been getting a lot of phone calls,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. `` Parents are very upset and angry that <PERSON> Evergreen </PERSON> is being labeled as racist.'' Under <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 1988 ethnic intimidation law, the note writer could be charged with a misdemeanor. <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> said, however, that no police report had been filed

 Fifteen Japanese-Americans whose graduation from high school was thwarted by World War II will receive diplomas they earned 47 years ago. The students, who are scheduled to receive their diplomas Saturday, were among those detained in the since-discredited wartime policy of relocating Japanese-Americans to internment camps as possible enemy sympathizers. `` Our rights were denied us all these years,'' said <PERSON> Hayao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shishino </PERSON>, a retired cook who lives in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>. `` We want to be on the rolls of the Class of 1942.'' Most of the high school seniors sent to internment camps went on to receive diplomas from correspondence courses or at their 25th anniversary class reunion in 1967. But <PERSON> Shishino </PERSON> and other former students wanted diplomas dated 1942. He successfully appealed to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> school board member <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Furutani </PERSON>, whose mother-in-law was among the classmates refused diplomas. `` The most important part of this episode is that it is a living history lesson.

<TEXT>
 Despite calls for less state regulation and more power for schools to improve themselves, most states are still calling the shots on education reform, according to a new report. States have made only modest educational gains since the 1983 federal report `` A Nation at Risk'' ushered in the reform era with its verdict that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools were mired in mediocrity, according to the report, `` The Progress of Reform: An Appraisal of State Education Initiatives.'' The report released Wednesday concluded that state reform packages generally `` lacked coherence,'' and only a few states such as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> have programs aimed at encouraging local districts to find creative ways of improving classroom instruction. Current rhetoric holds that the reform movement went through a `` first wave'' from 1982-86, mostly dictated from on high by states, during which teacher and student standards were stiffened. From 1986 on, a `` second wave'' of reform, often called `` restructuring,'' is said to have moved beyond standards to improving teaching and learning at the school site. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at his `` education summit'' with the nation's governors last month put his stamp of approval on this `` second wave,'' endorsing the principles of less educational red tape and more power for teachers and others at school sites to meet reform mandates But the study concludes that this second wave of reform remains wishful thinking in most states. Future objectives such as redistributing education funds from rich to poor districts and giving teachers and parents more authority will be far tougher, if not impossible, to achieve. `` If we're going to get those kinds of things, people are going to have to be willing to stay at it for a long time,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>, associate professor of education at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and co-author of the report said in a telephone interview Wednesday. A few pioneering districts such as <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, have active local restructuring strategies, but `` states are still enacting policies more characteristie globe that you will also be known as the international education president.''

<TEXT>
 A stamp fraud ring that has cost the post office $ 16 million may have been broken in a series of raids Wednesday, investigators said. The alleged fraud involved the resale of canceled stamps after the postmark had been removed chemically and the stamps re-gummed, said a post office spokesman. Several people were being questioned following raids across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by police and 75 postal investigators, the spokesman said. Billions of stamps were reportedly seized, many of which had been sent unwittingly to the fraud ring by charities, the spokesman said. The charities believed they were sending the stamps to dealers who repackage them for sale to collectors, the spokesman said. The post office said it was alerted to a possible fraud a year ago when revenue from stamps did n't tally with the volume of mail. The alleged plot involved outsiders, not post office employees, the spokesman said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared today that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> poses `` an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' and announced he will continue the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embargo against the Central American country. The trade embargo against the nation of 3 million was imposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on May 1, 1985. It bars imports from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and bans <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to that country except to support the Contra rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government. It also prohibits Nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In related developments, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> protested as recently as today to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about continued shipments of East-bloc arms from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, briefing reporters on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s upcoming trip to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, also said the president would not meet with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> this weekend during a celebration of a century of democracy in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` I doubt that he would refuse to speak if spoken to, but he's not going to be meeting with him, and not going to be extending any courtesies,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> He also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was likely to use the gathering in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, to be attended by 19 heads of state, to further `` keep up the pressure'' for the ouster of Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power and to talk about the war on drugs. The secretary said the administration continues to have concern that in the upcoming Nicaraguan elections, `` the opposition parties there will not be given adequate and sufficient access to the media to make the election free and fair.'' `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> clearly continues to ship arms'' to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, citing `` the fact that a truck was stopped here at the Hunduran border a day or so ago that had East-bloc arms in it.'' `` It is a major problem that we have called to the attention of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and called to their attention as recently as today,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has denied any role in such arms shipments. `` We've had an extended dialogue with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about the importance of using their influence to stop that kind of activity,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added. `` The Soviets told us they are going to use their best efforts to do that.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he was willing to give the Soviets the benefit of the doubt, since Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had recently been in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` It would appear to me the Nicaraguans are telling them one thing and doing something else,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said a prerequisite for such a meeting was for <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to first meet with `` the Nicaraguan resistance,'' the contras who have been supported by both the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations. `` We think he ought to meet with his own people before he meets with us,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` He has continued to refuse to do that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a six-month report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the status of the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> embargo, said `` the trade sanctions are an essential element of our policy that seeks a democratic outcome in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by diplomatic means.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to see <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government voted out of office in the election next Feb. 25, and contends that election preparations unfairly benefit the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` The policies and actions of the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I do not believe that current conditions in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> justify lifting the trade sanctions,'' he wrote. He added that if <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> holds fair elections and implements democratic reforms, as he promised in a regional agreement with other Central American presidents, `` the emergency that prompted the imposition of the trade sanctions would largely be resolved.''

<TEXT>
 Lawmakers from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> set aside their agenda Wednesday and traded accusations of dictatorship and human rights abuses, casting doubt on any quick breakthrough toward easing tension. Delegates from the two sides clashed when communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> opened the talks at this truce village by demanding <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> release three jailed dissidents and get all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to withdraw. Chief South Korean delegate <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> Mun-shick </PERSON> responded by saying <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> should stop interfering in the south's internal affairs and said the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government `` must abandon dictatorial rule and protect human rights.'' The senior North Korean delegate, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, reacted angrily: `` Your accusations are nonsense.'' After reading prepared statements repeating their uncompromising stands, both sides traded unusually hostile accusations for more than three hours, but agreed to meet again Nov. 29. Wednesday's meeting, the first since December, was called to set terms for a joint session of the two Koreas' legislatures to work out various tension-easing measures on the peninsula, including a non-aggression pact. The nations clashed over similar subjects at <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, sports and other talks earlier this month but their exchanges were not as hostile as Wednesday. The chief North Korean delegate, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, argued that the three jailed South Korean dissidents _ <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> pastor <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, opposition lawmaker <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON> and radical student Im Su-kyong _ were `` patriots who wanted reunification of the divided peninsula'' and demanded their immediate release. The three dissidents were arrested between April and August for making illegal trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, an enemy country. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government bans unauthorized visits to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and maintains dialogue on national unification must be carried on only through official channels. The two Koreas do not allow their citizens to visit each other or cross the heavily guarded border. The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and the capitalist south in 1945 at the end of World War II and the two nations remain bitter enemies after fighting a bloody war from 1950-53.

 Recovery advanced into its second week today for an earthquake-rattled region feeling an aftershock of numbers _ a stronger <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> reading, a 50-50 chance of a new jolt and an infusion of relief money. Eight people remained missing, and the death toll from the Oct. 17 temblor climbed to 63 with a coroner's discovery of a 39th victim from double-decked Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> reported today that 13,892 people have been left homeless, nearly double the previous figure. The first damage claim against the state was filed by two motorists injured in the collapse. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today approved a $ 3.45 billion quake relief package. It expands a $ 2.85 billion House-approved measure by adding $ 600 million for <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> emergency loans. The legislation now goes back to the House. Damage estimates have been set at $ 7.1 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. `` We were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive power of World War II, including the atomic bomb,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s hard-hit <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> got a $ 356,460 check from state Controller <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on Tuesday. The check is 75 percent of the money the county already has spent on earthquake response. Church bells tolled at 5:04 p.m., one week to the minute after the quake. It packed more punch than first thought, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, which upped the magnitude to 7.1 from 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale after checking 18 seismic stations around the world. The homeless figure climbed after rain forced many into shelters, where county officials are compiling counts of those displaced, according to <ORGANIZATION> OES </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>. A geologist warned that because of the recent rain, huge sections of land in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> cracked by earthquake fissures are in danger of sliding this winter and burying hundreds of homes. `` What's happening today is frightening to geologists who have looked at it,'' Professor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, told county supervisors Tuesday. `` I think there's a cause for alarm, but not instant alarm until we've had more rain.'' Jumpy residents also were told that there is a 50-50 chance of a 5.0 aftershock during the next two months, and there is an 11 percent shot of a 6.0 shock. A 5.0 <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> reading can cause considerable damage; 6.0 can be severe, especially to buildings already weakened. An aftershock of 4.5 was registered at 6:27 p.m. Tuesday, the latest of about 3,500 aftershocks since Oct. 17. `` I'm still shook up. Every time I hear a noise I jump,'' said <PERSON> Ela </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, owner of a soul food cafe near I-880. And for all the death and destruction, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> celebrated her first week of life. She was born at 5:03 p.m. on Oct. 17 by Ceasarean section, and doctors shielded her mother by leaning over the incision. `` You were born and the earth moved,'' said her father, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who was at his wife's side in the delivery room of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, crews were taking down sections of I-880. They fear that still-standing sections of the state's first elevated freeway could topple like dominoes onto the 1 \ - mile stretch Four sections remain inaccessible, and the search for more bodies was delayed until at least Thursday because the road is too shaky. Authorities have abandoned hope of finding anyone alive in the rubble. <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police, who had said Tuesday that nine people remained unaccounted for, revised the number to eight today but could give no explanation for the change. Officials said 135 people evacuated from homes near the highway Sunday may be allowed to return to their homes by Thursday. In the damage claims, which could lead to a lawsuit, <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> residents <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Askia </PERSON> <PERSON> Y.M </PERSON>. Hurts, who were returning from a plumbing job in <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s car on the freeway, asked the state to pay unspecified medical damages. Workers, meanwhile, removed the section of the lower deck of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> on Tuesday. It will take at least a month to rebuild the five-lane, 50-foot pieces. The hole in the 53-year-old bridge is as gaping as the hole in the area's transportation system Without the bridge and key sections of devastated highways, transit officials have jury-rigged a jammed commuter system with extra trains, ferries and other alternatives. Inconvenienced commuters abandoned their cars and took to public transportation in record numbers. The Bay Area Rapid Transit by 9 a.m. Tuesday set a weekday ridership record with 99,135, 4,300 more than the previous day. Meanwhile, 300 men found shelter and plentiful chow on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessel built to deploy assault troops by helicopter. Most of the men, part of the city's permanent homeless population, were staying at the Moscone Convention Center but were shipped to the USS Peleliu to make room a convention of plastic surgeons. `` We're getting steaks, roast beef, ham end eggs, vegetables and snacks all day _ and regular showers _ the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s doin' a good job,'' declared <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clulow </PERSON> on the carrier's cavernous hangar deck. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> called on the federal government to raise the maximum home rebuilding loan to $ 500,000 from $ 100,000 because of the high housing costs in the region. `` One-hundred thousand dollars in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> can make a big difference. It does n't here,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive repair, <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. Damage in the city could reach $ 3.2 billion, he said. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Walthall </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, said the utility may have to replace about 10 miles of gas distribution lines in the hard-hit <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district. The cost: $ 10 million. About 5,100 customers are without gas service in the district, and about 1,000 customers are also without electricity, <PERSON> Walthall </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> offered today to review his proposal for talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> but said overhauling it could delay negotiations. `` We think the five points are reasonable. We think the five points are clear,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news conference, referring to the major provisions of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal. Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> delivered Monday night, accepted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> package in principle _ provided his government was assured the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> would be excluded and that the talks would deal entirely with holding elections on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. `` I think that we want to do everything we can to try and move things forward,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` And therefore we will review the suggested changes we have received.'' However, he added, `` if we start making changes for one side we will find ourselves in an extended negotiating session in terms of making changes that might be requested. ... It would be much better if both sides would accept the five points as a general framework for moving forward and then let's get about the hard, nitty-gritty business of sitting down face-to-face and deciding what the rules are that would govern the conduct of elections.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> described his mood as realistic _ neither optimisic nor pessimistic _ after reading <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> letter and talking to him Tuesday on the telephone. But he went on to say: `` Over the last week or so many people have wanted to, basically, write this effort off. They wanted to declare it dead. The events of the last two or three days at least indicate that the effort has life in it.'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in the letter delivered by Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> on Monday night that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must be excluded and the agenda limited to the mechanics of conducting elections among the 1.4 million Palestinians who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had already offered assurances he was not trying to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would have the right to determine beforehand if it was `` satisfied'' with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to harden those assurances, while <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is trying to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> through Egyptian intermediaries to permit Palestinians in the Israeli-held territories to engage in negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Without a green light from <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization, it is extremely unlikely Palestinians will step forward. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, in a letter last week to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said they were being subjected to `` intimidation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, meeting last week in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, insisted that only the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had the authority to represent Palestinians and to select the delegation. But <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Tuesday that did not mean the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had rejected <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s initiative. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> talked again to <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> on Tuesday, reaching him by telephone in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> where the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign minister is meeting with Belgian and European Common Market officials as well as with a group of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassadors based in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The contents of their conversation were not disclosed. But it was learned <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> concluded they had a basis to keep working together toward <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s goal of holding elections among the Palestinians. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, in an interview broadcast today on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, said, however, he was `` adamant'' that the formula for talks with Palestinians not deviate in any way from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government's peace initiative <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also talked by telephone with Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Publicly, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> welcomed <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and said through Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> it `` reinforces what we believe _ that they are engaged and that they are working really hard to try to bridge these gaps.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, while touring the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, meanwhile, described the recently stepped-up exchange with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as positive. `` I do n't see any large gap between our views and the proposals of the secretary of state,'' he told reporters. `` But there are some differences.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposition stressed those differences. `` I do n't see anything in <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal that needs to be changed,'' said <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the Labor leader who is also finance minister. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would agree to the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan `` after the changes we proposed are accepted.'' The prime minister added: `` In a few days we will know if there is an agreement or not.'' Only one of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five points has been publicly acknowledged by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It provides for a three-way meeting of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> meets with Palestinians but before the elections are held. The other provisions are that the Israeli-Palestinian talks be held, that the elections are the focus, that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is to be `` satisfied'' with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation's composition and that <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> is free to consult any Middle Eastern parties about the makeup of the delegation. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal is that Palestinians elected on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> would make arrangements with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for five years of limited self-rule. After this trial run, Palestinians together with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, would negotiate an overall settlement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Crews began searching with heavy equipment today to clear tons of twisted, blackened rubble at a plastics plant, where a series of explosions and fire may have killed up to 22 workers, officials said. The body of third plant worker was recovered today, officials said. In addition, a worker who had been among the missing was accounted for, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Benz </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> plant. That reduced the number of presumed dead to 19, not counting the three workers whose bodies were found but not yet identified. The worker accounted for today was not at the plant during the Monday afternoon explosion, <PERSON> Benz </PERSON> said. `` They have moved in equipment overnight and they are beginning the process of searching for the missing,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' director of community affairs. `` It's liable to be a slow process, but they are working in that area now and we'll take whatever time it takes to find them.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> indicated it was unlikely that anyone in the debris is still alive. `` We always hope for the best but ...'' he trailed off. Miles of charred strings of pipe from Monday's accident were piled haphazardly around the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant. Some buildings are gone, and eight giant reactors now look like huge, smashed tin cans. `` Any employee in that wreckage probably did n't survive,'' said <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' director of public relations, looking at the scene. Officials at the company's <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, headquarters late Tuesday released a list of missing <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> employees. The plant's emergency alarm system had been tested and was problem-free hours before the explosions, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman in <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said officials were mobilizing heavy cranes and bulldozers to remove the wreckage. The effort would proceed slowly as crews look for victims while removing debris, he said. `` The devastation in the plant is a whole lot more extensive than we thought,'' said <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON>. `` Some of the buildings are gone. There's nothing there. Others are crushed in, flattened.'' Frantic relatives gathered and scanned lists of known survivors. Many held a vigil outside the complex, which produces 4.5 million pounds a day of plastics used in milk jugs and grocery sacks. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergne </PERSON>, 38, found the name of her common-law husband, <PERSON> Cipriana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 43, on the list of missing workers. `` I had just taken him lunch,'' said Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergne </PERSON>, dressed in black. `` I heard the explosion when I was going back home.'' `` I can only keep on hoping,'' she said, collapsing into tears. Of the 124 injured in the blast, 35 remained hospitalized Tuesday, with as many as six people in critical condition. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said doctors would be reporting to <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> officials later today with updates on the employees' conditions. Officials do n't know yet exactly what caused the explosions, which stemmed from a leaking chemical reactor. At least two government agencies have joined <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> in assessing the damage. `` We're going to do a thorough investigation _ not only in procedures, not only in systems, but in training the employees had to assure ourselves that every precaution was taken,'' said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Saulter </PERSON>, regional administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Occupation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Union officials say they are questioning work schedules that may have left less experienced or tired employees on the job. `` We feel like the number of hours that have been put in, particularly by some maintenance classifications, and the contractors _ the number of them that are in there working and the lack of training on their part _ it is a safety measure'' that may have contributed to the blast, said W.T. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, representative of the Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 4-227. Worker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Westerfield </PERSON>, 37, said he saw a `` red fireball ... eating up everything in sight.'' He began running out, but stopped to carry an injured co-worker, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Westerfield </PERSON> shrugged as he looked at smoke rising from the plant on Tuesday, and said he deserved no special mention. `` There ai n't no heroes out here,'' he said. `` It was just everybody trying to help everybody else.'' The plant exploded in a series of blasts Monday afternoon, sending metal and concrete debris flying as far as six miles. The blast bent nearby railroad warning signs. Twenty-five miles away, the ground shook. Authorities said it will be days and perhaps weeks before the missing workers are found. The second victim was found Tuesday, but the body could not immediately be recovered because it was partly buried in mounds of concrete and steel beams. The first fatality was discovered Monday night, but officials have not yet identified either person. The area where authorities believe most of the missing workers are entombed is a twisted jumble of rubble and debris. `` It's going to take extremely heavy equipment to remove the debris. ... We're going to have to bring in a bulldozer to make a road,'' the sheriff said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> likely will rebuild at the site, but added he was uncertain what type of facility would replace it. Workers whose jobs were displaced by the explosion will continue to be paid, he said, but some may be laid off later. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> also will try to find work for some of the workers at the company's other operations in nearby <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweeny </LOCATION> More than 900 people worked in three shifts at the plant, built in 1948 on an 800-acre complex.

 Sleek, powerful sports cars and imaginative high-tech wizardry highlight the 28th <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Motor Show, which opens for a 12-day run Friday. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 11 automakers are joined by manufacturers from 15 countries, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, showing off gadgetry ranging from fingerprint-recognition to built-in personal computers and fax machines. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> and Subaru all have new or prototype sports cars reflecting the trend toward bigger, more powerful engines. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest automaker, is showing off its 4500GT concept car, a sleek sports car with a 4.5-liter powerhouse engine churning out 300 horsepower. Concept cars are often built to give engineers an idea how it will look and perform. Modificiations, sometimes major, may be made if the car goes into production. `` I see more diversification into many varieties of sports cars,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> product planning engineer <PERSON> Masataka </PERSON> <PERSON> Esaki </PERSON>. `` Large, small, for winding roads, highway cruising, off-road driving.'' Depending on the response, concept cars displayed at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> show could become production models. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> has its $ 56,000 NSX, an aluminum-bodied, Ferrari-like speedster to be released in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next year. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> is rolling out its Eunos Roadster, called the MX-5 Miata overseas, which has proven itself as the hottest sports car of the year. Introduced in September, it has already sold out its entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock. The gull-wing TD-R concept sports car, with its 1.6-liter turbo engine, is designed especially for off-road driving. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>'s concept sports car is the 3-liter <ORGANIZATION> HSX </ORGANIZATION>, which is so aerodynamic-conscious it has hidden air spoilers that extend or lift when the car hits certain speeds or curves. <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> is showing off its conceptual `` Super Midship'' 4200R, a flat racer-like four-seater packed with digital dials and a pop-up TV screen for navigation. To top off the sports car lineup is <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>'s Caspita, jointly developed with the unlikely partner <ORGANIZATION> Wacoal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s major women's underwear manufacturer The 3.5-liter, 12-cylinder <PERSON> Caspita </PERSON> will carry a supercharged price tag of at least $ 357,000, a <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION> official said. Ferrari, <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and other foreign autmomakers also displayed new sports cars and prototypes they unveiled previously. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s Neo-X is an `` intelligent'' car with holographic displays, laser radar systems and electronic tire pressure sensors. The station wagon-like <PERSON> Boga </PERSON> has a fingerprint-recognition device for unlocking the driver's door that can recognize up to 10 different fingerprints. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s futuristic Primera-X has a rear TV camera that projects images onto the rearview mirror for backing up and a highly accurate navigation system that displays street maps on a television screen. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s No. 2 automaker also unveiled its hatchback NX-Coupe, primarily for export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from next year, the phaeton-like <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, a so-called `` retro'' two-seater whose design harks back to the 1950s but which is equipped with a turbocharged 1-liter engine, and the Chapeau, a futuristic-looking cargo vehicle. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> is also showing that it is expanding into the micro-minicar market, including one in a snappy gull-wing version. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> is bringing out its prototype RVR, a Jeep-like beachmobile of the future. Some vans on display show sophisticated technological innovation. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s MPV Executive is an office on wheels, with a personal computer, facsimile machine and built-in VHS video deck suspended from the ceiling. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s Caravan has a stacked component audio system and a fax machine for receiving photos of the Earth from a weather satellite. `` Executives want to know about the weather when it comes to playing golf,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> official said.

 An earthquake-flattened freeway is within steps of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, an oasis of learning in a crack-infested, crime-ridden, low-income housing project. And as the fourth -, fifth - and sixth-graders trickled back to class this week, they were encouragd to talk about their personal fears to help soothe any psychological jolts left over from the `` I thought I was going to die. At first I thought it was the washing machine. Then we heard plates falling,'' said <PERSON> Jamaal </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 10. `` I saw cars crushed on the freeway and the bodies were in there. It's bad,'' said one fourth-grader, sitting cross-legged in a circle of children sharing his feelings with a group. `` My grandmother had a heart attack,'' said another. `` My fish tank broke and all the fish died,'' one added. `` I tried to run but I could n't. I had to crawl,'' a student said. Psychologists throughout <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have encouraged schools to help children cope with the disruptions of the Oct. 17 earthquake. Warning signs of anxiety are trouble sleeping, clinging to parents or being excessively quiet. `` Children experience an earthquake differently,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Reece </PERSON>, chief social worker for child psycholology at <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Porter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` They feel terribly powerless. And if they see it in the papers or on TV, the earthquake happens over and over. They are simply being retraumatized,'' she said. At the Cole School, which is decorated for Halloween, students talked, drew pictures and wrote quake-related poems. The building is one block away from Interstate 880 and four blocks from a section of the elevated roadway that collapsed, killing dozens of people. There were special feelings about the plight of 6-year-old <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>, who was trapped in the carnage. Firefighters had to cut through his dead mother's body with a chain saw so doctors could amputate his right leg and free him. `` They should n't have put that on the news about that boy. That was terrible. That was personal,'' said <PERSON> Toral </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 10. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, a sixth-grader, drew a picture in crayon of the double-decked roadway. It showed columns cracking in half, cars sandwiched between layers of concrete and passengers in cars. `` I felt sorry for the people stuck in there,'' said <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>. `` It sounded like a bomb.'' About 135 people from the neighborhood were evacuated because officials feared still-standing portions of the shaky roadway could fall. Some students require passes from police to pass under the road, visible as the students jumped double-dutch rope and played basketball at recess. `` Every time they look at the freeway, they're reminded of it. They're reminded there are still bodies out there,'' said sixth-grade teacher <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbao </PERSON>. There are other reminders. Near the cafeteria, a seismometer was installed by <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to measure aftershocks. Teachers also used the device for their science classes. One tangible fear was aftershocks and reports that the quake that hit, as devastating as it was, was n't even the Big One that scientists fear. `` There's going to be another one. It's going to be so big, the ground will open up and we'll all fall in a hole,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, 11. `` Nobody sleeps. There's going to be another in the middle of the night,'' said <PERSON> Shamezo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunukanea </PERSON>, 10. `` My mother said she's going pack all her clothes and move to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tenysha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 10. <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> McHellen </PERSON>, a fourth-grade teacher, tried to calm fears with a group discussion. `` It was a natural catastrophe. If you and your family were scared, it was perfectly understandable. We had no control over it,'' she told students soothingly. She asked students to write a vertical poem, in which the first letters of the lines spell earthquake, about their experience, including this one from Akpanabio Lumukanda: `` Everyone frightened. `` All suffering. `` Rocking and cracking. `` Taking care of their children. `` Home destroyed. `` Quaking house. `` Under the freeway. `` Allowing people to go to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` Kind people helped homeless children. `` Earthquakes are scary.''

<HEAD>Gov't Unable to Buy Bumper Grain Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local governments that urged peasants to grow more grain are too short of cash to buy the bumper harvest, leaving angry peasants with grain they ca n't sell or store, an official report said Wednesday. Ever since spring planting time, Chinese leaders have been urging peasants to `` grasp grain production'' and plant grain rather than more profitable crops in order to help <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> become self-sufficient in grain. Many peasants did, and now they are mad, the Peasants' Daily said. This year's crop is estimated to top 400 million tons, making it the highest since 1984. But because of the government's year-old economic austerity program, which has sharply cut bank credit, many county grain bureaus have no cash to buy the crop. What they do buy, they ca n't sell because regional grain bureaus _ the next step in the state purchase system _ also have no money, the paper said. County grain storage facilities are overflowing, it said, and in one county in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 100,000 tons are being stored in the open and face danger of turning moldy. In another county, peasants have been stuck with more than 100,000 tons in their homes. The state's inability to buy the crop has depressed free market prices, and in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province some peasants have sold grain at fire-sale prices to itinerate profiteers to get it off their hands, the paper said. All peasants contract with the state to sell a fixed amount of grain, but they can sell the rest on the free market. In past years, free market prices were higher than state prices and in some areas local governments had trouble keeping peasants from selling their entire crops on the free market. The government fears that if all grain were bought and sold on free markets, the price would rise and trigger unrest in cities where residents are used to low state-subsidized prices. The paper noted the irony of the situation. `` Two months earlier, large numbers of officials rode in propaganda buses through the villages, mobilizing peasants to sell more grain to the state this year,'' it wrote. `` Two months later, when the peasants carried their extra grain to the grain shop, the grain shops one after another were closed. ... The peasants furiously -LRB- asked -RRB-, ` Is n't this making fun of us field hands?''' County governments dealt with a similar shortage of funds last year by issuing IOUs, but that triggered protests and violent clashes in some places. This year, the government pledged to pay cash, so that not taking the grain at all has become its only option. The government has compounded its headache by recreating a state monopoly on buying cotton this year to keep a shortage of cotton from driving prices up. The move means local governments must come up with even more funds than before. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said last week that the central bank was distributing $ 5 billion in emergency funds to local banks to help buy the harvest. The Peasants' Daily did not say if this sum would be enough. It called the problem one of `` circulation'' and urged `` responsible departments to think of solutions as soon as possible.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, stung by a drive by Democrats to portray President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as timid, hesitant and weak, described the critics Wednesday as `` yapping dogs'' determined to `` rule or ruin.'' `` They're not interested in legislating,'' said Deputy Republican Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>. `` They're just interested in seeing just who can ram it to the other side.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, replying to a remark by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday that he was tired of `` taking hits'' from opponents, said the president has no reason to complain. The president does n't mind criticizing others, but does n't want to be criticized himself, the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat said. He said criticism of the adequacy of the president's proposals for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was entirely justified because `` what the president proposed was inadequate.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and most other Democratic leaders have opened an aggressive campaign in recent weeks, repeatedly using such words as `` weak,'' and `` timid,'' and `` woefully inadequate'' to describe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts on such issues as aid for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the war against drugs On Tuesday, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> ripped into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s drive to pass a capital gains tax cut, accusing the administration of unfair tactics and declaring: `` The capital gains tax has become the Holy Grail of this administration.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the administration `` has cast aside any concern for the deficit. It has cast aside any concern for the budget process, it has now cast aside any concern for fairness and it has cast aside any concern for relations with this Congress'' on the capital gains issue. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that in making such statements, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> are reflecting `` heat from down below.'' `` It's heat from people who really do n't like to legislate; they just like to rule or ruin,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. He said these `` young Turk'' Democrats were irritated with the early tendency of both <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to accomodate the president and facilitate his programs. `` They have been saying, `` When are you going to stop that? When are you going to hammer him? `` Get him. Forget the issues. Just get him.''' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said he is not blaming <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> or <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> but is reserving his fire for those Democrats whom he said insisted on a more aggressive strategy. `` I think they grind their teeth at night,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, adding: `` They're not interested in legislating. They are just interested in seeing just who can ram it to the other side. Out of ambition ... They have a higher agenda and that's power ... And Heaven forbid, some of them even lust for the presidency.'' `` And so they rattle the cage,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` And they say things like, ` the hesitancy presidency,' which is a dazzling phrase somebody cabbaged up. ` Timid.' That's another.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been through all of that,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` In eight years -LRB- as vice president -RRB- he was called ... a ` wimp,' ` sycophant,' ` lapdog.' ... Did n't faze him a bit.'' `` So there wo n't be any response from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at these yapping dogs,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` And there are yapping dogs out there.'' Actually <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did respond in an interview on Tuesday with The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Democrats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have been calling me ` timid,' he said. `` I have other, better words like ` cautious,' ` diplomatic,' ` prudent.'''

 Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> called on legislators Wednesday to reject a peace plan they passed during a special Parliament session in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, and his hostility left him politically isolated even in his Christian camp. Fearing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s wrath might land them in jail, some Christian legislators delayed their return to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Christian political, militia and religious leaders declared cautious support for the accord. The main political alliance urged <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> leaders to `` show flexibility in dealing with it.'' Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> of the Maronite church was quoted in radio interviews from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> as supporting the plan, which would shift political control from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority to the Moslem majority but reserve the presidency for a Maronite. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> scorned it in a speech to young Christian demonstrators at the war-battered remnants of the presidential palace east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He repeated that he accepted the political reforms but rejected the accord's lack of a deadline for the withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` No to the accord of capitulation! No to surrender!'' the estimated 2,000 demonstrators chanted, waving posters of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and flags of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Parliament approved the plan Sunday after 23 days of talks in the Saudi resort of Taif. It is aimed at ending 14 years of civil war. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> _ assigned by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to mediate the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> crisis _ urged <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to convene by Nov. 7 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to formally approve it and elect a president. The White House said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supports the accord. The Lebanese Front alliance of right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> groups declared support for the plan, which was approved by 59 of the 62 lawmakers at Taif. The front's president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, voted for it. <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the main <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> political group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Lebanese Front `` pleads with all officials and leaders to show flexibility in dealing with initiatives to settle the Lebanese crisis,'' a statement said. <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> and five deputies went to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to seek church backing for the plan. Parliament deputy <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> like <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, announced in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that he will run for president. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, who has been living in self-imposed exile following repeated attempts to assassinate him in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was the first person to announce candidacy for the post. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been without a president since Sept. 22, 1988, when <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was unable to decide on a successor. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> head of an interim military Cabinet pending election of a new president. Moslems rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment and swore allegiance to the Cabinet of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. One senior official in the <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, speaking anonymously, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> felt abandoned by the plan because it does not fulfull his goal of driving the Syrians out of the country. Syrian troops were deployed in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to quell the civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said they violated the mandate by siding with the Moslems in the war. `` The general rightfully feels he is left out in the cold. He is the main loser as a result of the Taif accord and it looks like he's not going to take it gracefully,'' said the official.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of artists and their supporters staged a National Arts Advocacy Day on Wednesday and warned that theaters, museums and other institutions are being `` squeezed to death'' by government cutbacks. Subsidized theater in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is `` as much under threat as the Amazonian rain forests,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>, director of the Royal National Theatre. The demonstrators rallied at the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, home of the Royal Festival Hall and the National Theater, before heading to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> to urge lawmakers to be more generous with funding for the arts. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowis </PERSON>, a legislator for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said they would have to exert `` huge pressure'' because the arts were of little interest to most members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, or MPs. `` The last time I initiated a debate on the arts there were about 40 MPs present out of 650'' in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Speakers accused the government of underestimating the value of the arts to British life and as a revenue earner. More than 300 people attended the rally, organizers said. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has an artistic talent all round which is second to none, but which is being squeezed to death,'' said Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, the composer and conductor. Years of belt-tightening by arts organizations are being wasted because of rising inflation, said <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittner </PERSON>, the government-appointed secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes government arts subsidies. He pleaded for another $ 64 million of government aid over the next three years. Since Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives won power in 1979, government financial support for the arts has fallen by 19 percent, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Crine </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the events. Total government spending this year on arts and libraries, including the 19 national museums, is officially estimated at $ 1.3 billion, of which $ 707 million is for the arts alone. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> receives $ 245 million of that for drama, music, opera, dance, movies and videos, touring companies and art exhibitions. Local authorities spend a further $ 316 million and business sponsorship amounts to $ 47 million. Arts organizers say the inflation rate of 7.6 percent has thrown many ensembles and projects into crisis and the government's own advisory body, the <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galleries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said in July that inflation and wage increases have risen four times as much as its grants. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s flagship arts center, the heavily subsidized <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has a projected deficit this year of nearly $ 4 million; the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> is more than $ 1.58 million in the red and the National Theater, the financially strongest of the trio, only balanced its books this year by drawing on reserves. The British Museum faces the first deficit in its 236-year history, about $ 1.58 million, largely because funding has failed to match civil service pay hikes, said Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, its director. Subsidized theater in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is `` as much under threat as the Amazonian rain forests,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>, director of the Royal National Theatre. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, the millionaire real estate developer and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said last week that Britons should abandon the outdated perception of the arts as a recreational pastime for amateurs. The arts are a major industry, employing 500,000 people and with an annual revenue of $ 19 billion, he said.

 The ozone pollution reported in some cities last year was caused mostly by unusually hot weather, not dirtier air, an industry-supported analysis said Wednesday. `` The environmental community would have you believe we are in an ozone crisis, but that is not the case,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. With the exceptions of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and sometimes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` our cities are facing neither an ozone crisis nor an intractable ozone problem,'' said <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> of the Environmental Defense Fund disagreed, however, contending that `` most of the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has too much ozone.'' Emissions and weather are the factors that affect pollution, said <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>. Emissions have been increasing with the improving economy, he said. And while 1988 was an unusual year, if climate warming does occur as some scientisis fear, that would increase future pollution levels. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering legislation which would tighten emissions standards for automobiles, businesses and industry, and last summer's increased smog levels have been cited in debates over that measure. Several cities did record dramatic increases in the number of times their air quality failed to meet federal standards last year. But <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> research firm <ORGANIZATION> Roy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said his analysis of ozone readings in more than 70 major cities shows that 1988 was an aberration. For much of the nation, the summer of 1988 was the hottest since the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s, and the excessive heat generated more ozone in large cities, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Ozone, a highly reactive form of oxygen, is a major constituent of urban smog. Heat speeds the chemical reactions which form ozone. Conditions returned to nearly normal this past summer, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. For example, he said, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> exceeded ozone standards for 19 days in 1988 and only once in 1989. For other cities the excessive days included <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, 34 in 1988 and 2 in 1989, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 27 in 1988 and 3 in 1989; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 39 in 1988 and 12 in 1989 and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 30 in 1988 n <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> warehouse stocks and a pending strike vote at <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> mines in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. `` Strikes and shutdowns that had been supporting prices for a while back are settled and copper is not in such tight supply,'' said <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>. Copper settled 35 to 45 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in October at $ 1.15 a pound. Also on the Comex, the steadier stock market and stronger dollar sent gold and silver futures slightly lower. `` It's been a pretty dead metals market lately, with not much major news to generate any sudden shifts,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Deak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Gold settled $ 1 to $ 1.10 lower, with the contract for delivery in October at $ 369.10 a troy ounce; and silver was 3.4 cents to 3.5 cents lower, with October at $ 5.114 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices were mostly higher in very light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Futures were supported by a false rumor during the day that an earthquake had hit <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>, senior oil anaylst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He also said traders were discounting the 6.304 million barrels of crude oil listed in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> inventory report. `` They believe stocks were depleted by the effects of Hurricane <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and there will be off-setting figures in next week's report,'' said <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> Crude futures settled 10 cents lower to 23 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in November at $ 18.83 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with November at 58.44 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .61 cent higher, with November at 53.40 a gallon. Futures prices for corn and soybeans climbed higher, but wheat prices sagged on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. This week's light trading continued for a third day, with little outside news of any major consequence for the futures markets, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Lack of export demand and beneficial rains for both the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter crop were depressing wheat prices, Ms. <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON> said. Supporting futures prices was new Soviet interest in the agricultural markets, as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> purchased 50,000 metric tons of Argentine meal and 350,000 metric tons of corn from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> since Tuesday, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a floor trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled 1 \ cents to 6 \ cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.05 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 \ cents higher, with December at $ 2.42 \ a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents lower, with December at $ 1.46 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents higher, with November at On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, livestock and pork prices were mostly higher. `` We had a late rally in the final 20 minutes, mostly on commission house buying,'' said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> analyst <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Lighter supplies of cattle, but not so light for hogs were affecting prices, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. Cattle settled .02 cent lower to .03 cent higher, with the contract for delivery in December at 75.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower to .30 cent higher, with October at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .27 cent higher, with December at 47.80 cents a pound; and forzen pork bellies were .20 cent to .55 cent higher with February at 53.32 cents a pound. The stock-index futures traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> followed the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to lower ground. The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.85 points lower at 344.65.

<HEAD>Bush Costa Rican Trip to Underscore Desire for Change in Nicaragua,

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on Friday to join an international celebration of a century of democracy in the host country and underscore his desire for political change in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Administration officials say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s participation in two days of ceremonies hosted by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> will be low-key. The president, one of 18 heads of state expected to attend, is not on the list of speakers for the formal proceedings. `` The diplomacy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is such that you do n't want to do anything to try and upstage these countries ... We are going to pay respect to them,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. At the same time, administration and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to sign a general communique that Costa Rican officials had prepared to express support for democracy and environmental protection. The president `` objected to signing any statement with -LRB- Nicaraguan President -RRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>,'' said one administration official, who added that for a variety of reasons, the paper will not be issued. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Wednesday he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be discussing three `` challenges to democracy'' with officials at the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> sessions _ illegal drug trafficking, the aut the first woman justice in the 200-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, gave Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> the vote he had sought for 16 years _ a working majority to begin dismantling the `` Roe'' decision written by fellow Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> in 1973. For now, business continues as usual at most of the clinics and hospitals that annually perform legal abortions on three out of every 100 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women of childbearing age. Under the new ruling, more than 95 percent could proceed without legal interruption, because that is the proportion who get abortions earlier than the point at which the states may now intercede. But with three more challenges to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> on the justices' docket, it may not be long before the court jettisons the landmark 1973 decision entirely, allowing states either to re-criminalize all abortions or impose any of dozens of proposed restrictions, ranging from mandatory parental or spousal consent to forced medical testing of the fetus and psychological counseling of the mother. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> himself wrote that the signs his decision will be explicitly overturned `` are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.'' Some saw the Missouri ruling as the grandest judicial affirmation to date of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s revolution. Others say it may prove, ironically, to unravel it. The opinion of the court's majority simply is not shared by the majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> Most polls, including a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey last summer, say that by a 2-1 margin, Americans believe abortions should be legal. But they are more evenly divided, and in some cases tilt the other way, on questions regarding public spending, parental consent and related curbs. <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, director of a women's clinic in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, puts t this way: `` Americans favor abortion only in the case of rape, incest and their own personal circumstance.'' Democratic pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> says many Republicans outside the religious right _ those in the suburban mainstream of the party _ `` have always given a wink and a nod'' to their candidates' stated abortion views. But now that the court has made abortion a hot political issue, he says, `` many will not find that acceptable anymore.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> echoed that view when he warned <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> politicians that suburban defections `` could drive a stake through the heart of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coalition.'' Republican consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, however, says the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which unequivocally endorsed abortion rights in its platform last year, stands to lose its last conservative bloc, the urban, blue-collar Roman Catholics. There are no guarantees to any of these theories. Even the Catholic coalition can not be taken for granted, despite the church's vehement opposition to abortion. Indeed, <PERSON> Guttmacher </PERSON> researchers have found that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> women are more likely to have an abortion than either Protestant or Jewish women _ probably because they practice less birth control. Another somewhat startling finding: One out of every six women who have an abortion describes herself as an evangelical Christian. There will be some early clues on the political scene. Abortion is an issue in two gubernatorial races next month, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, as well as the mayoral contest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. And next year, 36 gubernatorial races as well as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a third of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be fought. The pro-choice movement, meanwhile, is back on the march _ starting with a demonstration that drew more than 300,000 people to the capital on the eve of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s hearing of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case. And it was buoyed last month by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s wholesale rebuke of the anti-abortion laws Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> tried to push through a special session. Moreover, for the first time this decade, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill that would have granted rape and incest victims federal assistance for abortions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed it this past week. `` Read our lips: Take our rights, lose your jobs,'' says <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. At its 20th anniversary convention, the league named nine politicians, including <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, as special targets for defeat next year. According to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, abortion is likely to become `` The <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics _ a no-win issue.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pollster <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> says the nation's 7,500 state legislators are `` saying ` Oh, my God,' and wondering how they can control the damage.'' The anit-abortion movement, meanwhile, is content to take things one step at a time. `` We believe the court will permit the states and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to restrict the reasons for abortions,'' says <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Overall, more than half the states are regarded as likely to enact some restrictions, another eight to 10 are battlegrounds, and 10 to 15 are likely to retain full abortion-on-demand rights. Part of the strategy of abortion opponents is to create such a blizzard of consent and testing requirements that clinics and doctors will give up their abortion services as legally or financially risky. The anti-abortion shock troops, meanwhile, belong to `` Operation Rescue,'' a largely white, evangelical Christian group that counts 35,000 members and thousands of arrests while demonstrating at abortion clinics around the country. Typically, its `` rescues'' entail forming a human blockade around the clinic, while `` sidewalk counselors'' attempt to turn away the women trying to get through. Some protestors have entered clinics and damaged medical equipment with eggs and fake blood. The group, disowned by many in the anti-abortion movement, is led by young <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who carts a disfigured, splotchy fetus he calls `` Baby Choice'' around the country in a jar of formaldehyde. At news conferences, he lays the fetus out in a tiny coffin lined with white satin. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, a former used-car salesman, will point to the fetus and declare: `` That's not a blob of cells. That's a little girl.'' Operation Rescue also distributes a video designed to evoke equal shock. It features shots of aborted fetuses mixed with scenes of Nazi concentration camps. A somewhat milder video, called `` the Silent Scream,'' has been circulated for years by other anti-abortion groups. Now, the pro-choice forces are distributing a video of their own. Produced by the Fund for the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION>, it is called `` Abortion: For Survival'' and depicts an actual abortion that lasts 84 seconds and shows two aborted embryos, amounting to about two tablespoons of blood and tissue. The point is to demonstrate that what is swept from the womb in most abortions is not nearly the baby-like figure depicted by the opposition. Whatever the tactics, the abortion war looms, like the civil rights struggle and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, as a long and painful one for the country. The difference is that nobody predicts an end to this fight, by law or by conscience.

<HEAD>Bush Will Act to Ease Consumer Concerns Over Pesticides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Moving to ease consumer concerns over food safety, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is preparing to announce a streamlining of regulations so that dangerous chemicals can be taken off the market more quickly, sources said Wednesday. The administration's new policy for dealing with pesticides and other chemicals in foods is aimed at giving the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> greater flexibility in dealing with food safety issues. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> declined on Wednesday to provide details of the impending policy announcement, but told reporters `` it's responsive to a number of problems this agency has had in administering our pesticide law.'' The president is expected to announce the food safety initiative at the White House on Thursday. Industry spokesmen reserved comment on the new policy until it is announced. Environmentalists said that while they welcome some aspects of the new policy, they have concerns about other provisions. According to sources familiar with the revision, it will include a shift in the procedures used by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in determine whether a potentially dangerous pesticide should be taken off the market. The EPA no longer will be required to have a formal judicial hearing and may opt for a swifter rulemaking process that could significantly reduce the time it takes to ban a chemical. Environmentalists said that such a shift could reduce the time it takes to get a dangerous pesticide off the market from as long as eight years under current procedures to about two years. If risks warrant, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also will be given greater leeway in suspending use of pesticides and other chemicals used on foods while the formal proceedings get underway, the sources said. The agency will no longer have to prove an `` imminent hazard'' to public health to suspend a chemical, as is required under current policy. In some cases, the agency will not have to take into account economic ramifications of its action in suspending a chemical. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been under attack from environmentalists for failing to act swiftly to protect the country's food supply from dangerous levels of pesticide residues _ including carcinogens _ in foods, especially on fruits and vegetables. The issue gained widespread attention earlier this year when <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged that daminozide, a growth-regulating compound marketed under the name Alar, caused cancer, but were unable to take it off the market immediately because the agency did believe it met the `` imminent hazard'' standard. A public outcry over the use of Alar on apples subsequently caused its manufacturer to stop selling the chemical voluntarily. The maker of another widely used chemical, the fungicide EBDC, recently announced it was stopping sale of the compound for use on a variety of food crops, but continued to make it available for use on many other fruits and vegetables. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been reviewing the status of <ORGANIZATION> EBDC </ORGANIZATION> since 1977, when it was discovered that a byproduct of the family of fungicides is a potential human carcinogen. Although the new administration policy will allow the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to make more timely decisions on protecting foods from harmful pesticide residues, the plan also contains provisions that are expected to be attacked by environmentalists. The policy, for example, will relax the threshold at which a chemical in some cases will be considered to pose an unacceptable risk, according to the sources, who commented under the condition that they not be further identified. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> under current policy has said action is warranted if the risk of cancer or other serious illness is 1 in 1 million. Under the new policy, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> may choose not to act in some cases unless the risk is as great as 1 in 100,000. In addition, the administration will propose that pesticide regulation be `` uniform'' across the country. That, according to environmentalists, amounts to administration endorsement of congressional action to pre-empt states from imposing tougher pesticide laws than federal requirements. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION> said any preemptive provision would be opposed by environmentalists. `` Most of the major federal actions -LRB- in the past on pesticides -RRB- have been preceded by state actions which serve as an important check and balance,'' said <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bush Presses for Senate Vote on Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forcefully pressed for a clear shot at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on a lower capital gains tax in a meeting Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, but was told his chances were slim, participants said. The lawmakers said after a White House meeting that they told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his only realistic hope was to support a compromise package that included other items as well. While balking at the notion of delaying action on such a measure until next year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed willingness to discuss a compromise package, said the senators. Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, said when he proposed that the capital gains change be linked with a higher minimum wage, White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> `` put a pad in front of me and said, ` Write it out.''' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> was one of eight Democrats invited to the White House by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the president continued to lobby Democrats for a straightforward vote on the capital gains proposal. The White House is seeking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of a provision passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would lower the tax on capital gains _ profits from the sale of real estate, stocks and other assets _ to 19.6 percent for two years, from the current maximum rate of 33 percent. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership has resisted scheduling a simple vote on the measure, and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the past few days has stepped up its lobbying campaign. `` If the administration continues to push for an up-and-down vote on capital gains to the exclusion of everything else, that's just not going to happen,'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said Senators who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the president was repeatedly told there was little likelihood he would get a vote on a separate capital gains tax bill this year. The blunt assessment was more substantial in that it came from a group of Democrats who in the past had supported either a capital gains tax cut, or some form of capital gains incentives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, Wyche <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Participants said that, in addition to the capital gains proposal, the final package might include a Democratic-sponsored plan to expand coverage of <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> as well as legislation to deal with the minimum wage and child care. `` It's clear that most people feel they've got to resolve this in some sort of sensible way that involves compromises on both sides,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> told reporters. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president was agreeable to `` possible compromises'' on the proposal, but did not suggest what form such a package might take. `` We are working to pick up new votes all the time,'' he said. However, it seemed unlikely <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked up any in Wednesday's session `` The president presented his position very forcefully,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. Participants said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened Wednesday's meeting by denying that he was seeking to make the issue a `` Holy Grail,'' as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, had asserted on Tuesday. The House attached the capital gains cut to broader deficit-reduction bill which is now in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version does not contain the cut. Democrats have threatened to filibuster if the conference committee produces a compromise version containing the capital gains provision. It would take 60 votes to shut off such a filibuster, votes Republicans do not appear to have. Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> began the efforts Wednesday to work out a compromise between the different deficit-reduction bills passed by the two chambers but made little headway.

 Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> for the first time acknowledged <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> bankrolled terrorist groups but said he mistakenly thought the action would further the Arab cause, according to an interview published Wednesday. `` At one point, we supported some of these groups without meticulously examining their aims and role,'' the Egyptian government-owned weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mussawar </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` But when we discovered that these groups were causing more harm than benefit to the Arab cause, we halted our aid to them completely and withdrew our support,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mussawar </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Makram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a confidant of Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also said he wants no confrontation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and would welcome a dialogue toward friendlier relations. The magazine said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> conducted the interview a week ago, a day after <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tobruk </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast to discuss improving relations after 16 years of friction <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, a disciple of the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> and currently the main proponent of <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s ideas on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity, did not identify any terror groups that were backed by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. One is known to be the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a dissident Palestinian group led by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Banna </PERSON>. In the past, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> insisted he helped only nationalist, not international movements. `` We erroneously thought that these groups could be part of the -LRB- Arab -RRB- national liberation movement,'' he said. `` But we found out that they were practicing terrorism for the sake of terrorism and for other objectives that had nothing to do with our national cause. `` Let me tell you frankly that hijacking planes and killing civilians are acts of murder that have nothing to do with combat,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> -RRB- should not be called to account for any of these acts, because we have withdrawn our support of such groups.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s sponsorship of international terror was the principal cause of his rift with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In September 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials presented to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> a selected chronology specifying 60 cases of what they termed <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s terrorism and support for various terrorist groups. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes raided two <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> cities, the capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> in April 1986, 10 days after <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was blamed for masterminding the bombing of a discotheque in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> frequented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier and a woman died in the bombing and 200 people were wounded. In the interview, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> seemed to be telling the Americans he wants bygones to be bygones and is eager to turn a new leaf. He said he would welcome a dialogue with the Americans `` anywhere they want on condition it is held in the public eye. `` I say very clearly: We do not believe that conflict with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is necessary.

He blamed former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` muscle-flexing'' for complications in <LOCATION> American-Libyan </LOCATION> relations and said he felt that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration `` will be more rational.'' In the eight-page interview, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also made these points: _ <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has enough arms to meet its needs and is not seeking more from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, its principal armorer. _ <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> would not object to a proposed peace dialogue between the Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> should pursue their reconciliation and forge closer relations.

In <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, police on Wednesday blocked 800 Libyans who arrived by boat to mark a day of `` mourning'' declared by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> for Libyans deported during Italian colonial rule. Police said the passengers lacked entry visas. The Libyans, as well as several hundred others who have arrived over the past few days, were planning to take part in demonstrations scheduled in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and other cities on Thursday. The demonstrations are in memory of Libyans deported to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> during colonial rule between 1911 and the end of World War II. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> contends at least 4,000 Libyans were sent to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says Oct. 26 is the 78th anniversary of the first deportations to remote Italian islands. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> wants <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to pay reparations for its colonial occupation. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> insists it met its obligations by paying $ 6.7 million in 1956 under an agreement with the Libyan monarchy later deposed by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in a 1969 coup.

 Firefighter <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, who rescued a woman 12 years ago only to have her die, grabbed the woman pinned in her blazing Marina apartment and held on like man in a grudge match with death. The 19-year veteran firefighter found <PERSON> Sherra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> lying in the dust and blackness, trapped under a door and doorframe when two upper floors of her apartment building collapsed during the Oct. 17 earthquake. `` When somebody holds your hand and you're a few feet away, I doubt I'll ever feel that again. I felt like I knew her and I could n't go no matter what was happening,'' said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, 44. When he heard someone was trapped, he found an opening in the rubble of a sidewall. Throwing off his coat and helmet, he crawled inside the dark two-foot hole lighting his way with a flashlight. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, 55, had dislodged an iron pole and was banging it with her one free arm. `` I am here,'' she called to <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, who crawled toward the voice. Outside, firefighters and spectators, who smelled the gas enveloping the building and saw flames igniting, yelled for <PERSON> Sannnon </PERSON> to leave. `` It got real bright and hot when the building across the street fell. I saw her eyes got wide. I heard someone stick his head in and yell to get out. She just squeezed hard and said, ` Please do n't leave me,'' he said The struggle brought back memories of 12 years ago when <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> was off-duty and pulled a woman from an apartment fire, but she died shortly after of smoke inhalation. `` What I've thought the most about is when I heard everybody tell me to get out. ... I knew the building was on fire, and it felt like we were both done for but I could n't leave her,'' he said. But <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> needed equipment or both could die. He crawled outside, and Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boudoures </PERSON> handed him a chainsaw. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> went back and began to cut the timbers. After more than an hour, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> cut Cox free. Another rescue worker shoved in a stretcher and helped pull Cox out. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where she underwent seven hours of surgery for a dislocated, fractured hip and cracked pelvis. She was in fair to good condition Wednesday. `` I saw her yesterday in the hospital. She's doing great. She's a real tough gal,'' said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>

 Earthquakes on one side of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> have been matched within three years by similar-sized quakes on the other side, raising the possibility that another might now be due in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, researchers say. An earthquake that hit <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s side of the bay in 1836 was followed by a quake on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> side in 1838, and an earthquake that hit the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in 1865 was followed by an <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> quake three years later. All the earthquakes had magnitudes of 6.3 to 7.0. The 1865 earthquake occurred near the <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> area of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, where the Oct. 17 earthquake occurred, according to a report to appear Friday in Science magazine. An <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> quake similar in size on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale to the Oct. 17 earthquake would cause far more damage, said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` As horrible as this one is, it's just nothing compared to when we get an earthquake this size in the urban areas -LRB- in and near <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he told Science. <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON> could not be reached Wednesday. <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON> and their colleagues in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> report that the 70 years leading up to the big <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906 were marked by numerous earthquakes, and that activity was sharply reduced after the big quake.

 Palestinians killed three fellow Arabs in the occupied territories on Wednesday, including a woman accused of subverting the Palestinian revolt by dealing in prostitution. As police found the body of one victim in an abandoned car, masked youths appeared on a nearby hill and shouted `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> akbar!'' _ Arabic for `` God is great!'' In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, judges sentenced a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> to life in prison plus 20 years after he pleaded guilty to murdering an Israeli construction worker and trying to careen a crowded public bus into a steep ravine last month. Also Wednesday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace proposals must be changed to more closely reflect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s own initiative before they can be accepted by the government. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to exclude <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> as the site for a preliminary Israel-Palestinian meeting and to change language suggesting Palestinians from outside the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> may take part, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, police found the body of an accused collaborator, <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahlawi </PERSON>, 29, in the trunk of a car parked north of his home village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION>. They said an initial investigation indicated he was shot to death. Masked youths fled the scene after shouting their war cry. In the <LOCATION> Mughazi </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, masked youths stabbed and beat to death Fayza <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salam </PERSON>, 50, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. She was accused of dealing in prostitution. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, eight masked men kidnapped <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wafa </PERSON>, 38, from his house in the northern town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> on Tuesday, axed him to death and dumped his body near his house, town residents told reporters. The residents said al-Wafa was accused of working with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence agents and dealing in drugs. The army spokesman's office confirmed the deaths of both Ms. <PERSON> Salam </PERSON> and al-Wafa. The deaths raised to 135 the number of Palestinians killed by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as suspected collaborators, or as drug dealers or prostitutes, during the 22-month Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, a district court sentenced 26-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukry </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, to life plus 20 years after he pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of murder and 51 counts of attempted murder. <PERSON> Shukry </PERSON>'s second sentence would start should he be granted parole, which is possible after 20 years under a life sentence in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, meaning he faced at least 40 years in prison. <PERSON> Shukry </PERSON> was convicted of murdering <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshtener </PERSON>, 38, at a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> building site Sept. 7 and of stabbing an Israeli bus driver two days later in an attempt to force a bus off the <LOCATION> Jerusalem-Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> highway into a ravine. <PERSON> Shukry </PERSON>'s attempt occurred near the spot where a Palestinian forced a bus on the same route off a cliff on July 6, killing 16 Jews, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourist and two Canadians. `` In the occupied territories -LRB- Arab -RRB- children are being killed every day,'' army radio quoted <PERSON> Shukry </PERSON> as telling the court. `` I wanted to kill Jewish children.'' At least 603 Palestinians have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians in the uprising. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, more than 120 of those killed were under age 16. Forty Israelis have also died in the violence. The foreign minister, interviewed by government-run radio, disputed a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he already had agreed in principle to a five-point peace plan of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` We are working in order to ensure that the formula presented by the secretary of state will be the same as the government's decision, the government's initiative,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> told the radio from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, where he is attending a meeting The Israeli peace initiative calls for elections in the occupied lands to select Palestinians to open talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited autonomy. It rules out any role for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terrorist organization. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have opposed <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> as a venue for preliminary talks because they believe <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is trying to act as an intermediary for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the suggested changes will be reviewed but cautioned: `` If we start making changes for one side, we will find ourselves in an extended negotiating session in terms of making changes that might be requested. `` It would be much better if both sides would accept the five points as a general framework for moving forward,'' he said. A Foreign Ministry official said he could not comment until he saw a text of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remarks.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> on Wednesday defended his agency's political independence and warned that proposals to make the central bank more accountable to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration could hamper its fight against inflation. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was the lead-off witnesses as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> launched its first major review in more than a decade of the operations of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and its chairman, often called the second most powerful man in the country because of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s power over interest rates. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he opposed a bill sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, that they say would make the central bank's deliberations less secretive and more accountable to the public The Hamilton-Dorgan bill would require the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s top policy-making body, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials at regular intervals. The bill would also require immediate release of decisions made by the <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION> and it would change the term of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman so that an incoming president would be able to appoint a new chairman sooner after taking office. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> rejected all of these proposals, contending they increased the risks that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would set interest rates in response to political pressures rather than on judgments about what was best for the long-run health of the economy. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> must take actions that, while sometimes unpopular in the short-run, are in the long-run best interests of the country,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said, adding the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s 75-year history of independence had `` served the country well.'' While voicing strong opposition to the <LOCATION> Hamilton-Dorgan </LOCATION> bill, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> did endorse a separate resolution sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, that would write into law a requirement that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> eliminate inflation and give the central bank five years to reach that goal. Terming <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s measure a `` laudable'' effort to clarify the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s mandate, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> warned that wringing inflation out of the economy over the next five years would have short-term costs in terms of slower growth. He termed the 1994 deadline achievable and said it could be accomplished without plunging the country into a recession. Consumer prices, after spurting up sharply early in the year, are now rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, very close to the rate of inflation over the past several years. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s measure does not include any penalties if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> fails to meet the five-year deadline for eliminating inflation, but <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> argued that the resolution would clarify existing law, which directs the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to pursue the sometimes conflicting goals of promoting employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. In his appearance before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> sought to play down reports of a major rift between the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration over interest rates. The administration has been pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to lower rates in an effort to spur economic growth and lower the international exchange rate of the dollar. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that he and the administration `` have differences on occasions'' but that what was being interpreted as major disputes were in reality only disagreements concerning `` relatively minor issues of tactics.'' Both the <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> measure and the <LOCATION> Hamilton-Dorgan </LOCATION> proposal are given slight chance of getting through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where key members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have given the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> high marks and said they see no reason to make changes.

<HEAD>House Votes to Defer Deporting Chinese, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Wednesday voted 258-162 to protect thousands of illegal aliens who fled conflict in their homelands by deferring their deportation to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` It will create humanitarian relief for three categories of individuals who are here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and for whom there is no will to send them back,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. The bill, which now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would suspend for three years deportation of Chinese, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans who register within nine months. It would stop short of granting political asylum or permanent resident status, but would provide temporary protection to perhaps 750,000 exiles. It also would establish a system for extending such temporary status to citizens of additional countries beset by armed conflict and natural disaster. The measure is designed to furnish shelter to those who have fled civil war in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and face government persecution as a result of the student democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Proponents said 70,000 Salvadorans and 30,000 Nicaraguan civilians have been killed in civil wars in their countries over the last decade and that 10,000 participants in the Chinese democracy demonstrations have been jailed. They scoffed at complaints that the measure would create an exception that would undermine existing immigration law. Critics said it was a mistake to combine relief measures for the Central Americans and the Chinese. They said the measure would merely provide Central Americans hungry for American jobs with a foot in the door. `` What we are going to do is grant a permanent status not to people who came here for any political reason but for people who came here for an economic reason to take jobs away from American workers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa. Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., a supporter of the measure, retorted that the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and a number of large labor unions have endorsed the `` So evidently they are n't afraid,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, R-Md., cited estimates that the price tag on operation of the measure could reach $ 260 million over two years `` I can tell you that my constituents will not abide by it,'' she declared. Rep. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said that illegal aliens who have fled the three countries already are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think its in our interest to have Nicaraguans and Salvadorans living in the open rather than maintaining an underground existence,'' he said. `` This bill is the right thing to do,'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. He urged help for those `` uprooted for political reasons, who have been escaping tragedy.''

<TEXT>
 The foreign minister said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas seized the strategic Cambodian town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, a victory that could block the movement of government troops and supplies to nearby cities. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> said in a radio broadcast the seizure opened the door for an assault on the city of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, and it advised government soldiers to leave the area `` in order to stay alive.'' The guerrillas said they took <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, along the Thai border, on Sunday after a two-year offensive. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> confirmed the report and said the guerrillas also captured artillery guns, tanks and ammunition stockpiles. He was the first Thai official to confirm the guerrilla takeover. It could be a major victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in its war to oust the government <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed after its 1978 invasion. Government soldiers had vowed to hold onto <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, which is along Route 10 leading to the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, 40 miles away. <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s largest city after the capital, <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> broadcast said guerrillas routed the 196th division, two brigades and three provincial regiments in their two-day final offensive on <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> town has a very important strategic role for the Vietnamese enemy and puppets, militarily, politically and economically,'' it said. `` Particularly in the military aspect, it is a strategic door directly relating to the survival of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> town.'' The broadcast said pro-Vietnamese forces face serious problems trying to move soldiers and supplies to defend Route 10 and <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>. `` Parents and compatriots,'' it said, `` please call on your children and husbands to quickly desert for home ... in order to stay alive. `` What is the use of the remaining district and provincial units fighting and dying?'' The broadcast said some Vietnamese disguised as <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> soldiers helped the Cambodian troops defend <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said it pulled the last of its soldiers from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> last month, but the guerrillas say thousands are still in the country. The Vietnamese withdrawal raised fears the Cambodian army would not be able to hold its own against the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the two non-communist guerrilla groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the army of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the strongest of the coalition. Thai military sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed 120 government soldiers and captured 17 at <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON>, who spoke at a weekly news briefing, said neither the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government nor the guerrillas is strong enough to win a clear victory in the war. `` In the end they will have to compromise and come back to negotiations,'' he said. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is leading efforts to revive peace negotiations, stalled since the failure of an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in August. The main stumbling block was the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government's refusal to agree to a government role for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which massacred hundreds of thousands of Cambodians in the 1970s before it was ousted.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Holds First Plenum Since Soviet Withdrawal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ruling party on Wednesday opened its first plenum since the Soviet troop withdrawal and promoted to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> several leading figures who opposed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s intervention in the Afghan war Several rockets slammed into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing six people. Four members of one family were killed when a missile crashed through their house and exploded. Women stood in the courtyard of the house wailing in mourning. Another rocket landed in the hills behind <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The plenum was held amid tight security in deteriorating government buildings in downtown <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It elected 19 new full members and one alternate to the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ruling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, a government spokesman said. Two new members were also appointed to the Politburo, the highest policy-making body in the country. A tank manned by several soldiers stood at one end of the street near the meeting place. Dozens of troops patrolled the streets nearby. The party changes were intended to unite the party and increase support from the military, diplomats and an Afghan government source said. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> addressed the meeting and said the party was ready to unite with all `` progressive'' groups to achieve peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It was the first full party meeting since October 1988. The Soviet-backed government is in the middle of a civil war against U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. Although fighting appears stalemated, the rebels control much of the countryside. Among the new Central Committee members are <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Misaq </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghorbandi </PERSON>, both leading members of the ruling party's <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> faction, which opposed the Soviet military intervention in 1979. The intervention brought <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>'s opponent, the <LOCATION> Parcham </LOCATION> faction, to power. The two factions have been bitter enemies since the 1960s. Traditionally, <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, which means `` masses,'' had much support in the military and <LOCATION> Parcham </LOCATION>, meaning `` flag,'' was popular among intellectuals. Neither can claim much popular support. The Khalq group has long been critical of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s military presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and blames <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s current plight on the policies of the <LOCATION> Parcham </LOCATION>. Since the last Soviet troops withdrew in February, the party's <ORGANIZATION> Parcham </ORGANIZATION> leadership, especially <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, has sought to blunt such criticism by bringing <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> members into government `` These moves are necessary to show the rebels that our ranks are united,'' said a government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We are showing that we have a strong party.'' The official said the <ORGANIZATION> Parcham </ORGANIZATION> group was also bringing <LOCATION> Khalq </LOCATION> people into the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Commtttee </LOCATION> because they need military support. The Khalq group has strong military backing. It was the military that put the <LOCATION> Khalq </LOCATION> faction in power in April 1978 when officers loyal <PERSON> Khalq </PERSON> staged a Communist coup. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to replace that government with another, then stayed to help fight the guerrillas. Also appointed to the Central Committee were the secretaries of several provincial party committees. Afghan guerrillas said they have scored more victories against government forces in the past two weeks than at any time since the Soviet troops left. <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefrey </PERSON>, information minister in the rebels' government-in-exile, made the claim in a news conference in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> The guerrillas are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. This month, the guerrillas stopped a major army convoy that was heading south from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to supply troops defending <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, an eastern garrison town 90 miles away that has been under siege since August. <PERSON> Lefrey </PERSON> said the air force then tried to drop supplies to <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> by parachute but that many landed in guerrilla-controlled areas nearby.

 A deaf teen-age girl who walked into a school nervously seeking help was apparently kidnapped several years ago and moved around the country, possibly by satanists, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent said Wednesday. `` From some of the drawings she was able to provide, it is believed that some of the people she was with since her abduction may have been tied to the occult,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said. Authorities have had a hard time gathering information from the frightened, confused girl, but she has given them drawings that include symbols associated with satanism and indicated she may have been abducted from a foster home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said. The girl showed up Sept. 18 at <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, identifying herself in sign language as <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. `` She just stopped at the counter. She walked in and signed a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a teacher's aide who called in a teacher who speaks in sign language. The teacher realized the girl needed help and took her to the Governor <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> School for the Deaf in nearby <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>, where authorities began questioning her. `` Over the next few weeks, <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> provided information which leads us to believe that she is possibly the victim of a kidnapping abduction,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement issued by its <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office. `` <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> has indicated that she is not sure <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> is her real name, but is the name given to her by her abductors,'' the statement said. `` She stated she believes she is 15 years of age and possibly was born on Dec. 25, 1974. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> seems to possess a good vocabulary and is far ahead of children in her age bracket in intelligence and communication skills.'' <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said Wednesday from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that psychologists and child-care experts dealing with the girl have pieced together enough information to believe she was abducted from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> about three years ago, then moved several times, possibly into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` She claims to have been abducted by a male out there who was driving a van at the time,'' <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said. He said authorities had no reason to doubt the girl's story, but had found no missing person reports matching her. `` We did receive a communication on it,'' Supervisory Special Agent <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said Wednesday. `` Anything we're requested by the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> division to do, we'll be doing.'' Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON> declined further comment. <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> said Wednesday that his department had received numerous calls, but had no immediate leads on the girl's family or any suspects in her abduction. Authorities said the girl was in the care of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` She's in a safe place in the state,'' <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> said. `` She's comfortable. She's being taken care of.'' <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> said authorities believed the girl had been abused, but he did not think she had been emotionally able to undergo physical tests that would determine whether she had been sexually abused. The elementary teacher who was able to sign with the girl said Wednesday she took her to the <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> because the girl quickly indicated she needed help. `` I realized she was a deaf person in a hearing environment, and she would do better in a deaf environment,'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Papi-Stratton </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Papi-Stratton </PERSON> declined to say what the girl told her. At the <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, superintendent <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fries </PERSON> said she had been advised by authorities and her superiors not to discuss specifics of the case. The principal of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON>, <PERSON> Myrt </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, said employees who saw the girl described her as `` frightened and anxious,'' although there was nothing unusual about her appearance or dress. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statement on the girl described her as a caucasian, about 5 feet tall and 105 pounds, with blond or light brown wavy hair and blue eyes.

<HEAD>Farm Values Seen Climbing at Slower Pace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A panel of rural appraisers says farmland values are expected to continue rising in 1990, but at a much slower rate than this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Based on a survey made in early August, farmland prices are likely to rise an average 3.5 percent by August, 1990. That would be about half the 6.5 percent increase reported for 1988-89. One reason suggested by appraisers for the slow-down is a drop in corn and soybean prices from the drought-levels of last year. But higher wheat prices probably are helping support some values, particularly in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. A group of about 500 appraisers is checked quarterly by a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> survey laboratory for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said analyst <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON>, author of the report <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the year-ahead estimate by appraisers was `` somewhat lower than we have been forecasting'' within the agency. The information is being reviewed and will be considered when <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> issues its next farmland forecast late in November. The report said appraisers expect land values to rise the fastest in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> region, up 4.8 percent during the 1989-90, compared with a 9.5 percent increase reported in 1988-89. No state estimates were included in the report. `` While corn and soybean prices remain relatively high compared with recent years, current prices are lower than last year and may have contributed to the less-optimistic outlook,'' the report said. `` In contrast, high and rising wheat prices are llikely providing strength to the region's land values.'' In the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, appraisers expect land values to increase an average of 2.7 percent in 1989-90, compared with 5.5 percent the previous 12 months. `` Principal factors behind the 2.7 percent increase expected in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> are commodity price movements, lower interest rates and improving farm incomes,'' the report said. `` During the past year, the appraisers said high commodity prices, government programs and favorable weather contributed to higher farmland values in the South.'' Farmland in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was forecast by appraisers to appreciate about 3 percvent, compared with 4.1 percent in 1988-89. `` High commodity prices, including cattle, and stronger demand by non-agricultural investors are the most frequently cited factors behind the increases,'' the report said. Values in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> are expected to rise an average of 1.4 percent in 1989-90, compared with 2.8 percent the previous year.

<HEAD>Soviet Foreign Minister Meets Communist Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Wednesday his country is determined to maintain friendly relations with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Communists and with the non-Communists leading the government. `` I think it is an interesting period and obviously this situation deserves introducing some corrections,'' the chief Soviet diplomat said when asked about the current state of Soviet-Polish relations. `` First of all we have to rebuild the mechanisms of economic relations and increase the effectiveness of our cooperation,'' he said, without elaborating. A joint communique said both sides agreed mutual problems should be solved on the basis of the principles of freedom of choice and non-intervention in internal affairs. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the election to prime minister Aug. 24 of <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist prime minister. After meeting with him Tuesday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> announced <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next month. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> demonstrated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s apparent openness to Polish pluralism Wednesday when he invited <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a top Solidarity editor and former political prisoner, to join him for part of a session with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>. Afterward, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> declared he is willing to meet with `` every party, with anybody.'' <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, editor in chief of the pro-Solidarity <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> daily and one of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s keenest observers of Soviet affairs, was the only journalist ushered into the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> conference room. They talked for about 10 minutes before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> came out and spoke with other reporters. The Soviet government has said it views the radical changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as internal political matters. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is determined to maintain friendly relations with the new Solidarity-led coalition government as well as with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Speaking of `` blanks spots'' in Polish-Soviet history, such as the massacre of Polish soldiers on Soviet soil during World War II, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said they would be cleared up. `` We want only the truth. It is needed by our two nations and is in the interest of friendship,'' he said. The joint communique said both sides had `` confirmed the will to explain some problems and history of Polish-Soviet relations. Quickening of these works is in the interest of both sides.'' The most important is the massacre of nearly 4,500 Polish officers at the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> in World War II. A Polish commission has traced responsibility to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police, but there has been no response from the Soviets. Asked what the limits to Soviet tolerance of changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, `` We do n't set up order in other countries. Would you want it to be so?'' The meeting with <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was followed by a meeting with President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, a Communist. They embraced warmly and posed for photographers before beginning private discussions. During talks with new Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> pledged that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will maintain crucial deliveries of oil and raw materials to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, its largest economic partner in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> provides nearly 85 percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crude oil, 65 percent of its processed petroleum products, and 72 percent of its iron ore. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency his country is interested in an intensification of economic relations with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` Cooperation is simply necessary because the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and Polish economies are complimentary to each other in many spheres,'' he said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said trade with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> represents about 10 percent of his country's total foreign trade, while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> receives about one-third of Polish trade. Both countries are in the midst of economic crisis, but the new Polish government has made a firm commitment to introduce a market economy and is seeking to renegotiate its contacts with its East bloc trading partners.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> plans to purchase 120 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet fighters under a co-production agreement that one senator predicts will spark a `` bitter brawl'' between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration, officials said Wednesday. South Korean Defense Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoon </PERSON> has informed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government will announce its choice between two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighters early next month, said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was told of the decision during a courtesy call at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> last week, said the sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the visit of South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>. The South Koreans will choose between the F @ A-18 Hornet, built by the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or the F-16 Falcon built by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in order to modernize their fleet of aging F-5 fighters. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., an opponent of the co-production plan, said through an aide on Wednesday that the deal could be worth $ 1.8 billion to $ 3 billion The aide said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> foresees a `` bitter, bitter brawl'' between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration over the plan and contends it will cost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs and harm American aerospace and aviation industries. The senator plans to offer a resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to express disapproval of the deal `` as soon as it is official,'' said the aide, who asked not to be identified by name. The Koreans proposed to buy 12 fighters off-the-shelf from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers, assemble 36 from U.S.-supplied kits and then build 72 on their own, an arrangement that has been accepted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundquist </PERSON> confirmed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Korean negotiators `` have agreed to a 12-36-72 mix.'' <PERSON> Lundquist </PERSON> said 12 aircraft will be fully built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 36 will be assembled in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from imported parts and 72 planes will be built in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under the licensed co-production agreement. `` A significant portion of the co-produced aircraft will be produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... At least 70 percent of the program's value will be spent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. During a visit to the Pentagon in July, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the decision on the purchase of the 120 fighters was to be announced in September. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said after that July session that he preferred the Koreans purchase the planes ready-made by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers, but added that the final agreement would `` probably be some blend'' of outright purchase and co-production. The defense secretary added that he was pleased the Koreans had decided to purchase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes over those of other nations.

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s top security official denied lawyers' assertions Wednesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rather than Egyptian investigators uncovered a terror group charged with attacking American and Israeli diplomats. The defense lawyers' goal appeared to be to embarrass Interior Minister <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> and the government. <PERSON> Badr </PERSON>'s rare appearance on a state security court subpoena was to elicit testimony on the investigation of 20 alleged members of an organization calling itself <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution. The defendants are charged with murder, attempted murder and criminal complicity in four shootings between 1984 and 1987 that killed two Israeli diplomats and wounded six Israelis and two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. All 20 defendants were present except <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, eldest son of the late President <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>. He is reportedly living in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Badr's ministry handles <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s internal security. During his 70-minute testimony, <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> denied repeatedly that defendant <PERSON> Essam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> in 1987 to confess and was questioned there for more than two weeks before being surrendered to Egyptian authorities. Defense attorneys contended that before the Americans gave them <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON>, <PERSON> Badr </PERSON>'s investigators had no clue to the terrorist group, whose attacks had greatly embarrassed the government. `` <PERSON> Essam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> told state security authorities that he had information about these cases in the middle of August 1987,'' <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> told the court. `` Authorities checked his story and made their investigations.'' Defense lawyer <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> alleged that President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> formed a committee, which included Badr, to investigate <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution on the basis of information from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy centering on <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON>'s statements `` I am sure that no decision was ever made to create such a committee. Therefore I could not possibly have been a member of it,'' <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> left, <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> testified that he went to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy and made statements to officials there. Embassy spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahba </PERSON> refused comment on the two men's testimony. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> cited purportedly official papers to show that <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> went to the embassy Aug. 15, 1987, and that security authorities were informed of the case Sept. 6. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> said, defendant <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> was able to leave <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on Sept. 10. `` When someone makes an accusation, just an accusation, should I prevent people from traveling abroad without my having proof and without going through the judicial authorities?'' Badr responded. The prosecution has demanded the death penalty for 11 defendants, including <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, who was charged with murder, attempted murder, undermining <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s national security and damaging its relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The remaining nine, among them a nephew of President <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, are charged with complicity and could be sentenced to prison terms of up to 25 years. Eleven defendants are in custody. The rest are free on bail.

<HEAD>Aministration Complains to Moscow About Arms Shipped to Salvadoran
Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration complained to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is still shipping Soviet-bloc arms to Salvadoran rebels, despite repeated Soviet and Nicaraguan denials. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, citing the seizure of a truckload of weapons on the Nicaraguan-Hondran border, called the continued shipments `` a major problem.'' `` We've had an extended dialogue with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about the importance of using their influence to stop that kind of activity,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. At the same time, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> extended for another six months a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> first imposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in mid-1985. In a statement announcing the renewal of the sanctions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation continues to pose `` an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> twice a year on the status of the embargo and on U.S.-Nicaraguan relations. The developments came as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepared for a visit to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, where he and 17 other heads of state _ including <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> _ will join in festivities marking 100 years of Costa Rican democracy. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, briefing reporters on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip, said the president would not meet with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> during the two-day visit that begins Friday. He cited continued clandestine shipments by <PERSON> Oretga </PERSON>'s Sandinista government of East-bloc arms to leftist Salvadoran rebels as one reason why a Bush-Ortega meeting would be `` inappropriate'' `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> clearly continues to ship arms'' to the anti-government rebels, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` It is a major problem that we have called to the attention of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and called to their attention as recently as today,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Asked whether the apparent continued shipments undermine Soviet credibility, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said: `` It is a major stumbling block.'' The Soviets have denied any knowledge of the shipments. The Honduran military last Wednesday seized what officials called a record shipment of weapons being sent from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> through Hondurus to rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the captured weaponry includes 20 AKM assault rifles, with 13 of Soviet manufacture. The remainder were made in other Soviet-bloc countries. The cargo also reportedly included more than 300 rifle grenades, 800 mortar shells, large quantities of Soviet-made hand grenades, 50 other assault weapons or machine guns, large quantities of ammunition, explosives and military radios, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Much of the equipment was wrapped in Nicaraguan newspapers. Also included with the weapons were instruction booklets with `` FMLN'' on the cover, the letters of the Spanish-language name of the Salvadoran `` liberation'' effort. Salvadoran government officials have told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the truck was registered in the name of a `` known <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> front group,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. `` At the very least, the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is not doing what they are telling the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, based on what the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> tells us,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters. Noting that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had recently visited <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said: `` It would appear to me the Nicaraguans are telling them one thing and doing something else,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to see <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government voted out of office in the election next Feb. 25, and contends that election preparations unfairly benefit the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his six-month report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the status of the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> embargo, said `` the trade sanctions are an essential element of our policy that seeks a democratic outcome in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by diplomatic means.'' The embargo bars imports from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and bans <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to that country except to support the Contra rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government. It also prohibits Nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>September Home Sales Hit Highest Level This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of existing homes, responding to lower interest rates, climbed 4.3 percent in September to the highest level this year, a real estate trade group said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units last month following a 4.5 percent sales increase in August. Analysts credited lower mortgage rates for the back-to-back monthly increases in sales, with the lower rates meaning families that had been priced out of the market when rates were rising earlier in the year can now afford homes. At the end of last week, fixed-rate mortgages had dipped back below 10 percent, averaging 9.92 percent, according to a weekly survey conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Last spring, mortgage rates hit a peak of 11.22 percent, reflecting a year-long effort on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to push rates higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures With signs that inflation was easing, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has relented and has been nudging rates lower in response to signs of sluggish economic growth. `` Many people who were forced to put off trading up or entering the market earlier this year are making their move now,'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>, president of the Realtors association. `` With mortgage rates lower during the second half of the year than the first, the market is reaching a broader income range of buyers.'' The national median price for an existing single-family home fell from August to September by $ 1,400 to $ 93,400. The median, or mid-point, price was still 5.5 percent higher than it was a year ago. Analysts attributed the one-month price drop in large part to the fact that the market in September shifts away from larger families to smaller households buying smaller homes. Regionally, the sales advance was paced by a 12.7 percent increase in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 620,000 units in September. Sales were up 3.7 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 1.40 million units, while sales rose 1 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 990,000 units. Sales were unchanged in the Northeast at 590,000 units. This is down 9.2 percent from a year ago. Home sales in the Northeast have been in a slump this year because surging home costs have priced many buyers out of the market. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the Realtors, said that sales in the Northeast have come back slightly from a low-point reached in June and appear to be stabilizing at the current sales pace. `` Housing markets appear to be firming up across the board. We expect that the lower mortgage rates this fall will keep boosting sales in the moderate-price range,'' <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said. The most expensive housing market in September was the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where a median-priced home went for $ 144,800, followed by the West at $ 144,300. The median sales price in the South was $ 84,200 while the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> offered the cheapest housing with a median price of $ 71,800 in September. The national sales pace of 3.63 million units was the fastest clip since homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.92 million units last December.

 Scientists, marine enforcement and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> businesses are pulling together to save the manatee from boaters in a campaign keyed to the mammal's endangered status: `` Miss her now or miss her forever.'' `` I think the slogan has really got a message,'' <PERSON> Vi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> marine research laboratory said Wednesday. `` It's very significant, but you've got to think about it. It does n't jump out and grab you like ` where's the beef?' Marine experts estimate there are probably 1,200 West Indian manatees left in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from as many as an estimated 10,000 a few decades ago. Almost all are in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s coastal waters So far this year through September, 125 have died in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 41 after being struck by boats or barges. Last year 113 deaths were recorded. Aiming to slow this record-setting pace, a multimedia advertising blitz is planned for the time of year when the gentle giant is most vulnerable to boaters. As the temperature drops and the water cools, the lumbering sea cows move into warmer waters near springs or thermal discharges of power plants, thus increasing the risk of contact with boaters. `` The next six months is the most critical time for the manatee,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> HLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION>, which donated work on the campaign and came up with the slogan. The state Cabinet is recommending posting speed limits for boats and the licensing of operators in a two-fold effort to reduce boat-related deaths and to protect manatees. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has 711,000 registered boats. The state had 105 boating-related deaths last year. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and the Cabinet also voted Tuesday to require 13 counties where the manatees are concentrated to decide within 60 days whether to immpose countywide speed limits or adopt more specific plans.

 Sixth-graders and street people shared quarters Wednesday as the upscale <ORGANIZATION> Marina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> reopened for classes even though a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter for 175 earthquake victims remained in the gym and cafeteria. On a sunny morning, students played basketball in the yard while a few feet away scruffy-looking street people walked between temporary metal barricades to breakfast. One man washed his hair using canned water. There was no contact between the mismatched schoolmates. Red Cross officials estimated about half the homeless were displaced residents of the affluent area, while the other half permanently lived on the streets. Some of the fresh-faced students were upset that the homeless were still in the building more than a week after the Oct. 17 quake, even though security is heavy and segregation nearly total. `` It might be disturbing the students,'' said student <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> as he headed into classes. A student who would n't give his name said some children feel they have sacrificed enough by giving up a week of classes so the victims could be housed. With the cafeteria turned over to the homeless, students have to bring bag lunches. Wednesday morning the cafeteria featured an obscenity-filled screaming match between two street people, who had to be separated by security guards. Outside in the yard lay a bundle of filthy clothes. `` It's sort of wierd,'' said one girl, who school officials would not allow to give her name. `` We ca n't get to the gym.'' But administrators said they were happy to help. `` These are people who need the help,'' said Assistant Principal <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Sui </PERSON>. `` Things are going fine.'' He estimated 90 percent of the 950 students were back in classes, in grades six, seven and eight. The school stay was a trip back in time for retired army nurse <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Doss </PERSON>, whose nearby apartment was heavily damaged by the quake. `` It's amazing how much you've grown when you come back to sit in these little seats,'' Ms. <PERSON> Doss </PERSON> said as she ate a breakfast of a banana, orange slices and a turnover. `` This is better food than I've been eating,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who said he normally lives on the street. `` I think there's a spirit that exists in the gymnasium here,'' he said. `` There's a lot of emotional support and hugging.'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials say the shelter will remain open as long as people need it.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will hold hearings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to examine why the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> is reportedly `` awash with drug monies'' being laundered through banks in the region, Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> announced Wednesday. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, said the hearings would be conducted in his hometown of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Dec. 6 and 7 to examine the growing problem of money laundering in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and whether current banking laws are adequate. `` Recent reports show that more cash is flowing into certain <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> financial institutions than is being withdrawn,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Such an influx of cash _ particularly in small bills _ is often an indication that the deposit is the result of an illegal drug sale.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> cited a story in the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American-Statesman </LOCATION> that said the cash surplus in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> vault of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> rose from $ 900 million in 1986 to $ 1.6 billion in 1988. `` Only the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, have larger cash surpluses,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said his committee would ask officials on the `` front lines in the war against drugs'' to discuss the extent of the drug problem and money laundering in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and how local and state law enforcement agencies are cordinating their efforts with federal agencies. Witnesses would also be called from the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said, as the committee attempts to assess the federal government's effectiveness in combatting money laundering activities. The role of financial institutions would also be examined. `` When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Omnibus Drug Initiative Act of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> made sure that the bill contained strong language designed to prevent our nation's banks from being used as Laudromats to launder the ill-gotten gains of drug dealers,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the hearings would look at the role of international bankers in combatting money laundering, and would examine international money trasnfer systems, and attempt to estimate the volume of illegal drug funds worldwide.

<TEXT>
 Former Labor Secretary W.J. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Wednesday stepped into the fray between the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and 1,700 striking miners as the government's super mediator, saying he hopes to provide `` different ideas, different everything'' to bring an end to the 7-month-old walkout. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, tapped by current <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to intervene in the three-state strike, admitted initial reluctance to do so because of the acrimony between the two sides, which have n't bargained directly with one another since the walkout began in April `` This is one that you did n't jump at so quick,'' said <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, a veteran mediator who served as labor secretary in the final year of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration. Still, he said he would get to work immediately and hoped a settlement could be reached by the holidays. He did not say whether he meant Thanksgiving or Christmas. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the decision to appoint a `` super mediator'' was not a sign of disappointment with the federal mediators currently involved in the negotiations. But she said her recent visit with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strikers and her three-way meeting with company Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> had convinced her of the need to name a mediator of greater stature. `` I believe that <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> is precisely the right person,'' she told reporters. Added Usery: `` There comes a time that the parties themselves, the process, needs an additional thrust, needs someone else, needs a different voice, different suggestions, different ideas, different everything. I hope that I'm the person who can bring this to a stop.'' A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, said that, `` although we have not worked with Mr. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> in the past, his integrity and reputation for fairness are very well known and we look forward to working closely with him.'' She said the company resisted the union's efforts to get Usery involved earlier this year `` because we felt at that time that all other bargaining possibilities had not been exhausted.'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, in a statement, said <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> `` is familiar with the industry, has an intimate knowledge of the significance of the issues involved and possesses a reputation for fairness and impartiality. A better choice for mediator could not have been made.'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> urged daily, face-to-face bargaining sessions. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said he had been in touch with <PERSON> Pittson </PERSON>, which had objected to a union request several months ago that <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> be asked to mediate the dispute. `` They called and assured me that they would give me their full cooperation and were hopeful that a resolution would be found,'' he said. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said he would begin private, separate discussions Wednesday with the principals in the dispute and hoped to arrange a face-to-face meeting soon. `` We'll be working at it quite rapidly,'' he said, adding that marathon bargaining sessions were possible once he was up to speed on the issues. Health benefits, particularly those paid to pensioners, have been the major issue dividing the company and its miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Since leaving government, <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> has headed a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> labor relations firm that bears his name. Among the dozens of major strike he has mediated were a six-month strike by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and a three-week strike by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> teachers in 1983. The <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, native was appointed assistant secretary of labor in 1969 and headed the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from 1973 until <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> tapped him for the Cabinet post in 1976.

<HEAD>Alliance Voices Concern over Soviet Short-range Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers urged the Soviets on Wednesday to reduce their short-range nuclear arsenal and cautioned the West against dropping its guard because of the democratic trend in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the other defense chiefs welcomed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s offer of unilateral cuts in conventional forces, but said those would have little effect on the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's nuclear capabilities. In a statement ending a two-day semiannual meeting of the Western alliance's Nuclear Planning Group, the ministers `` called again on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce unilaterally its short-range missile systems to current <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> levels.'' They said the Soviets maintained a `` massive superiority'' in short-range nuclear weapons by updating their systems. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told reporters afterward: `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still possesses enormous military capability. Their strategic capability is more robust today than it was when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power.'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became Communist Party chief in March 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers said the alliance's nuclear warheads in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had been reduced by more than one-third since 1979 to the lowest level in more than 20 years. According to Western estimates, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has 1,450 short-range missile launchers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has 88 Lance launchers, most of them in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promised to withdraw 500 short-range nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this year. Two days after Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> admitted the disputed <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> violates the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, the ministers welcomed the Soviet offer to dismantle it. Their statement stressed `` the importance of full compliance with arms control agreements'' and said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> looked forward `` to the prompt and full implementation of this commitment'' on <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. About democratic reforms spreading through <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said `` there is great uncertainty about how events will unfold in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' and cautioned against a `` euphoric attitude.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s proposal this week during a speech to Soviet legislators of negotiations on disbanding <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied: `` We do n't have a position on their idea. We think <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is important. We expect the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> pact to be in existence for some time. Otherwise, we do n't have any comment.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance was `` even more important now, at this time of manifest change in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself.'' He said Western defense efforts were `` no obstacle at all to improved East-West relations.'' All 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations attended the <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> meeting except <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which does not belong to the alliance's integrated military structure. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, which has no armed forces, was present as an observer.

 <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> vintner <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattui </PERSON> feels contempt for the thief who stole his wine after it fell from a truck whose driver was among those killed in the collapsed <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> freeway. `` Perhaps I can see people stealing something, but when they're stealing under those circumstances, I can think that even a thief might not stoop to do it,'' said <PERSON> Sattui </PERSON>, whose great-grandfather, <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON>, started making wine in 1885 Today, none of the Sattui wine is sold in stores, only at the winery and by subscription. In a rented truck, driver <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> was northbound on the lower roadway of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway when the quake hit. His cargo, headed for shipment to customers, was 70 nine-liter cases of wine from the V. Sattui Winery in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> Sattui </PERSON> nor most of the people from the winery personally knew <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who was a temporary hire for the upcoming holiday season. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s truck was crushed and <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> was killed along with at least 38 others. But four plastic-foam-packed cases of <LOCATION> Sattui </LOCATION> wine, some of it the $ 100-a-bottle 1981 cabernet sauvignon reserve, plummeted 40 feet to the street. For six days, the surviving bottles sat on the street, skirted by rescue workers in the desperate search for survivors from the pancaked tons of concrete and twisted steel. At one point they were gathered and stacked neatly under the freeway, out of the way. They had become an eloquent symbol of priorities amid the death and destruction. Rescuers looked at the wine, but nobody touched it. `` I ai n't thinking about it at all, much less taking it or drinking it,'' a man said the night of the earthquake. `` Besides, it would be wrong, real wrong, to take anything from this horrible place that ai n't yours.'' On the seventh day, Monday, somebody stole the bottles. `` Makes my skin crawl,'' rescue worker <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whoever got it, he can have it. ... I bet some guy thought about that nice wine all week ... temptation finally just got the better of his sense. Deep down, he does n't really want that wine.

 After years of insisting that his name be welded to a law requiring sharp cuts in the federal deficit, Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> wants a divorce from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act. `` I want a divorce because they are using the law as a shield to hide behind, instead of as a sword to spur us in the right direction,'' the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview Wednesday. `` I want a divorce on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable differences,'' he said, abandoning his once-strong campaign to make sure the legislation was referred to as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings instead of just Gramm-Rudman. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> accused his partners in shaping the act, Sens. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, of succumbing to a numbers game in which figures are shifted from column to column, the budget debate is dominated by smoke and mirrors, and the defict goes up, not down. `` I think that's blasphemy,'' he said. `` I need a divorce.'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said that the process actually worked in the first two years after the passage of the defict reduction bill in 1985. `` We cut $ 11.3 billion,'' he said. But then, <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said, an agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House `` started the monkeyshines and the subterfuge.'' `` It was a game of ` anything you can do, I can do better,'' he said. `` And we know it's fraudulent.'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of arguing for truth in budgeting while at the same time `` leading the pack'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to take the bailout of the faltering savings and loan industry out of the budget process. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> complained of the use of other `` tricks and dodges'' to avoid the money bite in the law he helped create. For example, he said that a savings of $ 2.9 billion was claimed by moving a payday at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to Sept. 29 from Oct. 1, placing it in the 1989 fiscal year instead of the current 1990 fiscal year. For a while, he said, the annual deficit actually did turn modestly downward. `` Now we're going up and up; we're not even going in the right direction,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been given the go-ahead to buy up to 16 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain in the year that began Oct. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, acting undersecretary for international affairs and commodity programs, said the clearance to buy more grain resulted from recent communication between the two countries. Under a long-term grain supply agreement, which began its seventh year on Oct. 1, the Soviets are committed to buy at least 9 million tons of wheat and corn each year, with a maximum of 12 million tons allowed without further consultations. If more than 12 million tons are desired, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must give its approval. So far in the 1989-90 year, the Soviets have bought 7.87 million tons of corn, 143,700 tons of soybeans and 430,000 tons of soybean meal. No wheat has been sold yet for delivery in 1989-90, but the agreement specifies that at least 4 million tons must be purchased. Last year the Soviets bought a record of more than 21.7 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the three major commercial television networks unveiled plans Wednesday to air episodes on `` The Cosby Show'' and other popular programs in the hope of getting viewers to volunteer in the fight against hunger and homelessness. The president, surrounded by television stars and network executives at the White House, warmly applauded the initiative. `` The days when TV and the movies glorified violence and drugs and crime are fading,'' the president declared. `` And in place of these negative images, we're seeing a more positive message of caring, of compassion and of hope.'' The networks _ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> _ have agreed to air during the first three weeks of December at least two episodes of six major shows devoted to hunger, homelessness and other problems that volunteers can tackle. The shows, in addition to `` The Cosby Show,'' include `` Cheers,'' `` Murder She Wrote,'' `` Head of the Class,'' `` Thirtysomething'' and `` Designing Women.'' At the end of each show, viewers will be invited to call a toll telephone number to receive for a $ 2 charge a guide to volunteering as well as the phone number of a volunteer center in the caller's area The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> and other organizations are also participating in the project, dubbed `` Prime Time to End Hunger.'' `` In that book, you can find what you can do, where you can go and how you can help,'' said <PERSON> Khristyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Haje </PERSON> of `` Head of the Class,'' one of five performers who joined <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on stage in the Rose Garden. `` It's time _ prime time _ to end hunger and drug abuse and homelessness,'' declared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Television provides a window into the homes of millions of Americans every single night,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` From the comfort of our homes and the company of our families, your shows are going to make us think and think hard about people who are hungry, homeless, those without hope, and how we can help them.'' `` These shows can be catalysts to greater community involvement,'' he said, adding, `` I hope that every TV set in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is tuned in to your shows those first three weeks in December.'' Asked afterwards if they agreed that violence and drugs were `` fading'' from the television screen, actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ark </PERSON> said the industry is toning things down. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ark </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Valenne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> on `` Knots Landing,'' a spinoff from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said, `` They have definitely cut back on <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>'s trip to the bar cart.'' And now, whenver an actor gets into a car, `` the seat belts go on instantly,'' she added. It is important to deliver such messages `` gently,'' she said, and not to `` suddenly pull the plug on violence.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Treatment Of Infant Over Parents' Objections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge granted doctors permission to give blood transfusions to a premature baby Wednesday over the objections of the infant's parents, who oppose the procedure because of their religious beliefs. However, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowengrub </PERSON> said doctors at Our Lady of <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> may only give a transfusion in the event of a medical emergency. And a court-appointed medical guardian will make the decision to give the infant blood if alternative treatments are exhausted, <PERSON> Lowengrub </PERSON> said. The infant has not yet needed a transfusion, but hospital officials sought the order as a precaution after learning of the parents' objections to the procedure. The infant, weighing nearly five pounds, was delivered six weeks prematurely by Caesarean section Sunday. The baby was pale and was kept on a ventilator for the first 48 hours, according to court documents. Neonatal specialists at the hospital said the infant could be at risk because of low blood pressure and a low hemoglobin rate. The hospital even reduced blood sampling to conserve the infant's blood supply, according to Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, chief of the neonatology unit. <PERSON> Lowengrub </PERSON> first signed a temporary order Tuesday allowing doctors to perform blood transfusions if necessary. After a hearing Wednesday, the judge extended his order for the duration of the infant's hospitalization. The parents of the baby boy, identified in court documents only as `` Baby Caban,'' had objected to the procedure, saying it was against their beliefs as <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses to allow the transfusion of blood or blood products into their bodies. Followers of the faith believe transfusions go against the teachings of the Bible, citing a passage of <LOCATION> Leviticus </LOCATION> that reads: `` Whatsoever man ... eats any manner of blood, I will cut him off from among his people.'' `` What they want to do is follow their religious tenets,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> A. Price, the parents' attorney, who would not identify the Willingboro couple. `` They want to be able to make the decision about any medical treatment that they would receive and their child would receive.'' <PERSON> Lowengrub </PERSON>, however, rejected their arguments. `` Parents may choose to become martyrs themselves, but they can not make martyrs of their children,'' the judge said. `` The right to belief is absolute, but the exercise of that belief is not.'' Under <PERSON> Lowengrub </PERSON>'s order, the couple will make all other medical decisions for their child. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, the hospital's attorney, said the hospital has sought similar orders at least twice, but has never had to give transfusions to patients who objected. He said the infant's condition has improved and he may not need a transfusion.

<HEAD>Kennedy Center Chairman Announces Plans to Resign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> announced Wednesday he will resign as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts when his contract expires in February 1991 because of differences with the center's board of trustees. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> executive, took command of the national arts center less than two years ago. He is reported to have drawn complaints from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> board of trustees for being a poor manager and the focus of personality clashes. The 45-member board accepted <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s advance notice of his departure with praise for his `` dedication to the center and his many management and programming initiatives.'' The board refused any further comment beyond its five-paragraph statement. `` I arrived at my decision after several discussions with the board and the realization that we had different priorities and different expectations of each other,'' <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said in a separate statement. `` These differences happen in institutions of all kinds and, as regrettable as they may be, I fully understand the need for a change for the sake of the institution,'' he said. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> did not explain what those differences were. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, 62, was hired in February 1988 to succeed Broadway producer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the founding chairman who officially retired last August after a lengthy transition period. A search committee led by trustee <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was appointed to find a successor to <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, who said he hoped a candidate could be named by mid-1990. Reports of <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s disagreements with the trustees surfaced after the board's last meeting three months ago. The trustees were said to have become increasingly upset by <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>'s aloof management style, his arbitrary treatment of the Kennedy Center staff and his failure to attend important social functions. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier Wednesday that a recent internal poll disclosed that a clear majority of 28 trustees did not want <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> to remain. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> receives $ 125,000 annually as chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the white marble cultural center on the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> which opened in September 1971 as the only official memorial to President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> was reported to have received a $ 4 million `` golden parachute'' when he agreed to take early retirement in 1988 as chairman of the executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, his predecessor at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, served as chairman without salary.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, banished to prison for fleecing his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> followers out of millions of dollars, was `` in good spirits'' Wednesday as he got adjusted to life behind bars, a prison spokesman said. `` He's settling in,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's doing fine.'' Two former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aides known for their fashionable suits and baby crocodile shoes reported to another <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> federal prison to begin serving more than 17 years for tax evasion. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, head bowed and bound hand and foot, arrived at the <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION> prison in eastern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> late Tuesday under the glare of television lights after a six-hour drive from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, where he was sentenced. The founder of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> had no comment for reporters as guards hustled him from a brown sedan to the entrance of the rural, medium-security lockup. Two 15-foot fences topped with razor wire surround the facility. Earlier Tuesday in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to 45 years in prison and fined him $ 500,000 for defrauding thousands of followers of his television ministry. He was ordered to begin serving the long sentence immediately. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was issued an orange jumpsuit and assigned to a two-man cell with bunk beds, a desk, lavoratory and toilet. Prison officials would not reveal his cellmate's identity, other than to say he was `` another lightweight security inmate.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> made some telephone calls Wednesday morning and exercised in an outside yard, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. He would not disclose if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had spoken with his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, or other family members. `` Basically, he's familiarizing himself with unit operations and the institution's rules and regulations,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` He's being supervised in an open-type setting.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and her 13-year-old son did not travel to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s sentencing Tuesday. They were staying with friends in the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> area and she did not make herself available to reporters. The <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s new television ministry in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> has been suspended, but the storefront church they have been running in an <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> shopping mall remains open and is expected to hold Sunday services with Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and guest ministers. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> Wednesday morning to relay numerous media requests for interviews, which <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> referred to his attorney in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The spokesman said no additional security measures were planned during <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s stay at the prison, which often is a first stop for federal prisoners in the Southeast. He is expected to be at the facility for no more than two weeks before he is transferred to another federal prison, which officials would not identify. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was placed in a unit with about 375 other prisoners awaiting assignment, would have to serve at least 10 years in prison before he is eligible for parole unless a planned appeal is successful. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s family and attorneys can visit the defrocked TV evangelist on three evenings during the week and all day on weekends. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> also will be able to attend religious services on Sundays.

 Charges that the police chief stole cocaine stunned city officials, who described him as a warrior against drugs, but a prosecutor told the court the chief admitted using cocaine for five years. `` My first reaction is absolute shock,'' said City Councilor <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. `` He has done a terrific job working on the crime and drug problems in my section of the city.'' Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON>, a 25-year department veteran and a former narcotics officer, pleaded innocent Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Brockton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and was released on his own recognizance. He was suspended from the department with pay until the case is resolved. Sproules, 45, was arrested after a lengthy state police probe linked him to the disappearance of cocaine from the police station's evidence room, said Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Studenski </PERSON>. In Tuesday's court hearing, special prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kivlan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON> `` admitted to investigators, in substance, that over a five-year period, he has been using cocaine on a daily basis.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmands </PERSON>, an attorney for <LOCATION> Sproules </LOCATION>, said his client would not comment on the case. He said the statements attributed to the police chief about drug use were taken out of context, and he called the case `` weak, tenuous at best.'' `` It's a tough time for the family and we're trying to deal with it here,'' he said. <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON> also worked as a soccer coach at <ORGANIZATION> Bridgewater-Raynham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` The kids liked him,'' school Superintendent <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donoghue </PERSON> said. `` He carried out his responsibilities in an exemplary way.'' <PERSON> Sproules </PERSON> has been removed from his coaching duties pending the outcome of the case, <PERSON> O'Donoghue </PERSON> said Wednesday. <LOCATION> Brockton </LOCATION> is a city of 95,000 people 23 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

 Suburban students see <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> as a city of rat-infested, rundown buildings where murder and drug-dealing are rampant. City students see the suburbs as havens of expensive cars, plush homes and spoiled brats. Some of them traded places Wednesday after swapping stories the day before, and both found out how wrong they were. `` They think we all have perfect lives,'' said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Doak </PERSON>, a 17-year-old senior at <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Edsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are drugs in the suburbs, too. You just do n't hear about it.'' Hearing about the differences and learning to recognize and respect them are the aims of the exchange arranged by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an urban coalition founded in 1967 after race riots devastated much of the city. `` The teachers see that the students have a different attitude, just with the one day they spend in another school,'' <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffington </PERSON>, a race relations consultant who organized the program, said Wednesday. The New Detroit exchange program was started four years ago to promote intercultural harmony and slow racial prejudice among teen-agers. Students, chosen to participate through a variety of methods, say some of their biggest misconceptions come from home. `` My parents do n't know both sides, and I think I can help them see that <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is n't what they think it is,'' <PERSON> Aliza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlberg </PERSON>, a 17-year-old senior at <ORGANIZATION> Southfield-Lathrup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said after Tuesday's session at <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, from the <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clemens </ORGANIZATION>, said students find a conflict between what they learn at sessions like Tuesday's and what they hear at home. `` It's tough for them because a lot of their parents are trying to socialize them in different beliefs,'' <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> said. In Tuesday's sessions, students from the city and outlying suburbs formed groups of 30 and played games designed to raise consciousness to racial equality. One game required students from suburbs to draw their impressions of the city while students from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> drew their concepts of the suburbs. `` I get upset that people think you're a charity case if you come from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a 17-year-old <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> resident and senior at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in fashionable <PERSON> Grosse </PERSON> <PERSON> Pointe </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` They think that you have only one parent and live in a slum.'' Participants in this week's program, one of two held each school year, were 354 students and 48 teachers.

 Residents of a southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> community on Wednesday mourned the death of a baby whale that it adopted three months ago after the creature took refuge in a local cove with its mother. But fishermen in the village of <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lavapie </LOCATION> reacted differently _ they butchered the 26-foot-long right whale `` Tomito,'' or <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>, for food after it died Monday in <LOCATION> Arauco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` All Arauco is hurting,'' the local governor, <PERSON> Eugenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cofre </PERSON>, was quoted as saying Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Segunda </ORGANIZATION>. The whale and its mother arrived in July at the cove near <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lavapie </LOCATION>, 360 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, residents said. <PERSON> Punta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavapie </PERSON>, a village of about 200 families, adopted the whales, which are large-headed with wrinkles on the throat and chest, and nicknamed them `` Tomito'' and `` Ema.'' Thousands of tourists visited the warm-water cove along with marine biologists. The scientists said the newborn whale was being nurtured until it was big enough to endure the rigors of a migratory trip to <LOCATION> Antartica </LOCATION> for feeding. But the whale was found dead on a rocky beach Monday, according to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspapers. The cause of death was unclear, but some newspapers said it may have been slashed by a fishing boat's propeller The newspapers carried photographs Wednesday of fishermen carving up the whale with long kitchen knives. The mother remained offshore, frantically diving and surfacing, the newspapers reported. Chilean naturalists said they planned to investigate the cause of death. They said local authorities should have provided more protection for the whales.

 Two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> plan a trip to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to urge <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to accept a proposed peace plan, despite warnings from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that their security can not be guaranteed, sources said Wednesday. Reps. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, both of Lebanese-American descent, are seeking a meeting with Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army who has withheld his acceptance of the proposal to end the country's 14-year civil war, the They spoke only on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>'s office declined to discuss his trip, saying `` we can neither confirm nor deny it, for security reasons.'' A spokesman for Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> said he could not obtain information about her plans. The White House, meanwhile, rejected any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempt to influence <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. `` That's ... an internal matter for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the various factions there to deal with,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did discuss the prospects for peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in telephone calls Monday and Tuesday with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed hope the plan `` would be a step in the direction of Lebanese reform,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The plan, adopted by 63 Lebanese legislators after three weeks of closed-door meetings in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, would shift political control from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority to the Moslem majority in an attempt to end the country's 14-year civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who declared a `` war of liberation'' in March to drive the 40,000 Syrian troops from the country, called on the Lebanese lawmakers to reject the plan when it comes up for a vote next month because it fails to set a deadline for a Syrian pullout. Oakar and <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> are no strangers to the dangers of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In 1982 they visited <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at the height of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> invasion to offer their support for the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people and condemn the fighting. But <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the situation now is far more dangerous because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has been evacuated and the two lawmakers would be completely dependent for their security on their Lebanese hosts. `` We do n't oppose their talking to him -LRB- <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> -RRB-, but we ca n't offer any support or help if they get in trouble,'' said one official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> guidelines prohibit travel by Americans to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in most cases. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is so dangerous that no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen can be considered safe from terrorist acts,'' according to the guidelines. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passports are invalid for travel to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> unless special permission is obtained. Violation of this ban can be punishable by imprisonment or a fine, the guidelines say. There are eight Americans missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, all believed to have been kidnapped in the past five years by pro-Iranian radicals. The embassy was evacuated last month after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> made veiled threats to take American hostages in order to draw attention to his fight for expulsion of the Syrians.

 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> can not accommodate much longer 43,000 Vietnamese boat people who mainly are economic refugees, Britich Foreign Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It is soon going to be necessary to tackle the thorny problem of involuntary repatriation,'' Major told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in response to a question about the refugees in the British colony. `` It is not reasonable to accept that they will have to stay in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> forever and I can not _ and will not _ accept that.'' `` We are seeking to cajole and persuade the Vietnamese boat people to return, but I now have to recognize that the problem in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is acute and getting worse and can not be borne much longer,'' Major said. Some legislators of the governing Conservative party and the Labor opposition expressed concern over Major's comments. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign affairs spokesman, said the refugees left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because the country was poor and that they had to be dealt with in a humanitarian way. `` I think if we are going to have a solution which is humane yet effective ... economic aid to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on a substantial scale has got to be part of the answer,'' he told Channel 4 News. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, a Conservative, said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> should help improve life in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` Unless we can do that many of us will have grave concerns about repatriation,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that the 13,000 Vietnamese who arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> before 1988 qualified for refugee status because of religious or political persecution. However, the vast majority of the 43,000 Vietnamese who have arrived since June 1988 are expected to be disqualified on grounds they left their homeland only to seek a better living elsewhere, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Only 386 refugees have agreed to return home from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> voluntarily since September 1988, he said.

 Five college presidents signed an agreement Wednesday to work together to increase the representation of blacks, Hispanics and other minorities in the teaching profession. Under the agreement, the institutions will work with local high schools with large minority student bodies to identify 550 students in grades nine through 12 with potential to develop the self-confidence and sense of achievement essential for good teachers. A `` Memorandum of Understanding and Intent'' was signed by the presidents of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xavier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hostos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, and two institutions of the <ORGANIZATION> Ana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mendez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turabo </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said the high school students will move through a rigorous four-year program of Saturday and summer courses, including field trips and university visits. They will receive guidance in choosing a college or university and help in seeking financial backing through scholarships, loans and grants. The students' college programs will include special seminars and workshops, student exchange programs, and hands-on teaching experience. Students in two-year colleges will be urged to go on to four-year institutions, and outstanding students will be encouraged to enter masters or doctorate programs. `` We have selected a clear goal: to develop a major, comprehensive and collaborative model program to increase the number and enhance the preparation of minority elementary and secondary school teachers,'' said the agreement. `` We propose to accomplish this by pooling resources whenever appropriate and necessary and carrying out joint programs that can serve as model for institutions nationwide.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a bill to provide abortion assistance to impoverished victims of rape and incest was sustained in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday as a 231-191 vote to override him fell 51 votes short of the necessary two-thirds margin. Though narrow in scope, the bill carried symbolic importance in the widening political struggle over the abortion issue, and proponents took their loss with a vow to keep the president's feet to the fire. But Rep. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, called it `` a decisive victory for the pro-life movement.'' `` The president won a legislative victory today with use of a legislative minority,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore. `` He will put his party at tremendous risk in the next election, and some of his allies on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor will not be returned. A Republican, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who supported the bill, said `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may well have stumbled on the one issue that could cost him re-election.'' The vote, in which 42 Republicans joined 189 Democrats in the unsuccessful bid to enact the bill over the president's veto, left intact an 8-year-old ban of federal financing of abortions for poor women, except when their lives are threatened. `` We're pleased,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` It shows strong support for the president's position.'' The disputed provision would have permitted Medicaid abortions for women who are victims of rape or incest, and who `` reported promptly'' to authorities. It was part of a spending bill that now goes back to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations Committee for revision. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and other abortion opponents said the vote demonstrated they can overcome future efforts to weaken the prohibition on most Medicaid abortions, adding that it shows the political ground has not shifted in favor of abortion rights, as some political strategists argue. `` They made the mistake of thinking this was a one-round fight,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. `` Some members who were panicked by pro-abortion propaganda in the last few weeks are going to be surprised, because the final tale has n't been told on how this issue is cutting more liberal language had passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although it had easily cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Abortion-rights supporters picked up a net 15 votes on the override vote. But some of those who switched positions said they did so for other reasons, since the vote affected the entire $ 156.7 billion spending bill. Fifty-nine Democrats and 132 Republicans voted to sustain the veto. Eleven members did not vote, including Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, a Republican who running for governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and who has been accused of waffling on the abortion issue. His opponent, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, voted to override and later said <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> `` chose to say this was not an issue of enough importance to adjust his schedule to be here.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the anti-abortion leader, attributed most of the switches to other issues but said there were `` a few marginal members who have capitulated.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said Democrats had not decided on their next move House Democratic Whip <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., said he did not think Democrats would attempt to add similar abortion language again to the same appropriations bill Leaders of the move to liberalize Medicaid abortions held out that possibility, however, and said in any event they would raise the issue repeatedly by attempting to add similar language to other bills. `` We will keep coming back,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif.

 Rescue workers Wednesday dug through tons of dirt and debris from a landslide that buried a <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> shantytown, killing at least three people, injuring dozens and leaving at least 90 missing. However, officials said they had little hope of finding survivors from Tuesday's accident, which occurred after a 100-foot-high hill of dirt from construction sites collapsed at the Nova Republica slum. Fire Department Maj. <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Carchedi </PERSON> said shantytown community leaders estimated more than 90 people were missing. `` But that does not mean they are all dead,'' <PERSON> Carchedi </PERSON> said, `` because we are sure that many of those unaccounted for are in temporary shelters.'' `` We may never know how many people were killed,'' he added. At least three people died and dozens of slum dwellers were injured Tuesday evening in the landslide, fire officials said. `` We heard a loud roar and the ground shook and we ran for the door,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Prazeres </PERSON>, a survivor, said in a televised interview. `` We just had time to move before the walls came crashing down on us.'' A total of 56 wood and brick shacks were buried, Lt. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenorio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Albuquerque </PERSON> of the fire department said. `` The chances of finding anyone still alive beneath all this rubble are extremely remote, but we will continue searching because we can never give up hope,'' <PERSON> Carchedi </PERSON> said. Several of the shacks were buried underneath 45 feet of dirt, <PERSON> Carchedi </PERSON> said. Firemen, policemen, civil defense workers and volunteers using bulldozers, backhoes, shovels and in many cases their bare hands worked nonstop Wednesday digging through mud in search of victims. Four specially trained police dogs scoured the area looking for survivors. <PERSON> Carchedi </PERSON>, a rescue coordinator, said three bodies had been pulled out and that about 20 people were treated for injuries at an emergency treatment center set up near the slum. Survivors at the scene said about 400 people lived in 100 shacks in the neighborhood. The landfill was made of dirt excavated from construction sites around the city and illegally dumped next to the shantytown, said <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. He said the earth was loose and slid away because of underground streams that eroded its base. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON>, a geologist of the <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, surveyed the area and estimated about 600,000 tons of earth collapsed.

 Defense efforts to move the trial of a police officer charged in the fatal shooting of a black motorcylist suffered a setback Wednesday when the judge cut off the hearing and resumed screening jurors. Lawyers for Colombian-born <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> contend he can not get a fair trial on two manslaughter charges in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because jurors might fear that an innocent verdict would touch off rioting. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s shooting of <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, who was being chased by police, led to three days of racial violence in January. The suspended officer is also charged in the death of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, killed in the subsequent crash <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> tried to run him over and he fired in self-defense. Some witnesses disputed his account and called the shooting unwarranted. The January riot was the fourth related to police slayings of black men in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> during the 1980s; two disturbances followed acquittals of officers. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> had sharply limited the documents and witnesses defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> could use to request the change of venue, and on Wednesday, after they were submitted, indicated he was in no hurry to rule on the issue. He cut off the defense presentation, and spent the rest of Wednesday completing preliminary screening of a pool of more than 220 potential jurors. `` There very well may be post-trial difficulties,'' said <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>. `` But we do n't need individuals testifying to that.'' The case was recessed until Monday, when questioning of jurors will continue. The questioning of jurors, with 15 minutes per side for each potential juror, could take three weeks, attorneys said. Out-of-town depositions are being taken the rest of the week. `` Clearly we're disappointed,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said outside the courtroom. `` It's unfair to have a trial with jurors who are concerned with something other than guilt or innocence.'' Prosecutors has sought to quash <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s subpoenas, but did not dispute the threat of violence in case of acquittal. `` There is a degree of probability that a riot will occur,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney. Black had also fought for a change of venue in the case of officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, who in 1984 was acquitted in the 1982 video arcade shooting of <PERSON> Nevell </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Both the slaying and the innocent verdict led to disturbances. But the attorney said the situations are different. `` The atmosphere in this courthouse and the atmosphere in the community are far worse this time,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Wednesday further sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be inappropriate now because of steps the country's new government is taking toward the black majority. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he refused to `` choose sides'' in the Commonwealth dispute in which <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> refused to go along with a call by other <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> leaders for further sanctions. Instead, he reiterated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committed to ending apartheid by assisting blacks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> economically and politically and would work through diplomcy to resolve conflicts. `` We're going to continue to work with our allies to support change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and we're going to try and continue to work with -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to develop a bipartisan approach,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He said action taken by President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and his government in recent weeks `` is clearly a step in the right direction, and I think that that step argues for continued patience with respect to the question of further sanctions.'' `` I think it would be inappropriate now to move forward with further sanctions in the light of the efforts of that new government _ obvious efforts of that new government to move in the right direction,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did n't refer specifically to steps taken by the <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> government such as freeing of imprisoned black leaders and permitting anti-apartheid demonstrating.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will send a delegation to a conference on global warming next month in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, but is not prepared to commit itself to action against the problem, officials said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, who will head the delegation, said the administration's policy on global warming has yet to be worked out. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said it is premature to call for a commitment to freeze emissions by the year 2000 of the `` greenhouse'' gases. These are gases whose accumulation in the atmosphere is, according to most scientists, warming the globe. The Dutch government is expected to propose such a freeze of carbon dioxide emissions at the 68-nation conference Nov. 6-7 near The Hague. Carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, is the principal warming gas. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised during his election campaign last year to convene a similar international conference on global warming, but nothing has been done. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, in a meeting with reporters, did not discuss the president's campaign promise. The administration reportedly has been divided on how aggressive a role the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should assume in confronting global warming. According to administration sources, it was not clear until earlier this week that <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> actually would go to the conference which will be attended by environmental ministers from the around the world. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Flavin </PERSON>, an expert on global warming issues for <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an environmentally oriented research group, said the flap over whether <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> would attend the conference was seen by many <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> officials as further indication that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not prepared to lead the effort to deal with global warming. `` This is a major meeting ... It's been in the planning stage for better part of a year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> just does n't have its act together,'' said <PERSON> Flavin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Flavin </PERSON> said that most European governments favor specific commitments for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to administration sources who have discussed the question on condition they not be identified, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> has championed a more aggressive response to the global warming concern and has favored taking specific proposals to the meeting in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Others in the administration, including the president's science adviser, <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>, have cautioned against moving too quickly. They argue there has yet to emerge a clear scientific consensus on the impact of the so-called greenhouse effect, nor have the economic ramifications of a curb on the burning of fossil fuels been made clear. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> refused to discuss the internal disagreements within the administration. He told reporters that `` a whole range of questions'' remain about global warming and how to respond. These questions should be answered before the administration decides on specific commitments for curbing greenhouse pollutants, he suggested.

 The secret police will disband undercover units and turn off listening devices to try to win `` public acceptance and prestige,'' and a place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s reforms, commanders said Wednesday. Freed from watching opposition activists _ many now hold posts in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist government _ security forces can turn to fighting an alarming rise in property crimes spawned by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, the officials said. `` The functionaries of the security service not only fully accept these changes, but are aware that the changes are irreversible,'' said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpacz </PERSON>, deputy chief of the secret police. `` If any are found with a different view, they will have to leave the force,'' he said. <PERSON> Karpacz </PERSON> was joined by the deputy commander of the police and the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> at a news conference that opened the secret department to unusual scrutiny. `` It is obvious that the understanding, interpretation and realization of the job of ... the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> depends directly on the broader social and political conditions of the country,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON>. `` That is why there will be changes _ perhaps the deepest in postwar history _ in the way some responsibilities in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> will be implemented,'' <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said. The despised secret police long symbolized communist control by fear. They are remembered as executors of Stalinist purges, clandestine monitors of the opposition and interrogators of activists. Three rogue officers and their commander from the so-called `` Fourth Department,'' which spied on religious associations, were convicted of the 1984 kidnapping and murder of the Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, a charismatic Solidarity priest whose bound body was dumped in a river. The fourth department and five other units, including those responsible for surveillance of citizens' loyalty and protection of the agricultural, manufacturing and arms industries, have been liquidated in the reform drive, <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said. Also dissolved are `` archaic'' units that inspected foreign mail for secret messages and monitored foreign radio transmissions, <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said, along with the political education unit. There will be `` much less frequent'' use of secret observation, wiretapping and eavesdropping, and only with the permission of the court or the prosecutor's office, he said. `` The most radical changes will be in the secret police. The tasks of protecting internal security in the case of a parliamentary democracy and political pluralism has to be understood and executed in an essentially different manner from the past,'' <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said. `` As long as any opposition was illegal, it was treated as a threat. Since the considerable majority of the opposition ... has become legal ... its representatives are in the parliament ... they have ceased to be an object of interest to the secret police,'' he said. Three new secret police units will be formed. One will protect the constitutional order against political extremists and terrorists who `` do not want to become legal'' under new freedoms, another will safeguard the economy against espionage and disruption and the third will analyze security information and work on crime prevention, <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said. With <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` still the object of increased interest from foreign intelligence services,'' counterintelligence efforts will be strengthened, <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> siad. Acknowledging an expansion of the secret police ranks over the years, <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said the department will be limited to 7 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, or about 7,500 posts. Greater importance will be put on public safety and protecting property, <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said, and some secret police officers will be transferred to help with a national alert issued to combat an `` alarming'' rise in thefts and burglaries. There are about 1,250 crimes per 100,000 people annually, which <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said was relatively low by Western standards, but increasing incidents of car break-ins and other crimes are being reported as the economic situation worsens and the division between the well-to-do and the impoverished widens. The 12,500-member paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> ZOMO </ORGANIZATION> riot police, disbanded in a symbolic move Sept. 29, will be replaced by `` prevention squads'' of 5,177 officers in 22 of the 49 provinces. They will be supplemented by 13,000 men serving in the police as an alternative to mandatory military duty, <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials were questioned about confiscations of once-banned underground publications, the privileges supposedly provided to security forces and what would happen to the information gathered through surveillance. They said material confiscated but not destroyed following court procedures might be returned if proper application was made. As the secret police units were disbanded, `` all the resources were listed and in cases in which analyses were not useful, they were destroyed,'' <PERSON> Karpacz </PERSON> said. He denied that a special unit existed to monitor foreign journalists but would not answer directly whether their offices and homes were bugged. Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, one of four remaining communists in the 24-member Solidarity-led cabinet, has recommended that the prime minister create an advisory committee representing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political forces `` to deepen society's control of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Garstka </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officers were brought together this month for a two-day seminar during which <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> gave a lecture on how they should work `` in the new conditions,'' the spokesman said. `` Acting in a responsible and cautious way, according to law, with professionalism, openly informing society about their actions and problems, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is going to strive for public acceptance and prestige,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Wednesday protested a call by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> for creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland. `` We can not but express the deep feeling of disappointment over the statement made by the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and our hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and those leading it would finally conduct a soul-searching regarding the political reality of these days,'' said Minister <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, who is responsible for Arab affairs. He made his statement in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the Israeli Cabinet. `` The pope spoke about the difficult conflict which is torturing for all of us and mentioned ` another people' in a style reminiscent of past relations with the Church that we considered long gone,'' <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> said. In a brief speech Sunday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> expressed solidarity with Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, who have been rebelling against Israeli rule the past 22 months. `` From the Holy Land come calls for help and solidarity from the inhabitants of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` They are the cries of an entire people which today is particularly tired and feels weaker after decades of conflict with another people linked to the same land by their history and their faith.'' He added: `` I would like to express to these people my most profound solidarity, assuring them that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> continues to make his own their legitimate request to live in peace in a country of their own, respecting the rights of every other people to enjoy the necessary security and tranquility.'' The statement did not specifically mention the Jewish people or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with which the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has no diplomatic relations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposes formation of an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, fearing it would threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and other right-wing parties view the occupied territories as an integral part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> last year declared <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> as an independent state without giving specific boundaries. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist group. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s adviser <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, reacting to the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s statement, was quoted Monday by the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> as saying: `` The pope's concern for a homeland for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> is very peculiar in light of the fact that despite the 40 years of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has yet to recognize or show the same concern for the homeland of the Jewish people.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that a court decision allowing former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s papers to be subpoenaed for an Iran-Contra trial `` raised a serious question'' about the institution of the presidency. Comments by chief spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> appeared to signal that top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were studying the possibility of supporting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in any challenge to subpoenas for notes and diaries for use as evidence by former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> emphasized that the department has not formulated a position on Tuesday's ruling by the trial judge in <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s case and would n't do so without consulting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s private attorney, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> But the spokesman said the ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> `` does raise a serious question about the institution of the presidency.'' `` The judge's decision would allow for the subpoenaing of material from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that dealt with discussions he had when he was president,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` We intend to take a look at that.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> refused to discuss in more specific detail the nature of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s reaction to <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s ruling. Asked if the department was considering a claim the papers are protected by executive privilege, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said only: `` The possibilities are wide, I expect.'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> declined to comment about whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would resist subpoenas. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is accused of obstructing various congressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair. He contends that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s diaries and notes taken during their frequent meetings will show that the former president authorized many of his actions in the Iran-Contra affair <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> held that if such diaries and notes contain relevant information, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is entitled to subpoena them for use as evidence at the trial, set to begin Jan. 22. Among other things, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> contends that he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> discussed a false chronology of the administration's arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that is the subject of four of the charges against the former national security adviser. In his request for documents, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> cited notes taken by the former president and others during his meetings with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as well as presidential diaries. Prosecutors for independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> were allowed to read and take notes from typewritten extracts of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s diaries that were prepared by the White House. The diaries remain in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s custody and he claims they are his personal property, according to filings in the case. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s attorneys may issue subpoenas for documents kept by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. The subpoenas would be returnable by Nov. 23. The judge refused to authorize <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> to subpoena similar records from then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Under the Presidential Records and Materials and Preservation Act, a former president may invoke executive privilege to prevent the archives from releasing certain papers. The law, however, does not extend this privilege to subpoenas for material needed as evidence in a criminal trial. Moreover, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> unanimously ruled in 1973 that then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> could not invoke executive privilege to withhold tape recordings of his Oval Office conversations for use as evidence in the Watergate prosecutions. The high court ruled that although a president has an executive privilege over his papers, it can not be invoked to prevent use of papers deemed relevant to a criminal trial.

 Investors on Wednesday snapped up the first of what will be $ 30 billion in special government bonds sold to finance the savings and loan bailout. Buyers bid an average yield of 8.15 percent on $ 4.52 billion in 30-year bonds issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, called Refcorp. The premium over regular <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> 30-year bonds, which yielded 7.88 percent on Wednesday, was 0.27 percentage points, about what <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were expecting. Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said investors demand the premium because the government guarantee of interest payments on the Refcorp bonds is not as strong as the full faith and credit guarantee given direct government borrowing. `` Considering all of that, I think it was really well bid for. The bonds were really well received and came in at about the spread expected,'' he said. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the government borrowed $ 20 billion for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls directly. The complex funding compromise put together by the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> calls for an additional $ 30 billion in borrowing through Refcorp by Sept. 30, 1991. Regular quarterly auctions are planned. The Refcorp bonds, which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration favored, have the advantage of keeping $ 30 billion out of the federal budget deficit. However, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that if the interest rate difference holds at 0.27 percentage points, taxpayers will wind up spending $ 2.43 billion extra for that accounting maneuver.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> delivered a $ 65 million check for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> dues Wednesday, a day later than intended. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> check was meant to be a birthday gift delivered Tuesday on United Nations Day, commemorating 44 years since the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter came into force on Oct. 24, 1945. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent an envelope that was to have included the check Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, but someone forgot to include the check, an official said. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> instead had to wait another day for the $ 65 million check, said the official, who was familiar with the mix-up and spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in mid-October that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had only $ 68 million in its General Fund, barely enough to meet expenses through the end of the month. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member most in arrears. Before the latest payment, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> owed more than $ 495 million to the regular budget and $ 200 million more for peacekeeping activities. The $ 65 million will be applied to the 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues of $ 216 million. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s annual budget is about $ 776 million. Beginning in 1985, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began withholding some of its the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues to protest what it said was the organization's anti-Western bias, inefficiency and budget overruns.

 Residents and merchants are still rebuilding their lives and businesses two years after the <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION> Narrows earthquake, painting a sobering forecast for cities heavily damaged in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> quake. Patience, care and drive are the virtues earthquake veterans here recommend for the communities in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> region and south to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that were jolted Oct. 17 by an earthquake that registered 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. `` The recovery effort is a function of the spirit of the people affected by the disaster,'' said <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauk </PERSON>. Once the community comes out of shock, plans for rebuilding must be made right away, he said. `` It takes a longer time than anybody thinks,'' <PERSON> Mauk </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot to do and the key is you've just got to run and sprint through it.'' Speed should be tempered by organization and care for those going through the process of applying to government agencies for loans and grants and looking for building contractors, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, manager of the building rehabilitation department and code enforcement. `` You always have opportunists,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately some of those opportunists are what they call contractors.'' The 5.9-magnitude earthquake of Oct. 1, 1987, and a 5.3-magnitude aftershock three days later caused more than $ 350 million damage in greater <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, including more than $ 78 million damage to suburban <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>. About 5,000 homes and businesses were damaged. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, which was badly damaged in last week's quake, is `` looking at from two to four years before everything is put back together. `` It's just a massive undertaking,'' he said. `` I'm still running very, very skinny,'' saidAnthony <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who operates a bicycle shop in <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION> that's located next door to a two-story building laced with earthquake cracks and surrounded by a chain-link fence. `` It's not a positive thing having that building next door,'' he said. Most evidence of the quakes _ collapsed walls, shattered glass and toppled chimneys _ has long since been cleared away, and the town of 73,000 bustles with traffic and shoppers. But it is clear that repairs and replacement of what was lost will go on for years. The battered Whittier Theater still slumps in the ruins of its facade and a boarded-up supermarket waits behind a chain-link fence for wreckers to finish what the earthquake began nearly 25 months ago. A pancaked parking structure at the Whittier Quad shopping center is gone, along with a multi-story department store that was the centerpiece, but new stores have yet to take shape on the freshly graded land. A dozen lots remain empty in the quaint <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> business district, some behind fences bearing optimistic slogans: `` Toward the Future,'' `` Better than Ever'' and `` Developing With Beauty.'' About 30,000 people visited assistance centers in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION> quake. More than 14,000 applicants got grants for home repairs from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approved 8,400 loan applications totaling about $ 150 million.

<HEAD>Libyans Barred From Entering Italy for `Day of Mourning'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police on Wednesday blocked more than 800 Libyans who arrived by boat to mark a `` day of mourning'' declared by Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> for Libyans deported during Italian colonial rule. The Libyan cruise ship <PERSON> Garnata </PERSON> arrived in port but police barred the passengers from disembarking because they lacked entrance visas, Italian officials said. The Libyans held up huge photos of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and signed a statement addressed to the Italian government saying they had made a `` voyage of peace'' to visit the graves of relatives. Authorities said 846 Libyan passengers were on board. Libyan representatives met with Italian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials in an attempt to get the Libyans into <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, but there was no change in the situation by late Wednesday. Italian news agencies, quoting unidentified sources in the premier's office, said the Libyans would not be allowed into the country. There was no immediate official confirmation. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, as in other years, set aside Thursday as a day of mourning for Libyans deported to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> during colonial rule from 1911 to the end of World War II. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says at least 4,000 Libyans were deported and that Oct. 26 is the 78th anniversary of the first deportations to remote Italian islands. The Libyans on board the cruise ship planned to visit the graves of relatives and take part in demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and other cities on Thursday. `` If they do n't get the permits to enter <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, they will go back to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalgam </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said authorities had agreed to allow about 200 Libyans to come by plane but were taken by surprise when <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> sent the ship to <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> with 800 people aboard. `` When 800 people arrive at a single port without visas, even if you wanted to allow them to enter it would take days,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity as is customary. About 170 Libyans with valid visas did arrive by plane and traveled to the tiny Italian island of <LOCATION> Ustica </LOCATION> to visit a cemetery where Libyan deportees were buried. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> quoted one of the Libyan crew members aboard the ship as saying, `` They are all without visas because they did n't have time to apply for them. It usually takes a month to get them from the Italian embassy, but the trip was arranged only a week ago.'' All flights and international telecommunications will be halted in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> for 12 hours Thursday in observance of the day of mourning, the official Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this week. The day is part of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s persistent demand that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> pay reparations for its colonial occupation. The Italian government, however, says <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> met its obligations with payment of an idemnity of 1.5 million British pounds, at the time worth $ 6.7 million, under a 1956 agreement with the then Libyan monarchy. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> deposed the monarchy in a 1969 coup.

But <PERSON> McNary </PERSON> refused to say which of the many criticisms of <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Momboisse </LOCATION>'s 22-page memo he considered to be valid. `` I appreciate the memo,'' <PERSON> McNary </PERSON> said. `` He was in a key position, so his ideas, even though they might be biased, are ideas from an insider. I have read the memo and probaby will read it again.'' The new commissioner, who has not been formally sworn into office, said he wanted to centralize the operations of <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, which was criticized earlier this year in a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> audit that found mismanagement and waste. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> ended the last fiscal year with an estimated $ 30 million deficit, which one source said resulted from the decentralization of agency operations under <PERSON> McNary </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. <PERSON> McNary </PERSON>'s comments about the drainage ditch, which has drawn opposition from Hispanic organizations and the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government, indicated the government may scrap plans to build it.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call For Counsumer Boycott of Drift Net Caught Tuna</HEAD>

 Two lawmakers called Wednesday for a nationwide consumer boycott of canned tuna imported from countries whose fishing fleets use drift nets. Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, D-Ore., and Eni F.H Faleomavaega, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>'s non-voting delegate to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also urged consumers not to purchase tuna from nations whose canneries process fish supplied by the drift-net fleets. <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said it was his understanding that virtually all of the canned tuna imported from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> contained fish caught by the drift-net fleets of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> was the `` principal processor'' of such fish. All imported tuna is required to bear the country of origin on its label, although <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said such labeling was often in fine print. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the only major market for canned tuna, importing almost $ 250 million of drift-net-caught tuna just last year,'' <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said. `` I think American consumers would be willing to pay a few cents more for a can of tuna in order to force these nations to stop using drift nets. `` I have yet to meet an American family that thinks it is a good idea to strangle dolphins and other animals in drift nets.'' <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said about 30 percent of the canned tuna sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is imported. `` The American market has enormous economic clout and can force a change in these fishing technologies,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Leape </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative director for ocean ecology issues. A <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, however, said later in the day the environmental group was not actually calling for a boycott. `` We are not opposed to a boycott, but would prefer that things be done legislatively,'' said <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Palese </PERSON>. `` Boycotts are not the answer, there are better ways to do things. We tell people if they want to avoid buying tuna, that's fine. But it is hard for consumers to understand what tuna to buy or not to buy.'' Last week, <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> introduced legislation that could lead to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ban on fish imports from nations known to use drift nets or to process drift-net catches. `` We need to hit them in their pocketbooks,'' <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> told a news conference, adding that drift-net fleets were `` effectively strip-mining'' the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> of both tuna and salmon. <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said the small-mesh, monofilament nets also kill thousands of marine mammals, sea birds and other marine animals annually. `` Every night these nations drop 30,000 miles of net _ a virtual wall of death that could encircle the entire globe,'' <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said. `` If this continues for a few more years, we will have a beautiful, shimmering biological desert off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has agreed to support a temporary moratorium on drift-net fishing on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, but has been reluctant to seek a similar ban in either the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> or internationally. The administration earlier this summer reached separate enforcement and monitoring agreements with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials hope will supply adequate scientific data for the administration to decide whether to seek an international ban. <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said further studies were not needed and `` we do not have time for lengthy negotiations.''

<HEAD>Iran, Saudi Arabia Lash Out at Critics of Their Death Penalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> on Wednesday lashed out at <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> for complaining of human rights abuses in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, calling the group a Western `` tool.'' In <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, Saudi officials were quoted as saying criticism of the kingdom's use of the death penalty is anti-Islamic. London-based Amnesty has taken <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> officials to task over the issue. In its annual global survey of human rights released Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said 142 executions had been announced by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last year. However, it said it had learned of at least 1,700 secret executions. The rights group, which opposes capital punishment, issues periodic lists of people executed or jailed for political reasons. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as saying that <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> `` issues lists now and then for fun, to impress other nations and discourage them from sympathizing with the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.'' `` In their propaganda, our enemies refer to drug traffickers as political dissidents,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said at a gathering in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. By its own figures, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has executed more than 1,000 purported drug traffickers since December. Amnesty and some other independent rights groups believe many political prisoners have been hanged as drug smugglers. `` All this propaganda is aimed at marring the image of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>,'' the Iranian news agency quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as saying. In an interview distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, Interior Minister Prince <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> was quoted Wednesday as stressing that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is a theocratic state ruled by Islamic law. `` These are laws from God inspired to His Prophet -LRB- <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> -RRB-,'' he was quoted as saying. Under that law, Islamic courts may prescribe beheading by the sword and crucifixion for those convicted of heresy or murder, the chopping off of hands and feet for thieves, and stoning for adulterers. In <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, convicted murderers are routinely beheaded in public squares in front of mosques after Friday prayers. While the interview did not specifically mention Amnesty, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s beheading of 16 Moslem Shiites of <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> nationality last month brought condemnation by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> and other groups. The 16 were convicted by Islamic courts of planting bombs at the height of the Islamic pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> on July 10. One Pakistani pilgrim was killed, and 16 other pilgrims were injured.

<HEAD>Government Agrees To Pay $170,000 To Settle Surveillance Lawsuit</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will pay $ 170,000 to settle a lawsuit by a woman who claims her late husband was illegally discredited by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Cointelpro domestic surveillance program. The settlement ends a dispute over information the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says would endanger national security if it were publicly disclosed in the course of the litigation. The department invoked the state-secret privilege to protect the information, but an appeals court ruled that the plaintiff could proceed with the lawsuit notwithstanding government concerns about national security. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appealed the ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> but as part of the settlement will withdraw its petition for high-court review of the case. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to pay <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertson </PERSON> $ 170,000 to settle her claim that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> forced her late husband's expulsion from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1964 by making it appear that he was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or police informant Mrs. <PERSON> Albertson </PERSON> had claimed that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> planted a fictious report in a car used by party members to make it appear that her husband was an informant. As part of the settlement, Mrs. <PERSON> Albertson </PERSON> agreed to drop her lawsuit along with a Freedom of Information Act claim for release of government documents, the department said. Both sides stipulated that the settlement was not `` an admission of liability or fault'' by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government or any employees, the department said. Mrs. <PERSON> Albertson </PERSON> also agreed to join the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in asking the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here to vacate last April's opinions on the state-secret question. This would mean the appellate court decision would not have any legal significance as a precedent. In a split decision, a three-judge panel rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request that it order dismissal of the lawsuit in the ground that state secrets would be revealed. The court rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s assertion that `` evidence of the government's activities of 20 to 30 years ago will result in the disclosure of state secrets today.'' In an unusual move, the court published a censored version of a dissent by Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>. Twelve of the 18 pages of <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s opinion were deleted because they contained classified information. <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said the government had a `` legitimate and compelling interest in preventing disclosure of exceedingly senstive national security information.'' He cited an affidavit by Assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geer </PERSON>, head of the bureau's intelligence division, that disclosure of evidence would `` pose a serious risk to the personal safety'' of government informants and `` cause serious damage'' to national security. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represented Mrs. <PERSON> Albertson </PERSON>, called the settlement a victory for her client.

 Fifteen House members _ including four Republicans _ who had earlier opposed a measure to finance abortions for poor women in the case of rape or incest sided Wednesday with the pro-choice faction by voting to override President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto. `` I've thought a lot about this,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, saying he concluded it was a woman's decision whether to have an abortion. `` I do n't think I've been elected to come down here and make those decisions for them.'' But he was among the few who had a true change of heart on the issue. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON>, D-Ky., who led debate for the Democrats, is chairman of the subcommittee that produced the massive spending bill for labor, health and education programs, which contains the expanded Medicaid coverage for abortions <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON> voted to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto but said he is not in favor of abortion. `` I have never voted for an amendment or a bill that legalized abortion,'' said <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON>, who voted ` no' Oct. 11 when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> took a pro-choice turn by approving 216-206 the amendment to include rape and incest as reasons a woman could get Medicaid to pay for her abortion. `` I like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He's wrong this time,'' he said before voting to override. An aide to Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa., said her boss has always been in favor of a woman's right to an abortion in the case of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother His problem with the amendment added Oct. 11 was with an unrelated section relating to hypodermic needles for drug addicts. The needle language was modified by the time the bill got to the president, so <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> had no reason to want the bill vetoed, said his press secretary, <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziemian </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, R-Tenn., voted to override the veto because he supported the many programs, other than abortion, that would be funded by the bill, said his spokesman `` He did not see today's vote on a abortion, but for education and -LRB- other -RRB- programs,'' said aide <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, R-Mich., who also opposed the Oct. 11 language known as the Boxer amendment, issued a statement after his vote Wednesday to override the president's veto, saying: `` I just do n't believe that anyone who is a victim of rape or incest should be denied this right If it is legal for someone who can afford it, how can we make it illegal for a victim of rape or incest who is poor?'' The other 10 members who opposed the Boxer amendment but voted to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto were Reps. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, D-Ga.; <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, D-Ky.; <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn.; and Meanwhile, three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who had supported the Boxer amendment sided with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto. Both Reps. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, R-Md., and <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., said they supported a woman's right to an abortion in the cases of rape, incest or to save her life, but are opposed to using federal funds for the They both said that the amendment proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., that they favored was on preference, not funding, and that their vote to sustain the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto was consistent with their opposition to the use of federal money for abortions Rep. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> McCandless </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., said his vote to sustain <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto had nothing to do with He said he opposes the level of funding for the three agencies in the appropriations package, and that he still believes, as demonstrated by his vote Oct. 11 in favor of the Boxer amendment, that a woman has a right to a federally funded abortion in cases of rape, incest or to save her life.

<TEXT>
 A South African missile built with technology provided by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> made its first flight this summer from a South African testing range, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Citing unidentified intelligence sources and a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> document, the network said <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> has been engaged in a partnership with <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to develop a nuclear missile capability for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> provides missile technology in return for a continuous supply of enriched uranium for its own nuclear warheads, and the use of a long-range test site. The network said the <LOCATION> Overberg </LOCATION> test range in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a missile assembly building at the site were built for the use of both countries, and that Israeli engineers have worked there for several years. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> document said the first test resulting from the joint project took place July 5 when a missile flew 900 miles southeast from the test site to the <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Edward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. The document identified the South African state arms maker <ORGANIZATION> Armscor </ORGANIZATION> as the builder of the missile, and said Israeli technology was provided through <ORGANIZATION> Urdan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, based outside <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 An Israel-backed militia expelled 28 Lebanese from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Wednesday after three of their relatives defected from the militia to a rival group, a spokesman said. The 28 family members, all from the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem village of <LOCATION> Ayta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chaab </LOCATION> _ about a half-mile from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border _ were ordered to leave the zone by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia. <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahad </PERSON>, the ex-Lebanese army general who commands the militia, issued the order after deciding the three militiamen, ages 18, 19, and 21, defected to the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militia Amal, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Lahad </LOCATION>'s headquarters here said. The Syrian-backed Amal, which opposes Israeli control in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, had claimed Monday it captured the three men while they were supposedly hunting game. Lahad's militia is mainly made up of Christians, although it includes some Shiites.

<HEAD>Partisan Clash In Senate Over Aid To Poland And Hungary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Republican and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators clashed Wednesday on the magnitude of aid to non-communist governments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with Democrats accusing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of committing `` billions for war but only small change for peace.'' Republicans counterattacked, charging Democrats with attempting to solve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s serious economic problems with a flood of taxpayers' money which they said would only serve to bail out `` failed socialist dinosaurs.'' `` We have to be very careful and pragmatic about what we propose to do,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` There should not be a contest about how much money we can drag out of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Treasury.'' `` Some have complained that there are those in this body who are doing this to embarrass the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; that is simply wrong,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, R-Del., who managed the Democratic version of the bill on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor `` What we are trying to do is to give shape to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. `` The only real issue is the level of commitment.'' Democrats said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may lose a historic opportunity to end the Cold War and encourage the spread of democratic institutions and free enterprise throughout Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and ultimately in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself. The debate comes after months of partisan squabbling about aid levels for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> which some say is on the verge of peaceful change from communism to democracy. Under pressure to do more, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has little by little expanded his aid proposal to its current level of $ 451 million over three years. The House last week voted for an $ 840 million package of grants and loans for the two countries. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had earlier urged adoption of a three-year $ 1.2 billion aid plan. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats now seek passage of a proposal sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., to authorize a total $ 989 million in grants and loans over three years The <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> bill includes $ 125 million in food aid, $ 200 million in currency stabilization loans, $ 200 million in trade credit insurance guarantees, $ 40 million in environmental aid, and $ 320 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 80 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to promote development of private enterprise. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> offered a substitute measure boosting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal by about $ 100 million to $ 585 million over the three-year period and tying assistance to the development of a capitalist economy. Several Democrats used the debate to renew a drumbeat of criticism against an administration they say is passively watching from the sidelines as history takes a momentous turn. `` When asked for dramatic new steps, the administration takes a wait and see attitude,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt. `` When asked for a solid commitment of aid, it instead offers a few words of encouragement `` Why is this administration so willing to commit billions for war but only small change for peace?'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> asked.

Four of them were taken to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>'s Intermountain Burn Center, where they were in serious condition with burns and lacerations, hospital officials said. The fifth man was taken to <LOCATION> LDS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with multiple fractures, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Otho </PERSON> `` O.J.'' Reed of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> died at <ORGANIZATION> Evanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after attempts to revive him failed, according to hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>. Two workers were admitted to <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, and four others were treated and released. The blast occurred as workers tried to install a gas compressor unit in a compressor building of <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Anschutz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> gas processing plant about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> said. Company officials were unsure what sparked the explosion, but it appears it was caused by a gas leak. The fire in the building was brought under control by <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> crews before local firefighters arrived, <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> said. The New Haven explosion and fire at the Acme Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was quickly put out with dry chemicals stored inside the plant, said Fire Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON>. He said the cause of the fire was under investigation. The injured man came running out of the plant with his pants still on fire and yelling, `` Help me,'' said a co-worker, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> VanWinkle </PERSON>. The employee rolled on the grass in a desperate attempt to put out the flames before VanWinkle, 29, was able to put out the fire with an extinguisher he grabbed inside the building, he said. The victim was in critical condition at <LOCATION> Yale-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with burns. <PERSON> VanWinkle </PERSON> said he and the victim were responsible for baking silicon-treated fiberglass.

 For the second time in five weeks, a sailor stationed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Midway has been convicted of espionage, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> identified the second sailor, who was sentenced to 10 years' confinement at hard labor, as electonics warfare technician, Petty Officer Third Class <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 21, was convicted `` for conspiring with Airman Recruit <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON> to commit espionage and for making false statements'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, was sentenced last month to 35 years for trying to pass classified material to a Soviet agent. The sailors were arrested by NIS on July 25 in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where the Midway is based. They were apprehended after an eight-month investigation, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` No other sailors have been implicated'' in the case, the spokesman said. Besides his 10-year sentence, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> received a dishonorable discharge, reduction in rank from paygrade E-3 to E-1, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said a general court martial was convened and charges against <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> referred to a trial by a military judge at the order of the commander of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Seventh Fleet, Vice Adm. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The sailor's two-day trial began Oct. 18 in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. The spokesman said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> pleaded not guilty and his case will be reviewed by the fleet commander before he begins serving his sentence. <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON>, who worked in food service aboard the aircraft carrier, also was convicted of possession and distribution of hashish, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said last month. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON> did not have a security clearance, but that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had one. The spokesman said he could not provide any details of the classified information involved in the case. Asked about a report that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> took classified documents from a receptacle used to hold such documents slated for burning in the electronics warfare center of the carrier, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said he could not comment. `` That is part of the investigation that is still going on,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON>'s court martial was in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, as well, and he was convicted on Sept. 24 on charges of attempted espionage, failure to report a contact with a Soviet citizen, conspiracy to unlawfully transfer classified material, and possession, use and distribution of hashish. <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON>, who also received a dishonorable discharge, had been in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for 2 1 @ 2 years and had served aboard the Midway since May 1988, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had been in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> the same period of time as <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON> and had been stationed aboard the aircraft carrier since May 1987, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said it has not yet been determined where the men will serve out their sentences, but that it would be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The spokesman said that <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON> had made a `` pre-trial agreement'' with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials and that `` a reduced sentence had been discussed,'' but that he could not comment on a report that the sailor's term was reduced to 15 years in exchange for testifying against <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> at his court-martial. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s mother said Wednesday that her son and <PERSON> Wilmoth </PERSON> did n't know each other before they enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, speaking through tears in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION>, said she knows her son is innocent. `` I know him. He would not do anything like that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. She said she and her husband, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> learned that their son was in trouble when he called Saturday night. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told his parents he was n't guilty. `` He would n't lie. ... They did n't believe him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

 The defendant in the rape and murder of a pregnant doctor angrily swore at a prosecutor and judge Wednesday in a courtroom outburst that ended with the accused killer handcuffed and taken away. `` I'm leaving, man! I'm leaving, -LRB- expletive -RRB-! You in trouble!'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> screamed as prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> cross-examined a defense psychiatrist who testified the suspect was too deranged to be prosecuted. Several jurors stared in surprise at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION>, who was standing at the defense table. The defendant then said softly: `` There's nothing I can do about it, man I'm telling you straight out.'' The turmoil was sparked when <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> asked Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> if <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> could be faking insanity to receive lenient treatment. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Leff </PERSON> then cleared the jury from the room and instructed <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> he would tolerate no further outbursts _ which prompted another explosion from the defendant. `` Well what the -LRB- expletive -RRB- is that, judge? ... You want me to stop it? I ca n't control it! Listen to me, man, I'm not normal, man, at all, at all,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` That's what got me into trouble here now. ... I'm here to get help, brother.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was then handcuffed and led from the courtroom. <PERSON> Leff </PERSON> brought the jury back, and cross-examination of <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> continued. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 23, is on trial for the rape and murder of Dr. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON>, 33, originally of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, in her fourth-floor office at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Jan. 9. She was five months pregnant. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, chief of forensic psychiatry at <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has been in and out of mental hospitals for the past decade, appears to have a psychosis related to schizophrenia. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Marvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornberg </PERSON> admitted in opening remarks that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> committed the crimes charged, but he argued that his client is insane and therefore not responsible for his actions.

 A decision will be made later this year on plans to move forward with a number of Star Wars experiments at <LOCATION> Kwajalein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atoll </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said on Wednesday. There are some 2,900 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s missile test facility on the island. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has concluded an environmental impact statement on whether programs connected with the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> program _ formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> _ would have a significant environmental affect on the atoll. The Army wants to provide `` test range facilities and support services'' on the island, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The proposed SDI tests at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kwajalein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION> include the sensing and tracking of re-entry vehicles launched by missiles from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. Such a segment of the space-based anti-missile system envisions rockets intercepting and destroying enemy missiles during the middle and latter stages of their flight. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> ordered an extensive environmental impact statement, after a preliminary report found that the acceleration of the Star Wars program would have no significant impact on any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility, with the exception of <LOCATION> Kwajalein </LOCATION>. At that time, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Potential impacts include the possible degradation of water quality around the islands; the possible degradation of the marine habitat ... and possible socio-economic impacts as a result of population increases.'' But after the latest study, <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> `` believes we can minimize any adverse affects on the environment'' if it goes through with its proposed actions on the atoll. The Army will not move forward with any action until a 30-day period passes, during which opponents of the action may file protests if they wish, Bridges said.

<TEXT>
 Tent cities that spread out in parks and vacant lots after the deadly Oct. 17 earthquake are unhealthy and dangerous, firefighters and health officials said Wednesday. `` Our plan is not to physically move people but to convince them that their options are better at other places,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> Callaghan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where about 160 people have set up camp. Some of those living in the tent cities were driven from their homes because of damage. But fright has kept many others outside even if inspectors have certified them sound. Still others refuse to move to <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters because they've gathered belongings into the tents _ things like sofas and televisions _ that are n't allowed into the shelters. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said there is concern that tent dwellers who are cooking on charcoal braziers could be taking them in the tents, creating fire and health hazards. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, one of the tent encampment's organizers, said he would try to persuade people to move but would let them decide for themselves. Many of the people living in the tent cities refuse to enter any building because they feel unsafe, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, a county employee. About 1,200 <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> residents were displaced by the quake and aftershocks. The quake killed dozens of people, injured thousands and caused more than $ 7.1 billion damage throughout <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, a poor agricultural community just a few miles from the epicenter, was especially hard it.

 Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> on Wednesday told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he would again ban television cameras from his scheduled appearance before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. His attorney hinted strongly that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> would again refuse to testify. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who has been subpoenaed to appear on Friday, invoked his right to ban television and radio coverage of the testimony during a meeting between his attorneys and the subcommittee staff. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joyce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> denied a request by the four major television networks for a permanent injunction that would keep the clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from enforcing the rule permitting a witness to ban broadcast coverage. The subcommittee on employment and housing of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is investigating alleged fraud, influence-peddling and mismanagement during <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s eight-year tenure. Last month he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify, contending the subcommittee members had prejudged him. In an interview Wednesday night, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, said a decision on whether <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> would testify Friday would not be made until Thursday morning. But he said he had seen little evidence that the subcommittee's attitude toward the former secretary had changed. `` I am still convinced that these people have prejudged my client without merit and we have certainly not foreclosed a continuation of the option we invoked at the previous hearing,'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>, counsel for the subcommittee, declined comment on the substance of the meeting except to confirm that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorneys had renewed their request that television and still cameras and radio coverage be prohibited `` It was a cordial and frank discussion,'' <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> said. Another congressional source, however, said that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorneys asked whether the subcommittee would require his presence in the event he would again refuse to testify and were told that subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., would insist that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> personally Another subcommittee member, however, said he thought it would be a waste of time to hold a hearing if <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, the only scheduled witness, was not going to testify. `` I'm not sure it's worth us wasting our time to hear him tell us'' he wo n't testify, said Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> could tell us very much anyway. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> appeared voluntarily before the panel in May and said he took no direct role in decisions about what projects to finance, asking only that projects supported by prominent Republicans receive `` careful consideration.'' That appearance was covered live. Since then, however, a former <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> deputy and documents released by the agency have indicated that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> played a greater role in some such decisions involving friends and political associates. In addition to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, three other former top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, including two who served as his top aides, have refused to testify on grounds that their testimony might tend to incriminate them. The judge dismissed the suit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The networks, in alleging a violation of the First Amendment, contended that the House may not arbitrarily delegate to a private party the right to determine whether TV coverage of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s appearances will be allowed <PERSON> Green </PERSON> ruled, however, that judicial review of the question is barred by the Constitution. She said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule is within the legitimate legislative sphere and is essential to legislating. The judge said the TV networks `` have chosen the wrong forum in which to present their objection. Their recourse lies not with the courts, but rather with the co-equal branch of government'' that enacted the rule.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Wednesday night boosting by $ 20 million the federal effort to lessen the hazards posed by earthquakes and to reduce the losses they cause. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., whose own state lies across an earthquake fault, was adopted on voice vote without debate It now goes to the House. It increases the authorization for earthquake hazard programs from the present $ 85 million to $ 105 million and expands the mission of agencies responsible for increasing earthquake preparedness. For example, the bill directs the preparation of model building codes to make structures more resistant to quakes and expands education and training programs. It also directs the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey to do further work on the exact location of fault lines and to establish a center for the international exchange of earthquake information. Of the additional $ 20 million authorization, $ 8 million would be used for a study to determine why some buildings withstood last week's earthquake in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> while others did not. The remaining $ 12 million would be used for earthquake preparedness. The actual $ 20 million is contained in the earthquake relief provisions of the stopgap appropriations bill sent to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier Wednesday. Under the rules of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, every appropriation must be accompanied by an authorization bill that sets a spending ceiling.

<TEXT>
 Members of the <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> tribe Wednesday rejected a $ 35.6 million pact with the state to curtail the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' off-reservation hunting and fishing. Outside the tribal hall, a crowd of people protesting the agreement erupted in chants and screams of jubilation when told at 9:25 p.m. of the outcome: 439 votes against the plan and 366 for it. The pact, which many had expected to pass, would have paid the tribe for not fishing for 10 years, then been renegotiated. Some ceremonial fishing would still have been allowed. `` I feel great,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a Lac du Flambeau member. `` They saved our rights.'' Before the vote, about 30 to 40 opponents carried signs criticizing the agreement as a `` sellout'' of the tribe's 19th century treaty rights and some heckled tribal government officials who walked by. The treaty rights, which courts have ruled allow Indians to spearfish off their reservations, have caused controversy and sparked some violence. Some sports fishermen are angered that the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> can fish with spears and out of season, which other fishermen can not do. `` Our ancestors thought enough to preserve our rights through this treaty and our council is selling it,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoms </PERSON>, a tribal member who lives on the reservation in northwestern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Tribal Chairman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> ordered the tribal center secured by officers, saying the action was `` due to numerous threats to disrupt the referendum election or take over the building.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said he received a death threat after he left a meeting on the reservation Tuesday night. `` They threatened me last night after the meeting and we've had numerous threats and calls,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. He said the death threat was made in person, although he declined to identify the individual. About 10 officers from tribal police, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Vilas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> patrolled near the center. Ms. <PERSON> Thoms </PERSON> said the protesters were prepared to go to jail if tribal officials tried to quash their last-ditch efforts. `` I've got my medicine and my toothbrush in my purse,'' she said The state's six <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> bands retain spearfishing, hunting, food gathering and timber cutting rights under court-affirmed 19th century treaties that ceded northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to the federal government. The <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION>, with about 2,500 members, is traditionally the most active of the state's <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> bands during the spearfishing season. In recent years, opponents of the treaty rights have staged large and sometimes violent protests at lakes where the Indians have spearfished. Last spring nearly 200 protesters were arrested. The settlement with the <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION> would have established a $ 35.6 million trust fund from which individual tribal members would have been paid. If it had been approved, it would have advanced to the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Legislature, where it faced opposition. Before the vote, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the plan would advance no further if it were defeated and the band is unlikely to continue negotiations with the state. Opponents had thought there was little hope the agreement would be voted down. They said a plan to give each tribal member $ 1,800 in the first year of the agreement would probably ensure its passage. `` The Great Spirit won over tonight,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Maulson </PERSON>, an organizer of the off-reservation spearfishing. `` The <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION> people came through.''

 After a week of closed-door bargaining with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> stepped before television cameras to announce a compromise adding $ 1.1 billion to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug program. His Republican counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, quickly cautioned that they still needed to make sure <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders would accept the deal. `` I do n't have to,'' the courteous, white-haired <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> informed <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> quietly _ but not so quietly that reporters could n't hear. `` He kinda left it up to me.'' A year after he relinquished his powerful post as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader, much of what happens in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still is up to the 71-year-old sixth term Democrat from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. _ When <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> believed lobbyists were getting out of hand, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved his bill restricting their activities It may well be the only ethics legislation enacted this year. _ When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a drug initiative <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> considered inadequate, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> used his post as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations chairman to force negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on expanding the program and give Democrats a legislative success on a high-profile bill _ As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s senior Democrat, he also claimed the title of president pro tempore, third in line to the presidency It's been mostly a ceremonial post until now, but <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> is overseeing a near doubling of its budget for staff and other support and strengthening his influence in the process. _ He has been unabashedly funneling federal dollars into his poverty-stricken home state The 1990 military construction bill orders the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to accelerate spending on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> projects to $ 49 million this year _ more than 10 times what the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposed. Until <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> stepped down after six years as majority leader, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s top official had never before given up the job and remained in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s decision reflected in part a dissatisfaction with his old-school, formal and sometimes quirky approach to the job. Procedure often seemed more important than policy. In the wake of another presidential loss, the Democrats also wanted someone who could better counter the White House on television. There was much speculation that <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> would simply take care of home-state concerns and attend to his cherished study of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> history. But that is not his way. `` Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> says, precisely quoting Ecclesiastes 9:10, the King James Version. `` I have that sense of duty. I follow it meticulously.'' `` I think he's been freed'' by giving up the role of party leader, says <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Peek </PERSON>, his former spokeswoman. `` Anybody who knew him, knew that he was n't going out to pasture,'' she said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> was known for seemingly endless meetings as majority leader, hoping to enlist as many Democrats as possible on any given issue. He says he still tries to be fair, but, `` I do n't have to concern myself with developing a consensus.'' Beyond his titles, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s influence permeates the institution he's called home since 1959. Many of the people he appointed when majority leader stayed behind to oversee a broad swath of the machinery that operates the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In real estate alone, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> probably reigns over more of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wing of the Capitol than anyone else, with his two suites of offices and support staff rooms. When Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, goes to work in the morning, it's in the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Byrd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rooms </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> say there's no friction between them, although others point to some instances. For example, on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> looked up from some work and asked <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> if he needed a vote on one of his bills, a motion the leader would make. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> politely told him he already did it. Republicans note that <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s drug plan was developed almost entirely within the appropriations committee, implying it was foisted upon <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. The two Democrats deny that too. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> brushes aside suggestions that personal clout is what gave his drug plan priority over those of others who sought to take on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the politically popular topic. He just knows how to work the system and line up support, he said. `` One could not be expected to walk into the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as a freshman and do that kind of work,'' he said. `` There has to be some knowledge of how this machine operates, and some experience in dealing with other senators. `` And I've had ample experience,'' he says. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., says what <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> has done so far is `` just the tip of the iceberg. `` I think now he has the time and the position to focus his attention on creating legislation,'' he said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> is a powerful presence for his party, <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said, who `` by force of personality is very intimidating to members on the other side of the aisle.'' Away from the spotlight, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> has been using his position as appropriations chairman to take care of the folks back home, as his work on the military spending bill shows. He's also made clear that he will represent <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> interests without any help from intermediaries. His anti-lobbying bill was a reaction against the hiring of consultants by <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to seek a government grant. But he's never far from the center of action. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Republican <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, reacting to a federally supported exhibit including homosexual photographs, was tying the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into knots in his effort to prohibit spending by the federal arts agencies on anything that might be considered offensive. But when <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> tried to get the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to pass an amendment instructing <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s committee against compromising with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> put his foot down. `` I am not going to follow the instructions of this amendment or any other amendment or resolution that might be introduced on this subject,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> declared. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then tabled, or killed, the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment. A <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise emerged, much watered down from what <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> wanted, which would establish a panel to oversee federal arts endowment policy. A third of that panel will be appointed by the president, a third by the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and a third by the president pro tempore of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>.

<HEAD>The Good and Bad of Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Junk bonds often get a bad rap from people who forget that on occasion such financing tools have helped new companies get started, weak companies grow strong, and small companies grow big. But, as happens eventually to everything in the world of creative finance, the notion has been abused. Rather than financing sound enterprises, junk bonds often became vehicles for the pursuit of greed, power and fanciful schemes. They have made certain individuals enormously and quickly wealthy. They have put once-sound companies on the edge of financial disaster. They have thwarted the growth of many companies, and they've all but destroyed others. They have also shattered the dreams of many of those who bought them in expectation of big profits, because now they must sit and wait and wonder if the companies in which they invested will ever be able to repay them. Default rates are rising, and conceivably could mount into still another national financial disaster should a deep recession occur. There are about $ 200 billion of them out there, and they are widely held. If a recession should occur it could ruin some overleveraged companies and destroy values in pension funds, stocks, mutual funds and college endowments. Short of a recession, there still could be serious problems for holders. The junk bond market is n't as liquid as other markets; there is no assurance that buyers are out there at any given time. Given that, prices could fall. Several large issuers of junk bonds already are in default, among them <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, while others are in deep trouble: <ORGANIZATION> Griffen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Seaman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION>, Resorts International and Integrated Resources. Defaults and moratoriums total $ 4 billion this year. The nation's largest retailing empire, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has come apart only a year after it was put together with junk financing. Other issuers survive by selling off parts. The picture need n't be painted entirely in somber tones of gray, however, because some companies are bound to thrive, continue to pay the high interest on their bonds and still have enough left in the kitty to finance growth. Growth is the secret by which issuers of junk bonds hope to cast off the burden of debt, but that growth has to be vigorous. Within months, some issuers have discovered that the growth they envisioned just was n't there. When that happens, the company must think of cannibalizing itself, or selling off parts to meet financial obligations. But the consequence of that is often to further erode growth, thus threatening a downward spiral. <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> computer maker that went from sales of about $ 8.5 million in 1978 to about $ 1 billion 10 years later, was acquired in a leveraged buyout earlier this year for $ 1.3 billion cash and junk bonds. With its growth record, its products, its reputation and its ability to keep abreast of developments in its field, Prime appeared to be a safe risk, a company capable of generating enough cash to keep bondholders happy. This week the new owners of Prime, J.H. <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, sought to slash costs by dismissing 2,500 workers, or 20 percent of Prime's payroll, setting off speculation in the industry about the company's future If Prime can not support good workers, how will it support good products? Can it service its customers? Gain new ones? Can it create new products to match the innovative equipment from its vigorous competitors? Conceivably, Prime could get its big bills paid down in four or five years, and then turn its energies to growth and greater profitability. But until then, it will be carrying an interest-rate burden that's like a dead-weight anchor.

<HEAD>Amish Acceptance of Visitors Center Is Reluctant, But Growing</HEAD>

 Tourists to Amish country often return home with simple notions of the Amish as merely quaintly dressed people who drive buggies. Their secluded ways have opened the Amish for decades to such misconceptions and unchallenged commercial exploitation. As an antidote, a visitors center opened last year to offer tourists a self-guided lesson of Amish and Mennonite church history and culture. Perhaps surprisingly, the center has become a learning place for Amish children and even adults. The founders had hoped this would happen, but feared the secluded Amish would shun the modern facility. The more worldly Mennonites have been strong supporters of the project since the beginning. About half the Amish children in this region go to public schools, with the other half attending much smaller Amish schools where one instructor teaches first through eighth grade. Neither the public nor the Amish schools offer reliably thorough training in Amish history, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoder </PERSON>, a former Amishman who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and now teaches at <ORGANIZATION> Goshen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The result, he said, is that most Amish children have only spotty knowledge of their cultural history of persecution in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the flight to religious freedom in the New World. `` They know a few facts, but not so much,'' <PERSON> Yoder </PERSON> said. So in small but growing numbers, Amish are visiting the center to learn about their past. `` They say that this is a good program, and they have a real appreciation for the accuracies of it,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beachy </PERSON>, a guide at the center. In the 17th century, <PERSON> Mennonite </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakob </PERSON> <PERSON> Amman </PERSON> split from the established church with his followers, the Amish, over doctrinal matters. Both groups resisted the enforced teachings of the German state-controlled church and state militarism, and members found themselves persecuted for their beliefs. They began emigrating to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, settling largely in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. While the Mennonites have become known for their international missions and disaster relief, the Old Order Amish have maintained their separateness from modern society. They continue to wear plain clothing and speak a dialect of German; they shun modern conveniences such as electrical appliances, engined-powered farm machinery and automobiles. These Amish ways caused their leadership to waver in its support for the visitors center. `` Initially, before the design was finalized, there was a fair amount of support from Amish leadership,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichti </PERSON>, a former Mennonite preacher who directs the center. `` Once they discovered it was going to cost $ 1 million and have enough bathrooms for 10 -LRB- people -RRB-, they began to wonder if our commitment to be non-commercial could be held. `` The official stance was a wait-and-see attitude. Since they have toured the facility, they have become much more supportive.'' Still there is ambivalence, and some resistance. The center uses audio tape and visual aids, modern devices disapproved by the Amish, to tell its story. `` But they realize that's about the only way you get the story across,'' <PERSON> Yoder </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, the reliance on tapes and slides puts Amish leaders in an awkward position, <PERSON> Beachy </PERSON> said. While they may approve of the center's mission, openingly supporting it could be interpreted as an implicit endorsement of the modern devices, he said. `` Individually, they feel good about it, but then to go out and promote it _ they go pretty low-key on that,'' he said. Only one or two groups of children from the area's all-Amish schools have been among the 67,000 visitors who have toured the center since it opened last year. Most of the Amish student visitors have come from public school groups. <PERSON> Lichti </PERSON> nevertheless expects a growing number of Amish in the coming months. In response to the growing Amish acceptance of the center, the board of directors is prepared to make a crucial modification in the asphalt parking lot, <PERSON> Yoder </PERSON> said. `` We're now talking about putting in hitching racks, so that when they come in their buggies, they can tie the horses.''

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats have launched an autumn political offensive, accusing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of timidity _ which is a slightly kinder way of saying wimp. It's a label <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confronted and overcame when he was a candidate. Now there is a toughening tone at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican allies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, against the risk that Democrats can revive the image as an issue by calling him a hesitant, timid leader. Among other things, the president is vowing to stand, lobby and fight for a capital gains tax reduction, something the leader of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats says he will not get. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the tax measure as part of a budget bill, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> stripped it away and differences between te two bills now are under negotiation. The White House said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will look for the first opportunity to push the issue to a vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where the administration claims it can get majority support in an up or down test. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to contact as many as 20 senators in a personal lobbying drive for the tax cut he advocated as a candidate. `` He's going to press for it and it's not the greatest issue of our times, but it sure as hell is a campaign promise that he kept and I think that's what people admire about him,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the Republican whip. Another challenge to the Democrats: Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may pick an issue and try to veto one item in a composite bill, thus claiming a power of line-item veto both he and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have sought. `` We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test case,'' said White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. With that power, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could, for example, have vetoed only the abortion language in the appropriations bill he rejected last Saturday because it provided federal funds for Medicaid abortions in cases of rape or incest. The idea of forcing a legal challenge and a court decision on whether a president already has the power to veto specific items is not new business. It was discussed during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, but never pushed to a test. And nobody said it was going to happen this time. But raising the prospect fits the strategy of counterattack, drawing a line against the Democrats running <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where the power to build hostage items into hard-to-veto bills always has been guarded against administration inroads. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, sounded the Democratic offensive: `` The key to the current <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> strategy has been to perpetuate a precarious status quo. Any great changes, even those that might inure to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s benefit, are avoided at all costs. Change is to be put off. The status quo is to be preserved. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears to be determined to go down in history as the hesitation president,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> a week ago. `` At least his first year in office could be entitled ` The Year of Living Timidly.''' Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority, already had accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` timidity'' in dealing with the opportunities opened by the move toward democracy in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The House has voted to approve nearly twice as much aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as the administration proposed. Democratic leaders and more than a few Republicans complained at administration inaction in the brief and futile Panamanian coup against <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> forced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into an abortion veto that could hurt Republicans; the Democrats outmaneuvered him on flag-burning by passing a law he did n't want and rejecting a constitutional amendment he sought. `` For the last three weeks, as it becomes more and more obvious that the Democratic leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ca n't get their job done, they have been attacking President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> more and more aggressively,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the House Republican whip. For all of that, the Democrats have had trouble finding the voices and the themes to compete with the White House. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> acknowledged the problem, saying that congressional Democrats must present a cohesive program, not a batch of unconnected issues. He said they're still trying, and hope to put together a consensus <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> agenda to be presented next year. First, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president will have to settle the capital gains fight along with other major issues _ their rival child care programs; a minimum wage bill to replace one <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed as too high and might veto again because of his insistence on a lower training wage for new workers; differences on how and how much to spend fighting drugs; the stalled budget bill that has forced automatic, if probably temporary, spending cuts. There's plenty there to test who's timid and who is n't.

 And who but <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON> could get away with explaining yeast dough in terms of burps: `` The main ingredients of flour are starch and gluten. It's the starch in the dough that feeds upon the yeast, belching forth gas that pushes up the gluten.'' Child nurtures you through bread-baking, explaining how yeast works, what flour to buy, what kneading is all about. Photographs make it clear just how the dough should look along the way. And how can anyone resist trying a souffle when she writes: `` The souffle is undoubtedly the egg at its most magnificent, the egg in all its puffing power. How impressive is the chocolate or cheese souffle, its head rising dramatically out of its dish, and swaying ever so slightly as it is borne to the table.'' In a bow to health, she includes `` cream'' soups made with pureed rice. But she also suggests adding heavy or sour cream `` if you like.'' She also offers a fat-free `` heaven-sent'' poached chicken and recommends a cast-iron grill to cook meat without fat. But she writes: `` I, for one, would rather swoon over a few thin slices of prime beefsteak, or one small serving of chocolate mousee, or a sliver of foie gras than indulge to the full on such nonentities as fat-free gelatin puddings.'' Child grew up in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in a home with a hired cook, and did not take a cooking lesson until she was in her 30s. She graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1934 and after writing advertising copy for a short time, joined the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. She was sent off as a clerk to <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- now <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> -RRB-, where she met <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON>, a career diplomat 10 years her senior, in 1943. They married in 1946 and remain very close; she often talks in terms of `` we.'' He recently moved to a nursing home near their <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, home. They have no children. `` They just never came,'' she said matter-of-factly. `` I would be very happy to be a grandmother at this point.'' But in addition to her book, Child is busy these days working to improve the status of food professionals through the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION>, which she co-founded, and the <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Two years after their marriage, the <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> were sent to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where she enrolled at the Cordon Bleu cooking school. She was considered a bit odd by her friends, who all had hired help in the kitchen. `` I'd been looking for my life's work all along. And when I got into cooking I found it. I was inspired by the tremendous seriousness with which they took it.'' In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> she also met <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Louisette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bertholle </ORGANIZATION>, who needed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> collaborator for the first volume of `` Mastering the Art of French Cooking.'' Nine years in the making, it was published in 1961 with a foreword that began: `` This is a book for the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children's meals, the parent-chauffeur-den mother syndrome, or anything else which might interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to eat.'' And it ends: `` Above all, have a good time.'' Two years later, when Child was 51, <ORGANIZATION> WGBH </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> launched `` The French Chef'' series, and for 206 meals, she entertained and cajoled and encouraged viewers to do as she did. `` I happened to be the right woman at the right time,'' she said with modesty, noting that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had a French chef at the White House and more Americans were traveling abroad. `` Suddenly people began considering food with a capital ` F'.'' Besides, she was fun to watch, perhaps partly because of the on-air disasters, the first of which occurred with an apple charlotte. `` As I was looking, it did a slow collapse. You could hear the tears in my voice.'' To cover, she told viewers: `` You do n't want it too stiff.'' But the mistakes taught viewers how to make repairs, and made her more familiar. And since it's the good company that counts, her advice to others who make mistakes: `` Do n't apologize ever. It's very bad to apologize because people will say, ` That was n't very good, was it?'''

<HEAD>Abortion: America's No-Win Political Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most divisive social issue, one that stirs the soberest reflections of private conscience, the shrillest voices of public debate. So polarizing are the arguments over abortion, whether personal or political, they can separate the warmest of lovers, young adults from parents and grandparents, priests from their parishioners, officeholders from their jobs. Some women, even some men, are separated from their sanity. Suicide or years of melancholy are not unheard of, either as the consequence of a lamented abortion or of a struggling mother's anguish over her inability to provide for a child, perhaps woefully deformed or handicapped, that she has brought into the world The ethical complexities wear thick for some Americans, thin for others. Some find their answers in faith, some in science, and some in lonely desperation. At the heart of the furor is the question of whether human life begins with a baby's first breath, or nine months earlier with the microscopic conjunction of sperm and egg, or somewhere in between with the emergence of a `` viable'' fetus. At the fringe of that theological and scientific riddle are the ironies of fervor _ `` pro-life'' fanatics, for example, who risk murder by bombing abortion clinics; or militant mothers, children proudly in tow, marching for abortion rights. Each side claims the truth as its ally, and thus they agree on precious few facts. But there is little argument about this: Millions of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women, about one-fifth of those older than 15, have had, and will have, abortions. According to the <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttmacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Institute </PERSON>, a birth-control research group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 1.6 million abortions are performed annually. Nearly one-third of all pregnancies end in abortion. The issue separates the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the mainstream of public opinion, from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and even from his personal physician, <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who believes each woman is entitled to decide for herself whether to bear a child. It also separates President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of a decade ago, before he got religion from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In 1980, he opposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s idea of a constitutional amendment to overturn the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. Now, against all political odds, he supports such an amendment. Other conservatives are n't waiting for a constitutional revision _ which, to be realistic, is nowhere on the political horizon. Instead, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has itself begun chipping away at the `` Roe'' decision, the 1973 effort by Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> to balance the government's interest in protecting life and a woman's right to determine when _ and whether _ to have a child At least six states have new anti-abortion laws ready to take hold, pending a go-ahead from the court. As a quiet battle rages within the justices' chambers, the skirmishes outside the door are deafening. Advocates on either side have marched by the tens of thousands upon the court, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, state legislatures and even city halls. They wave blue-and-white placards, with black-and-white aphorisms, frequently more insult than idea. It is a single-issue crusade: Neither side much concedes voters should judge anyone, president or sheriff or dogcatcher, by any other standard. To one side, you are either `` pro-life' or you condone or commit murder. To the other, you are either `` pro-choice'' or you are willing to trample a woman's rights and threaten her health or even life. The <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> decision entitled all women to have abortions for any reason within the first three months of pregnancy. In upholding a restrictive <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law last summer, one declaring that life begins at conception, the latest court re-opened the door for a cornucopia of state efforts to legislate the issue. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would allow only those women whose lives are threatened by pregnancy, or those who are the victims of rape or incest, to have abortions. But he will not sign federal legislation to enable the poorest of sexually assaulted women to abort their fetuses at government expense. In his view, tax dollars should not be used to `` compound a violent act with the taking of an unborn life.'' Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, bitterly summarized the president's position this way: `` He would give his daughter _ or yours or mine _ every option. ... But if they can not afford a doctor, they must carry the unborn of that hateful act to term _ they have no choice.'' Sadly, even the most destitute women do have an abortion choice _ of sorts. It is essentially the same desperate option exercised by many young, unmarried women back in the days when most states banned abortions _ and when unwed mothers faced ostracism and could be forced to turn their babies over for adoption. For them, an abortion meant squalid procedures, sometimes self-administered, with knitting needles, bleach and coat-hangers. For some, it meant death. `` Women will have abortions, legal or not,'' says <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` The question is whether they will be legal, medically safe and available to every woman who needs one.'' The vast majority of abortions are performed within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, at walk-in clinics charging an average of only $ 225 or so. Despite the modest cost, many women appear to be resorting even now to amateur methods. Health officials in big cities are finding that some are intentionally using crack cocaine to induce uterine contractions. Others are trying megadoses of vitamin C, exotic herbs, and a menstrual extraction method using a <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> jar, aquarium tubing and other paraphernalia. Today's do-it-yourself techniques can be as hazardous as the old coat-hanger abortions, physicians say. Moreover, they sometimes damage the fetus rather than kill it. Drug-induced contractions can separate the placenta from the uterine wall, causing oxygen deprivation and a brain-damaged, rather than aborted, fetus. Cocaine can trigger a heart attack in the mother, or cause the baby to be born a drug addict. A woman who has plenty of money need n't worry about either her safety or legal risk, no matter what course local jurisdictions take. Some states, like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, seem certain to keep abortion legal for the indefinite future. And there are always clinics to be found overseas; in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, for example, a simple pill, known as the RU-486, can be used to end pregnancy within five weeks of conception. But the travel alternative, while easy enough for the career woman or affluent housewife with a pocketbook full of credit cards, is out of the question for ghetto teen-agers, or welfare mothers already struggling to support a roomful of kids. Thus the abortion debate, while usually couched in medical or theological terms, has a number of troubling class and racial overtones. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, women below the poverty level are more than three times as likely to have abortions as women whose incomes exceed $ 25,000. An astonishing number, about 500,000 a year, are teen-agers. And because many lack access to medical care early in pregnancy, they are more prone to seek abortions in later stages _ when more legal restrictions are now possible.

 Car and truck sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continued a slump, falling 20.5 percent in mid-October compared with the same time last year. The eight major automakers with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants reported Tuesday a 19 percent decline in car sales and a 22.8 percent drop in light truck sales in the Oct. 11-20 period. The reports were seen as further evidence that strong sales in August and September came partly from fear of 1990-model price increases and from incentives designed to clear dealer lots for the new vehicles.

<HEAD>Report: Securities Commission To Fine Drexel Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has decided to issue its largest-ever fine for fraud against the defunct Spanish unit of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper reported. <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s El Mundo daily said Tuesday the commission's directors recently approved a 70-million-peseta, or $ 615,000, fine against <ORGANIZATION> DBL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> for `` very serious'' civil infractions of trading rules. The paper said the commission must receive government approval before issuing the fine, which at five times the illicit profits earned represents the maximum penalty permitted under law. A spokesman for New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said: `` There's been no official decision. It's still under consideration and obviously we ca n't comment.'' But sources said they believed the fine would be lower and that a final decision was still some time away. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which recently pleaded guilty to unrelated fraud charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has pledged to toughen securities law compliance, closed the 27-employee Spanish unit in July, acknowledging `` improper behavior.'' A Spanish commission probe confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> unit fraudulently made 400 applications for shares worth $ 59 million in the April 20-May 6 partial privatization of the state-controled <ORGANIZATION> Repsol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> oil firm, the paper said. The probe showed the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> unit used the names of private citizens without their authorization to circumvent restrictions designed to assure the widest distribution of shares, then sold the acquired shares to 17 foreign institutional investors for a profit of $ 123,000. The commission began its investigation in June after a private individual said his bank had authorized the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Repsol </ORGANIZATION> shares without his knowledge. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundo </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> parent company would be legally responsible for paying the fine since the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> unit has been liquidated. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in September pleaded guilty to six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> felonies and began paying $ 650 million in penalties to settle a range of criminal securities fraud charges.

He backed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's opposition to pending legislation that would set time limits for rulemaking on some transportation-safety issues. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, charged with ensuring that vehicles meet minimum safety standards, drew bipartisan accusations of laxity during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` It seemed to us in the past that oftentimes <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> has been most subservient to ... ideological positions which seemed to say ` why should safety stand in the way of profit,''' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said Committee chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Nev </LOCATION>., described the agency in recent years as `` lethargic ... and some would say derelict.

Senators cited the delay as the most flagrant example of what they called the agency's foot-dragging The agency began studying a side-impact standard in 1979 but suspended action in 1982, only to renew its work last year, <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said. An estimated 10,000 Americans are klled in side-impact crashes each year, he said. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> also promised action by the end of 1990 on proposals to toughen standards for multipurpose vehicles such as small trucks and minivans, for child booster seats, for improving pedestrian safety, and for reducing head injuries caused by bumping into interior components. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1984.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of not sufficiently warning farmers about the dangers of fertilizers and pesticides to groundwater. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` calculates that 46 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counties contain groundwater susceptible to contamination from pesticides and fertilizers,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee on conservation and forestry He said Tuesday that wells are not systematically tested, research is not keeping up with the problem and national data on fertilizer and chemical damage to groundwater in each of the states is not available. `` It should come as no surprise then, that farmers have poor information on the consequences of the practices they employ _ beyond this year's yield,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which our farmers rely on for so much of their information, has not taken adequate steps to educate them about the possible consequences of polluting our water supplies with pesticides and fertilizers,'' he said. Furthermore, he said, the extension service is not providing much guidance to farmers about alternatives to chemical use. During a hearing on water quality, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said he had recently been informed that extension service agents were getting paid by chemical companies to be consultants. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vroom </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not heard of that happening, but said that the chemical manufacturers have long relied on information from extension agents and land grant universities. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nipp </PERSON>, director of the water quality initiative at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> and Land Grant Colleges, said it's widely known that fertilizer and pesticide dealers have a great deal of influence with how farmers use chemicals. `` Yet there is no national program to certify, train or provide educational materials to the dealers,'' <PERSON> Nipp </PERSON> said in testimony to the <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s subcommittee. He said the extension services would like to do more, but do n't have the money or personnel <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Nipp </PERSON> why extension agents were criticizing the system known as low intensity sustainable agriculture, which relies on organic procedures for increasing yields and controlling pests. `` Like all institutions, there is a certain amount of inertia,'' said <PERSON> Nipp </PERSON>. But he said there have been some `` fairly religious conversions'' by extension agents to organic methods. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said he called the hearing to help determine what kind of regulations pertaining to groundwater should be in the 1990 farm bill. `` We simply can not continue to encourage farmers to maximize program benefits at the expense of the environment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee has approved legislation requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to adopt new rules designed to stem multibillion-dollar telephone sales fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on a voice vote Tuesday, approved a bill by Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that would order the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to establish a minimum set of standards on so-called telemarketing within 180 days. The rules must give buyers the right to change their minds within a certain time after placing a phone order and require refunds if the goods are n't delivered by a specified date. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> also must establish restrictions on the time of day when phone solicitations may be made. In addition, the bill allows private citizens and state officials to sue in federal court anyone who violates the new FTC rules or commits telemarketing fraud; prohibits `` harassment'' of customers by telemarketing firms and directs the commission to set up an office to answer consumer questions. A nearly identical measure passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year on a voice vote but died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Telephone fraud has grown widely in recent years as hustlers offer phony prizes or try to sell goods such as gemstones and rare coins or shoddy merchandise. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had estimated there is $ 1 billion a year in telemarketing fraud. Private estimates have put the figure much higher, <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> added. `` The telephone is becoming an instrument to reach out and rob someone,'' <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said. The bill was designed to make telemarketing rules conform with 15-year-old <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> restrictions on door-to-door and mail-order sales, said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>. The commission earlier this month began formal proceedings to extend the mail-order regulations to telephone sales. The bill had the support of the banking industry this year, which has asserted it is losing several hundred million dollars a year when dissatisfied customers stop payment on Visa or <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> purchases made by phone, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> added. Before it approved the bill, the committee gave voice-vote approval to an amendment offered by Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, that specifies that the new FTC rules will not apply to securities, which are covered by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> two months ago adopted a `` penny stock'' rule requiring that the buyer must give the seller written confirmation before the sale is consummated. `` That's tougher than anything in our bill,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. In other action Tuesday, the committee, on a voice vote, authorized $ 109.8 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990 fiscal year, the year that began Oct. 1, and $ 121.5 million next year, up from $ 99.6 million in the 1989 fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> authorization was amended by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, to allow the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to consider what impact its rulings may have on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the provision was a response to the decision last month of the European Common Market to urge its 12 member nations to broadcast television programs made in the market at least 51 percent of the time, `` where practicable.'' He said amendment was a `` strong signal'' that until foreign telecommunications markets are completely open to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be watching its own interests carefully. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month authorized $ 109.8 million for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1990, but only $ 119.8 million for 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee also authorized $ 29.3 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for 1990 and 1991.

<HEAD>Americans in Moscow Will Be Able to Sleep at a Sheraton</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sheraton <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a $ 75 million luxury hotel, is slated to open by 1992, a few minutes away from from Red Square, Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced. The hotel will be built in a `` privileged zone'' in the city center, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said Tuesday at the signing of a joint venture contract by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city government. The city will provide a piece of choice real estate, <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> will supervise the construction and management of the hotel, and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> hope to stimulate business. `` We look forward to flying many planeloads of customers to the beautiful <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Sheraton,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the airlines. In return, the city of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will get a badly needed luxury hotel, plus access to Western hard currency. Sheraton, a division of <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, gets its foot in the door of a potentially large Soviet market; the deal also gives Sheraton rights to renovate the <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, an older, smaller hotel on <LOCATION> Petrovsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. And the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is happy to have <LOCATION> Sheraton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as a very visible American commercial enterprise on Gorky Street, one of the main commercial thoroughfares in the Soviet capital. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has said he wants perestroika to succeed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government official at the ceremony. `` This is an example of what is needed to make perestroika succeed,'' he said, using the Russian word for Soviet reforms. With 450 rooms at $ 200 a night or more, the hotel is meant largely for American and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> business travellers who until now have had to choose between the worn but well-located hotels run by the Soviet Intourist travel agency and the U.S.-built <PERSON> Mezhdunarodnaya </PERSON>, several miles from the city center. The service and ambiance of the Intourist hotels are the subject of frequent complaints from Western travellers. The Sheraton <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will employ about 650 people, most of them Soviets who will be trained in hotel services by Westerners drawn from <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION>'s network of Western European hotels, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapioltas </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> ITT-Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The hotel, to include an English pub and Italian, Japanese and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> restaurants, and a discoteque, will accept Western currencies rather than the Soviet ruble, which on the black market is worth about six times less than the conversion rate offered by state-owned banks. The arrangement allows Sheraton to finesse an aspect of Soviet law that has hampered previous such joint ventures, that Western firms may repatriate only Western currency, and may not convert rubles into hard currencies for transfer outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Sheraton and the city of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> each hold a 40 percent stake in the joint venture, and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> hold 10 percent apiece, officials said. Neogotiations are still under way to determine the exact amount that each partner will invest in the construction, said <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>. The Soviets are expected to supply workmen and raw materials, but Sheraton will supervise construction and have the right to import skilled craftsmen as needed, he said. The hotel will be located on Gorky Street in a block currently occupied largely by residential units, Soviet officials said. Contractors will preserve the facade of the existing buildings, and `` the street will be preserved to take into account the architectural character'' of the district, one of most historic in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saikin </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Government Officials Cool to Airline Takeover Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, who headed a group that acquired the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says the fear that debt-financed airline takeovers sacrifice safety is `` misleading.'' Testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor said `` a well-maintained fleet is in fact a far more cost-effective fleet to operate.'' His testimony came before a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that is looking into the tax policy aspects of mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts in the airline industry. Earlier in the day, senior <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> department officials told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that proposed legislation to restrict airline takeovers would n't be good for the industry or the country. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> added that every deal is different and one across-the-board rule would be `` naive and short-sighted.'' He said that `` the kind of person who would _ if he could _ cut back on maintenance procedures to save money would do this irrespective of what his company's capital structure might be.'' Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the oversight subcomittee, said the panel was looking into whether `` tax provisions have made the airlines more desirable and more susceptible to takeover activity.'' To combat that, another subcommittee member, Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, introduced legislation that would prohibit airlines purchased in leveraged buyouts from deducting interest payments from their taxes. Last week, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee voted to give the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> the authority to block a major airline takeover if it would jeopardize safety, hinder the company's ability to compete or put it in the hands of a foreign carrier. But a top <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the agency `` neither needs nor wants such authority.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of transportation for policy and international affairs, said the department `` would object strongly to any legislation that might inappropriately interfere with the free flow of capital in the airline industry or with allowing the dynamics of the marketplace to determine the capital structure of airlines.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said his boss, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that senior advisers `` will recommend to the president that he veto any such legislation.'' Another government official, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opposes `` any legislative attempt to single out and address concerns regarding leveraged buyouts in a specific industry.'' `` The tax code is generally too blunt an instrument to draw distinctions between good and bad debt or between good and bad LBOs,'' said <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, a senior economic adviser in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Tax Policy He added that his department does not favor `` special income-tax rules for airlines or for any other specific industry.'' In his testimony, <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said the $ 4 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, was not motivated by tax factors. `` If the tax treatment of debt had been changed to make the after-tax cost of interest greater, I do not necessarily feel that this would have discouraged the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` The fundamental attractiveness of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> as a business would remain unchanged.'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> also said that while <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was part of the group that bought <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, `` We ceded no control of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>.'' He noted that <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> got only 5 percent of the voting stock and one out of 12 seats on the board of directors. `` Each acquisition and acquirer should be evaluated individually,'' he told the panel.

<HEAD>UAL Stock Volatile; Pilots Haven't Given Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A plunge, and then a late rally, in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock is keeping many eyes on the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, despite its board's insistence that it is backing away from an immediate sale. In Tuesday's trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> finished down $ 8.37 -LCB- at $ 170 a share, rallying on late buying interest after dropping more than $ 32 early in the day. The closing price represented just over half the $ 300 a share originally offered by a buyout group that included <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s management and pilots. The United chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it was undaunted in its quest for an employee-owned airline. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said the late rally in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price might be a sign of possible takeover interest from outside. `` We told our pilots tonight on the telephone hotline that we know, from sources, that someone is accumulating <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock, but who that is we do not know,'' <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. The company's board said late Monday the Chicago-based airline would remain independent while directors examine alternatives to the $ 6.75 billion offer that collapsed earlier this month. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, another union involved in the original buyout attempt, said her union was not happy with the board's stand. `` We do n't know what anyone's going to do at this point in time,'' Friend said. `` All we're saying is that we believe the board of directors have made a mistake because they have not taken any action to protect the company from hostile takeovers.'' Airline analyst <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board's statement gives the pilot-management group breathing room to regroup and possibly come back with another buyout proposal. `` All the messages here are, ` Let's take a breather, stand back, let management run the company.' It's a holding pattern until a firm bid hits the table,'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said the pilots continued to work behind the scenes in an attempt to put together another package. `` The players, the pilots, their financial advisers ... have n't packed up their bags and gone home by any means,'' he said `` We'll just regroup and see what we can do in the future. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an airline analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> firm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the decline in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock is `` making any potential bid cheaper all the time. It's just a reaction to the board's decision to do nothing.'' And the more the stock price falls, the more attractive <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> is to hostile raiders, <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading early Tuesday, in part due to concerns about <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, though there was some recovery after noon. The pilot-management group's announcement Oct. 13 that it was unable to obtain financing for its bid helped trigger a 190.58-point drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average and launched the downward slide for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. The widely followed market index finished down 3.69 Tuesday at 2,659.22 after a day of volatile movement. In addition to the inability to raise financing, the buyout suffered another major setback last week when <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> _ which was to contribute $ 750 million in equity in exchange for a 15 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> _ pulled out of the buyout group.

 Speculation that the hot pace of car and truck sales in late summer would cool is coming true, with automakers reporting a 20.5 percent drop in vehicle sales in mid-October compared with the same period last year. Part of the analysts' predictions of weak sales in October came from consumers' fear of price increases for 1990-model cars, which were introduced this month, and attractive buyer incentives in August and September. The combination apparently proved too much to resist for some consumers who had planned to buy cars this fall. Car sales reported Tuesday by the Big Three automakers fell more than 20 percent each, with light truck sales not far behind. The eight major automakers with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 28,156 during Oct. 11-20, compared with a rate of 35,407 during the same time last year. Overall car sales were off 19 percent while truck sales were down 22.8 percent. As the 1990 model year opened, automakers announced price increases they blamed mostly on federal safety requirements, including driver-side air bags or automatic safety belts. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a 3.4 percent average price increase for its 1990 model cars, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s prices rose an average of 4.9 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s went up 5 percent on average. The manufacturers also carried over cash rebates or low-interest financing packages to some 1990 cars and trucks, but they did n't match the level of incentives on 1989 models Some dealers still have 1989 cars and trucks in stock, but the majority sold now are 1990 models. The mid-October sales decline, when tacked on to the 11.9 percent drop in early-October sales figures, worked out to a 16.5 percent decline in vehicle sales during the first 20 days of the month compared with the same period last year. `` We borrowed some business from October, November and December,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Adcox </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Adcox </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and the incoming treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` That usually happens when you have a strong close -LRB- to the model year -RRB- like this.'' In September, car and light truck sales by the eight companies were up 8.2 percent over the same month last year. In August, vehicle sales were up 13.1 percent compared with August 1988. So far this calendar year, car and truck sales are running 2 percent behind the last year's pace, the second-best on record. Car sales are down 3 percent and light-truck sales were down 0.2 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> reported its car sales were down 24.8 percent during mid-October compared with last year, while <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck sales were off 26 percent. For the year-to-date, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 6.8 percent while truck sales were up 1.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its mid-October car sales ran 21.2 percent behind last year and truck sales were down 24.2 percent. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were 0.6 percent behind last year and truck sales were down 2.7 percent Mid-October car sales at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> were down 23.7 percent and truck sales were off 17.5 percent. Since the first of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were 11.5 percent behind last year and truck sales were down 0.4 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it's ready, more than a year early, to bid for all of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock, but that it may not go after the British luxury carmaker when the time comes. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> apparently will have to wait until the end of next year before it could move to acquire more than 15 percent of the company because of an ownership roadblock written into <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s bylaws. A suitor can acquire more than 15 percent of the stock before then, but it must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. And that seems unlikely in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s case. The notification by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that it was prepared to bid for all of the stock stemmed from an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> requirement, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>. `` It is a legal requirement by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> that once you became a 5 percent stockholder in the company, you have to disclose your intentions concerning the issuer, which is <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` It's not saying that we are going after it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have made separate moves to acquire chunks of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> through stock purchases that <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> has called unwelcome and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> through friendly negotiations with company. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's Nos. 1 and 2 automakers respectively, apparently want a luxury automobile to add to their stables, and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, which has fallen on tough financial times, seems to fit the bill. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 75 cents a share to close at $ 49.125 Tuesday, and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents to close at $ 11.25 in over-the-counter trading. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> reported a 22.4 percent decline in sales of its cars and light trucks during mid-October compared with the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, like other overseas automakers, wo n't report <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales until the first of next month Because of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> bylaws, no outside individual or company may acquire more than 15 percent of its stock before Dec. 31, 1990, without a vote by <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. After that date, there are no provisions in place that would thwart a hostile takeover through stock purchases. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> has said it wants to remain independent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> announced Sept. 19 that it planned to acquire 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, and received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory approval for the purchase. By Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had accumulated 21.9 million shares, or about 12 percent, of the company's outstanding stock. A <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> move to acquire all of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s stock may be dealt a blow sooner than the end of next year. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> has said he hopes to make an announcement to shareholders within a month about the matter, spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary said Tuesday. It is possible that such an announcement would involve <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, which reportedly has been negotiating to buy up to 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> stock within the next few years. `` We are continuing in our discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> regarding several possible business arrangements, including manufacturing, marketing and other activities,'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Theis </PERSON> said Tuesday. He said <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said last week the discussions included a product for the European market. `` We have declined to get any more specific than that,'' <PERSON> Theis </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will get a hand from <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in promoting its portable video `` Game Boy'' that analysts say could be one of the most popular presents under Christmas trees this year. But <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> says the transistor radio-sized, handheld device has such blockbuster potential that the company wo n't have enough of them this Christmas to meet even half of the projected demand. `` We expect to sell out,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, director of advertising and public relations for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd.. White said <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> forecasts the holiday demand for Game Boy at 2 million to 2.5 <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> will ship just over 1 million units, and another 4 million to 5 million next year, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday they would team up in a two-month promotion starting Nov. 1 during which <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> will award more than 4,000 Game Boys to consumers. For <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, the campaign could be a bonanza if it encourages many more consumers to buy <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> beverages for a chance to obtain what could become a hard-to-find holiday gift. `` We hope to be in the forefront of consumers' minds during the holidays,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We hope to make the <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> brand name synonymous with the hottest toy of the holiday season.'' Toy industry analysts agree that <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> appears to have another big hit on its hands with Game Boy, which retails for $ 89.95. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s entertainment system that turns a television into a game screen dominates the home-computer-game business. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourdon </PERSON>, spokeswoman for retailer <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Us </ORGANIZATION>, said Game Boy has been a strong seller since its release in August. `` It's the No. 1 best seller for Christmas,'' she said. `` Hands down.'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a retail analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had a similar view. `` The Game Boy is going to have a tremendous Christmas,'' she said. Added <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reysen </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> Playthings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, `` People are asking if this is the next Cabbage Patch,'' referring to the dolls that were a toy industry sensation in the mid-1980s. <PERSON> Reysen </PERSON> said he doubts Game Boy will achieve megahit status in the same league as the Cabbage Patch dolls. With such a hefty pricetag, Game Boy wo n't be for everyone. But <PERSON> Reysen </PERSON> said Game Boy could trigger a turnaround in the handheld video game category, which has been in the doldrums for several years. Game Boy uses interchangeable cartridges _ but not the same ones as used on <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s regular TV-based system. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 10 million promotion with <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> will be supported by radio and television advertisements plus in-store, point-of-purchase displays. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> said it would create special TV and radio ads for network and local broadcasts. Customers will have a chance at winning a Game Boy or certain other items through an instant-win, under-the-cap giveaway on specially marked packages of Pepsi products. The other prizes include <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> Action Sets, U-Force Remotes for use with the <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> Game Paks, $ 5 <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> vouchers and free coupons for two-liter <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> products. The contest will be featured on 16-oz. non-returnable, one-liter, two-liter and three-liter packages of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Diet </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepsi </PERSON>, both diet and regular Caffeine Free Pepsi, <LOCATION> Moutain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dew </LOCATION> and Lemon-Lime Slice. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> is hoping this year's holiday promotion will have results similar to last year's, when <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> sponsored the home video release of <ORGANIZATION> MCA-Universal </ORGANIZATION>'s `` E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial'' and offered special $ 5 rebates. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, the 1988 promotion generated a record 1.6 million rebates and helped `` E.T.'' become the highest-selling home video in history.

<TEXT>
 The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today and stock prices fell in afternoon trading, erasing earlier gains. The dollar finished trading at 141.55 yen, down 0.55 yen from Tuesday's close of 142.10 yen. After opening at 141.57 yen, it stayed in a narrow range between 141.40 and 141.79 yen. `` Recently the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency has n't been falling much in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> because Japanese investors still have large dollar demands,'' said <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakao </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. But he said traders in other countries had become less interested in the dollar because of recent declines in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. Lower interest rates in a country tend to make its currency less attractive to investors. Japanese participants also were concerned about recent losses on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following its big plunge two weeks ago, he said. On the stock market, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> shed 84.15 points, or 0.24 percent, ending the day's trading at 35,442.40. The index, which lost 58.97 points the previous day, gained 71.90 points in the morning, but fell back in afternoon trading. The index started falling as investors began selling issues to take profits from the morning gains, dealers said. `` Many participants also stepped off to the sidelines to wait to see the performance of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market tonight,'' said <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

 A projected glut of new cars over the next two years wo n't affect production plans at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> plant because the compact model will attract buyers of imports, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s president said. `` We're not after people who are already driving Chevrolets.

<HEAD>Two New Roadsters Introduced by Mercedes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A pair of new two-seat roadsters and a new four-wheel-drive sedan and station wagon will lead <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>'s fight to hold its share of the growing luxury car market, a company executive says. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday he expected the luxury market to grow to about 840,000 cars next year, about 10,000 more than 1989 sales. <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> also said he expected the company to keep or slightly increase its 75,000-car-a-year sales pace of 1989. The four cars that the West German automaker introduced will lead a list of 17 models into the next decade. The 300SL, with a base price of $ 73,500, and the 500SL, which costs $ 10,000 more, replace the Mercedes 560SL, a roadster the West German automaker had been producing for 18 years. Mercedes also is selling a sedan and a station wagon, carrying 300E and 300TE designations respectively, with automatically engaging four-wheel-drive, a first for the company. Some of the competition Mercedes will face in 1990 will come from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last month began selling its Lexus luxury cars and next month, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will begin selling its Infiniti line. `` They will try to take customers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- automakers -RRB- as well as Europeans,'' <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> said. `` What the effect will be still has to be seen. There is no clear picture yet. `` We do view them with a lot of respect,'' he said. `` We believe they will be worthy competitors.'' The median price for a Mercedes in 1989 was about $ 45,000, <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> said, slightly above the $ 40,000 price for the top-of-the-line Lexus or Infiniti model. <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> doubted speculation that the Japanese companies were keeping their prices low in order to grab larger shares of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> luxury-car market. `` They are certainly out with an interesting price,'' he said. `` I think it would be very disrespectful to say they buy market share. I'm not happy that they're around at these prices, but I understand why.'' <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> said he expected the two new SL models to account for about 8,000 in sales apiece and the four-wheel-drive cars, called 4Matic, will account for about 1,000 in sales each. The four-wheel-drive system is a complex series of sensors that automatically add front-wheel-drive to existing rear-wheel-drive when certain limits of wheel spin, engine speed and other factors are passed. Drivers have to do nothing for the system to engage or disengage. Next year, Mercedes plans to introduce two new turbodiesel cars, which should amount to about 4,000 in sales in 1990. <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> acknowledged reports that the new turbodiesels do not meet stringent <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> air quality standards, meaning that the state with some of the company's largest markets will be off limits for the diesel cars. The rest of the country, he said, accounts for 75 percent of Mercedes sales.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries on Wednesday opposed new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals for the liberalization of farm trade, saying they were impractical. <PERSON> Michihiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kano </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> committee, `` We believe there are some problems in the realization of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals from a standpoint of the world agricultural situation and the position in which Japanese farmers are being placed,'' a parliamentary official said. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will maintain its current stand,'' particularly its policy of self-sufficiency in rice, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted <LOCATION> Kano </LOCATION> as saying. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday a four-point package calling for all farm trade import barriers to be turned into tariffs and gradually reduced over 10 years, and for the abolishment of all export subsidies in five years. Under the proposals, to be submitted Wednesday to international farm trade liberalization talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would be able to protect its rice production with a high tariff at first, but would have to gradually lower it to nearly zero in 10 years. Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told the parliamentary committee the government would continue to implement a policy of self-sufficiency on rice. Japanese officials maintain that rice, as a staple food, should be protected, and that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should continue its policy for security reasons. The Japanese government regulates the domestic rice market, buying much of the rice produced by Japanese farmers and reselling it to consumers at lower prices, which are still several times the world market level.

 Statistics showing that black mortgage applicants are rejected twice as often as whites indicate federal regulators are n't trying hard enough to enforce discrimination laws, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee chairman says. `` The problem today is not lack of laws, it is lackluster enforcement,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the consumer and regulatory affairs panel Blacks applying for mortgages at savings institutions are rejected approximately twice as often as whites, according to data collected since 1978 by the Office of Thrift Supervision. However, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, senior deputy at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said only 16 of the 37,000 written complaints received by his agency between January 1987 and August 1989 alleged racial discrimination in mortgage lending. All 16 were investigated and no violations were found, he said. Studies by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> show that predominantly black neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> received fewer home purchase loans than white neighborhoods with similar income levels. `` I'm not a statistician, but when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites ... I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said Tuesday. Regulators told his panel the data does n't prove violations by financial institutions, which are prohibited from discriminating against potential borrowers on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin or family status. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiechter </PERSON>, senior deputy director of the thrift office, said the statistics `` only suggest the possibility of unequal treatment'' because they do n't include information on the income or credit worthiness of mortgage applicants. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said differences in lending to black and white neighborhoods could be explained in part by differences in demand for mortgages. Moreover, regulators said their examinations find few banks not living up to their obligations. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovenzi </PERSON>, deputy to the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said only 21 of 6,515 banks examined for redlining violations in 1986, 1987 and 1988 received less than satisfactory ratings. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON> said discrimination is often difficult to detect because it can occur when institutions subtly discourage loan applications from minorities. When there are no applications, there are no audit trails for examiners to follow, they said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishbein </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION>, an activist group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> could remedy that by expanding its use of `` testers.'' `` Testing'' is an investigative technique using matched pairs of homeseekers _ minority and non-minority _ who are otherwise similarly qualified. Financial institutions have resisted the use of that tactic even though it is already used to detect discrimination by real estate and rental agents.

 The stock market was mixed today in an atmosphere of uncertainty after Tuesday's volatile session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.35 to 2,652.87 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in the early tally of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 497 up, 461 down and 479 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 23.95 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in early trading Tuesday, and then rebounded to recoup most of its loss. Analysts said that typified the recent volatile behavior that has put many investors on their guard. In addition, traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in advance of the government's report Thursday morning on the gross national product for the third quarter of the year. The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic growth, possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but also raising questions about the outlook for corporate profits.

 The new head of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told a congressional panel today the handling of Wall Street's 190 point plunge on Oct. 13 shows `` the value of the market improvements adopted during the past two years.'' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, who noted `` I was sworn into office just two weeks ago today,'' was the star witness before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on market reform, his first public appearance since taking office. It also was <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>'s first public questioning since the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 190.58 points on Oct. 13. The Dow Jones average, a key market indicator, rebounded to close up 88.12 points the following Monday. After a week of gentler fluctuations, it seesawed again Tuesday, finishing the day with a slight decline of 3.69 points at 2,659.22. `` We learned important lessons from the market turbulence of Oct. 13 and Oct. 16 and the market's responses to it,'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said in testimony prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s telecommunications and finance subcommittee. `` The volume surges and volatility experienced on those two days exemplify fundamental changes in our markets; they were not isolated instances. We should not panic in the face of these events, however. For what was demonstrated on Oct. 13 and 16 was the strength and resiliency of the nation's markets.'' He noted that more shares were traded in one hour during the Oct. 13 slide `` than were traded on the average full day in 1985'' and three times the market's average daily volume 10 years ago. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> also said communication among the financial markets was excellent and circuit-breakers, temporary trading halts in options to slow market volatility also worked well. Legislation is pending in both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the House that would expand the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s powers to monitor the markets in several ways, some of them opposed by various segments of the industry and one _ giving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> the power to halt trading in emergencies _ opposed by <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> himself. The other proposed changes include giving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> authority to request reports on large securities and options trades. This power would enhance the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s surveillence abilities to track who's trading what to whom Another would require rules for assessing the financial soundness of holding companies that are the parent companies of broker-dealers. The other witnesses slated to testify are: <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association representing 600 securities firms; and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>, chairman of the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of mutual funds. The market reforms proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> include giving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman the authority to halt trading for up to 24 hours in emergenies. Currently, only the president can order such a shutdown. But <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> has said he does not want that power and does not think it should be exercised. In written answers to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staffers' questions during confirmation hearings for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> post, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said such authority would create too much uncertainty about when the markets would close and for how long. `` In a crisis, this uncertainty and the related rumors concerning its likelihood could have seriously adverse consequences,'' he wrote last month.

 Wall Street took on a calmer tone today following Tuesday's roller-coaster ride in which stock prices swung wildly, depressing the dollar and boosting demand for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 6.35 to 2,652.87 in the first half hour of trading today. But in the broader market, rising stocks held a small edge over losers. The Dow average plummeted as much as 85 points on Tuesday before rebounding and closing down 3.69 points at 2,659.22. Analysts said the tone for Tuesday's market gyrations was set by two factors: speculation that a collapsed deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> signaled a continued ebbing of the takeover tide, and concern that a slowing economy would lead to weaker corporate profits. On Wall Street, program trading strategies involving millions of shares of stock helped accentuate wild declines and rebounds in stock prices, some analysts said. `` It was almost all computerized program trading that gave us tremendous violent price swings,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, a technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't think you could put your finger on any underlying economic statistic.'' In other financial markets Tuesday, the dollar ended lower against most major currencies, moving in tandem with the stock market and reflecting concern from foreign investors about the shakiness of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets. But <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds posted moderate gains, with the bellwether 30-year bond up -LCB- point, or $ 5 per $ 1,000 face amount. Treasury bonds, which are guaranteed by the government, are considered a safe haven at times of financial instability. Stock market observers initially attributed the downturn to the decision late Monday by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> to forego an employee-management buyout for the time being, and a surge Tuesday in computerized program selling involving stock-index futures. In such program selling, traders using sophisticated computer programs take advantage of minute price discrepancies between stock-index futures and the actual stocks on which the futures contracts are based. The <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout group's Oct. 13 announcement that it could n't raise financing for its $ 6.75 billion bid, and program selling that followed, were considered key factors in the Dow's 190-point plunge that day Stocks regained much of their losses last week, however. `` It's certainly reminiscent of Friday the 13th ... although it's not a replay,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, chief investment officer for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. Analysts said program trades dominated Tuesday's buying and selling. `` I did n't see a lot of individuals, or even institutions, participating,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` By and large they seemed to be fence sitting.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagle </PERSON>, vice president and director of technical research at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said program trading was accelerating the current bearishness apparent in the stock market. `` What we have here is an intermediate correction in an otherwise bull market,'' he said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- we've just seen it happen in a matter of days instead of weeks as we normally do. `` We're getting compressed moves both on the upside and the downside ... due to program trading.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the fixation on the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout represented concerns about the future of leveraged buyouts. `` It's not the final nail in the coffin of leveraged buyouts or acquisitions, but it's pretty darn close to it,'' he said. `` The LBO business had been the principal drive of the stock market for most of 1988 and 1989.'' Analysts also pinned the blame on the lower stock prices on weakness in the economy and its effects on corporate profits. Those concerns were magnified by a government report Tuesday showing that orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods declined 0.1 percent during September. `` The economy's heartbeat is not very strong and that is n't good news for stocks,'' said <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said today he opposes a bill that would subject the central bank to more supervision from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration. However, congressional supporters of the measure said it was needed to make the secretive central bank more accountable for its actions, which can have enormous impact on the $ 5 trillion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> must take actions that, while sometimes unpopular in the short run, are in the long-run best interests of the country,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said, adding that `` the independence of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has, in practice, served the country well.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was the lead-off witness as a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee opened hearings to examine how the central bank and its chairman, often called the second most powerful man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, reach decisions on setting interest rates. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was opposed to a bill sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, which would require <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials to meet at specified times with the administration and release immediately results of its closed-door deliberations While rejecting these proposals, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> did endorse another measure sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, that would write into law that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s chief mission is to eliminate inflation and establish a deadline of 1994 for having done so. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said, however, that wringing inflation out of the economy over the next five years would have short-tem costs in terms of slower growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton-Dorgan </ORGANIZATION> proposal also calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s budget, which currently is not reviewed by either <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the administration, to be subject to review and would require that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s books be audited each year by congressional auditors. It also would make the chairman's term start one year after the start of a presidential term. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said all those changes would compromise the political independence of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, which he said was essential to the central bank's main role of fighting inflation. In arguing for his proposal, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said, `` The purpose of our bill is to increase the accountability of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people by making the workings of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> more open and by establishing a formal channel of communications between policymakers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton-Dorgan </ORGANIZATION> measure originally called for the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to be added to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s key policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee. That panel, composed of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and presidents of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s regional banks, meets secretly eight times a year to set interest rate policies. Decisions are n't made public for six weeks after a meeting, and even then only abbreviated minutes of the closed-door sessions are made available. The revised Hamilton-Dorgan bill drops the effort to put the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy board and instead calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> panel to meet twice each year with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary and other top administration officials. It also calls for the immediate release of the minutes of the meeting. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s measure does not include any penalties if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> fails to meet the five-year deadline for eliminating inflation. Consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent through the first nine months of this year. Current law directs the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to `` promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates'' but says nothing about the trade-offs between these sometimes-conflicting goals. `` The law as it is presently written is so broad that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can do anything and say that they are following the law,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said in arguing for his proposal. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s original legislation was much more specific in calling on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to reduce by 1 percent a year until it had reached zero inflation. His new version, revamped to meet <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s objections, simply calls for the elimination of inflation in five years and paraphrases language <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has used to say that `` inflation will be deemed to be eliminated when the expected rate of change of the general level of prices ceases to be a factor in individual and business decisions making.'' Even the revised bills are given little chance of passing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, especially in light of objections from key members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Soviets Announce Big Decrease in Ruble's Value For Travel</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with details of devaluation. ADDS byline.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced today that it was dramatically devaluing the ruble for people and businesses needing convertible currency to travel abroad. The new rate of 6.26 rubles to the dollar is a tacit admission that the ruble is not worth anything near the existing official rate of .6277 per dollar. It means that Soviet travelers, instead of receiving $ 1.59 per ruble, will instead get about 16 cents. The announcement, reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, indicated the standard rate will remain in effect for most transactions, such as for foreign firms doing business in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and for most international trade with the West. `` The special rate will be used by banking institutions in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> when selling hard currencies ... to citizens traveling abroad on personal matters and when purchasing such currencies,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It will also be used when selling hard currencies ... to state, cooperative and other public and other enterprises for business trips of their workers abroad.'' One Western diplomatic analyst, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the announcement could mark `` an initial step toward eventual convertibility of the ruble'' on international currency exchanges. But the source called it too small a step to have any obvious effect on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s foreign trade status. Because the ruble can not be freely exchanged for dollars, yen, marks and other hard currencies, it has virtually no value outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet citizens have long been allowed to exchange just 200 rubles for travel abroad. Tens of thousands of Soviets making trips to the West thus trade rubles for dollars on the black market and smuggle cash out of the country. A tremendous increase in the number of Soviets being permitted to travel abroad under the more open climate created by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms has been blamed by Western observers for a sharp decline in the black-market value of the ruble. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, which approved the measure, characterized the change as an attempt to attract more foreign tourists, curb the black market and encourage Soviet citizens with hard-currency bank accounts to exchange them for rubles, thus increasing the state bank's hard-currency reserves. The announcement did not indicate foreign tourists would be allowed to buy rubles at the new rate, so it was not clear how the move could affect foreign tourism. The spokesman, <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovcharenko </PERSON> of the Council of Ministers press office, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the new rule would take effect Nov. 1. The new rate, if accompanied by a lifting of the limit on official exchanges, would give Soviet travelers a more attractive, legal alternative than the black market for buying hard currency. The growing disparity between the official rate and black-market rates tends to feed anxieties about the nation's tenuous economic condition. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> gave no explanation for the devaluation, and <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlovsky </PERSON>, deputy chief of the joint currency economics department of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, refused to give more details on the decision. He would say only that it had been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>. The Council of Foreign Ministers in December ordered up a plan for partial convertibility of the ruble, beginning with a 50 percent devaluation on Jan. 1, 1990. Making the ruble convertible would destroy the Soviet pricing system, under which industrial goods and raw materials are cheap and consumer goods are expensive.

 As a 22-year-old exchange student, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> decided to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pursue an auto sunroof business. His decision grew into the <ORGANIZATION> ASC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> car conversion empire, and at age 47, <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> is spending weeks at a time at a new ASC facility, back in his native <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The man who left boyhood in rural <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> to chase the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream now has a foothold for expansion in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> of 1992 and beyond. `` We are a company with truly worldwide activities. For a small company like ours, that's unusual,'' he said. <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON>, who became a naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1972, has built a reputation in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> economic development circles and a role in Republican politics that includes advising the president on international competitiveness. He said he realized early that stability for <ORGANIZATION> ASC </ORGANIZATION> would depend on international marketing, in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A recession in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> earlier this decade punctuated the lesson. Between jet trips to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> recently led a visitor through a chrome-decorated studio at <ORGANIZATION> ASC </ORGANIZATION>'s Southgate headquarters. Getting his hands on the cars still makes him smile, and he showed how the convertible top drops into concealment on a gold special-edition Ford Mustang. Also gleaming under the lights were <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>, Acura, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> convertibles made by <ORGANIZATION> ASC </ORGANIZATION>, and a bright yellow soft-top Jeep. Raised in rural postwar <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` I grew up as a farm boy and of course there were no cars,'' <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> said. He left home at 13 to work as an apprentice in his uncle's auto coach-building shop in <LOCATION> Nuremburg </LOCATION>, attending high school at night. He went on to engineering school, and traveled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1963 to attend <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> as an exchange student in engineering. In 1965, he quit school but decided to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and opened <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunroof </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with $ 750 worth of tools in a two-car garage rented from custom car designer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Barris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> began selling hand-cut, hand-formed metal sunroofs, new to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the time. A visiting <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive asked him to do prototype work for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> soon moved his business to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ASC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> now has about 30 facilities and employs about 3,000 people crafting special editions, convertibles and prototypes for the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carmakers and overseas makers including <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>. The newest plant, in <LOCATION> Heilbrun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, does the convertible conversion of the Porsche 944 Cabriolet. <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> also owns an interest in <LOCATION> Karosserie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Werke </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Weinsberg </LOCATION>, which does advanced bodywork for makers such as BMW, <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Opel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>. In the industrial area south of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> is dubbed the `` Duke of Downriver'' because of his holdings. He owns <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, including a chain of 16 suburban newspapers; the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> real estate company; the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> near the <ORGANIZATION> ASC </ORGANIZATION> complex in <LOCATION> Southgate </LOCATION>; and the <LOCATION> Portside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Wyandotte </LOCATION>. He owns a 5 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He does n't reveal figures on his privately held enterprises. <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> said he allocates one-fourth of his time for community and political affairs. He is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Downriver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metroplex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a business and community leaders' group. He is active in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> economic development groups as well. He was one of about a dozen investors who saved <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from closing by purchasing the culinary landmark in January. <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> is a busy Republican fund-raiser. He was active in fund-raising events that brought in nearly a million dollars for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. `` It's now day one after the election and I'm dead tired,'' begins a handwritten note of thanks from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> keeps on his desk. `` He was very active in raising money for the president and for the state party, in 1988 in particular,'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> said. `` He's clearly somebody who has a real, honest, philosophical commitment to the political process.'' His opinion appears to matter, though he has no interest in seeking office himself. The Prechters attended a White House state dinner for the visiting prime minister of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> was seated next to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` My vision always was to make a difference in what I do,'' he said. `` I first and foremost want to be a businessman.'' That means pursuing international ties he began establishing in 1971, when few courted <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> business. Now he tries to unravel European import restrictions and other red tape, to prepare for the planned integration of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1992, when trade barriers theoretically will be abolished. European business leaders rely more heavily than Americans on business and social contacts within a rigid old boy network, <PERSON> Prechter </PERSON> said. `` We are not used to the strict conformist orientation of society there. `` America is such a flexible place, and such an easy place. That is one of the reasons we are not an export-oriented country.''

<HEAD>Reports Record Earnings for First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported record first-quarter earnings Wednesday, a 24.1 percent increase over the year-ago period. Earnings for the three months ending Sept. 30, the company's first fiscal quarter, rose to $ 93.8 million from $ 75.6 million for the same period last year, the <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said in a statement Earnings per share increased 15.4 percent to 75 cents, compared with 65 cents a year ago. The lower percentage increase in earnings per share is due to a higher level of preferred dividends and more common shares outstanding in the current quarter, the Chicago-based company said. Quarterly sales totaled $ 2.7 billion, down 0.1 percent from last year's level, due to the disposition of <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s food service business at the beginning of their 1990 first quarter. `` Earnings growth remained strong during the quarter,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` In spite of restructuring our foodservice business which resulted in an annual loss of more than $ 1 billion in sales, our core operations reported solid results, with outstanding performance in our personal products businesses.'' <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> makes and sells packaged food and consumer products such as printed T-shirts and hosiery.

<UNK>Norfolk Southern Reports Third Quarter Earnings Down 16.1 Percent</UNK>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that third-quarter earnings declined 16.1 percent because of a decrease in non-coal revenues and rising expenses. Earnings for the third quarter was $ 150.5 million or 87 cents a share, the railroad and transportation company said. Earnings for the third quarter of 1988 totaled $ 179.4 million or $ 1 a share. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>, the company's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the decline in merchandise revenues reflected a flattening of the economy. `` There were some bright spots,'' he said. `` Strong exports and utility markets produced a 2.4 percent growth in coal revenues, while increased production at the new auto plants on our lines accounted for a 2.4 percent increase in automobile revenues.'' Earnings for the first nine months of 1989 totaled $ 458 million or $ 2.61 a share, up 0.4 percent from the first nine months of 1988 when earnings totaled $ 456.1 million or $ 2.51 a share. Transportation operating revenue was down 1.8 percent to $ 1.14 billion for the third quarter of 1989 when compared to the third quarter of 1988. Of that amount, railway revenues declined 1.8 percent to $ 903.3 million and motor carrier revenues dipped 1.7 percent to $ 238.8 million. Total transportation operating expenses increased 5.4 percent in the third quarter, to $ 941.4 million, and 7.9 percent for the first nine months, to just under $ 2.8 billion. For the nine months, total transportation operating revenues were $ 3.43 billion, up 3.8 percent from $ 3.30 billion a year earlier. Railway operating revenues rose 3.9 percent and motor carrier revenues rose 3.2 percent. Nine-month transportation operating expenses rose 7.2 percent, with railway expenses up 7.9 percent and motor carrier expenses up 4.9 percent.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that weakening steel markets helped cut its third-quarter earnings by more than half to $ 46.9 million, or 53 cents per share. In the 1988 third quarter, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> earned $ 101.4 million, or $ 1.18 per share. Sales fell 7.9 percent from $ 1.32 billion to $ 1.22 billion in the comparable three-month periods. `` We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, chairman of the nation's second-largest steelmaker. The company's steel-related segment operated at a loss of $ 8 million during the quarter and $ 128 million loss for the first nine months. Operating losses were $ 80 million and $ 97 million respectively in the 1988 periods. Nine-month profits fell nearly 42 percent from $ 337 million, or $ 4.17 per share, to $ 196 million, or $ 2.28 per share. Sales slid slightly from $ 4.16 billion to $ 4.10 billion.

 The stock market edged upward today in an atmosphere of uncertainty after Tuesday's volatile session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.38 to 2,666.60 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 754 up, 661 down and 471 unchanged. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in early trading Tuesday, and then rebounded to recoup most of its loss. Analysts said that typified the recent volatile behavior that has put many investors on their guard. In addition, traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in advance of the government's report Thursday morning on the gross national product for the third quarter of the year. The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic growth, possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but also raising questions about the outlook for corporate profits. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> made a big contribution to the Dow Jones industrials' gain, climbing 3 -RRB- to 118 The company reported higher third-quarter earnings, raised its dividend and disclosed plans for a 3-for-1 stock split.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Wednesday to finance a television show featuring home repair expert <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>, who was forced to leave a similar program in a conflict of interest dispute. The new television show, tentatively named `` Home Again with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>,'' will be co-sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and syndicated nationally, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based retailer. Ms. <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON> said she believes it's the first time the retail giant has sponsored and syndicated a television show. Vila, longtime host of the Emmy Award-winning <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> show `` This Old House,'' also has been signed as the exclusive spokesman for all <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> home improvements products, the retailer said in a news release. The new weekly half-hour show will feature do-it-yourself remodeling jobs the average consumer can afford. It's scheduled to begin airing in the spring of 1990. <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> was host of `` This Old House'' from its national debut in 1979 until early last spring, when his annual contract was not renewed. <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> had been doing commercials for a competitor of a major local underwriter of the show, which is produced by <ORGANIZATION> WGBH-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON>, publicist for `` This Old House.'' `` He had agreed to give up some of his commercial activities, if we could indemnify him for the loss of income,'' she said by telephone Monday. The station chose not to do so and decided not to renew his contract, she said. <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> has appeared in advertising as a spokesman for a number of commercial enterprises, including Time-Life home repair books; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, a heat pump maker; <ORGANIZATION> Amerock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a cabinet and storage hardware maker; and <ORGANIZATION> Boyle-Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, makers of Easy Off oven cleaner. `` The vast majority of his prior endorsements have been terminated,'' said <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>'s agent, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, but he declined to say whether that was a provision of his deal with <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> will continue to appear in Time-Life ads, <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON> said. The new show is not designed to be a competitor with `` This Old House,'' said <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>. `` It's going to be a show that's absolutely going to stand on its own,'' he said. <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>'s production company, <ORGANIZATION> B.V.T.V. </ORGANIZATION>, will create 39 original programs for the new show, with 13 reruns making up the balance of a full-year schedule, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said. Commercial time for the half-hour segments will be divided between <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and non-competing advertisers, the retailer said. <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON> said the bitterness <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> felt after being forced to leave PBS has disappeared. `` He's looking to the future now,'' <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Calling it toxic waste dumping and the second Opium War, anti-smoking crusaders in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> have accused American tobacco interests of moving to reverse victories scored against the cigarette by targeting the booming <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> as a key market. The American companies, faced with anti-smoking regulations that depress profits in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, say the budding anti-smoking movement in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is an excuse for trade protectionism. American cigarettes entered the once closed markets of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1986 and now tobacco companies are trying to penetrate <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. American cigarettes historically have been hot sellers in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Asian smoking opponents claim the American hard sell and slick ads equating smoking with the good life will create a new generation of smoking addicts, especially women and teen-agers. `` Smoking foreign cigarettes has become a symbol of money and social status,'' the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> stated recently, noting the price of a couple of cartons of Marlboros equal a Chinese professor's monthly salary. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, an anti-smoking group called <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tung </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> claims smoking has soared among teen-agers because of hard-sell tactics by American tobacco companies. Eight-five percent of youthful puffers prefer imports, the Tung group says. In a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier this year, health groups from nine <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries described the American push as `` a mockery of your country's efforts to curb the export of other addictive drugs into your country.'' Activists have likened the American blitz to last century's Opium War when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> forcefully flooded <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with opium from its colony <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and made addicts out of millions Those favoring increased exports, such as Congressman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a major tobacco-growing state, contend Asians will continue to buy cigarettes with or without <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presence. `` The real issue is whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies will be allowed to compete, or if the playing field is abandoned to other foreign manufacturers and local monopolies,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cigarette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> notes as part of its argument that cigarettes contributed a record $ 3.5 billion to help reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is threatening <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> with trade penalties if it does not lower its import tax and other barriers to American cigarettes. It is seeking the reversal of laws under which cigarette advertising was sharply restricted in 1979 and virtually eliminated from mass media this year. Thai anti-smoking lobbyists, some of whom recently testified in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, say their stand against American cigarettes is not a smokescreen for protectionism. `` My bottom line is anti-smoking. I do n't care if it's Thai or American cigarettes,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Prakit </PERSON> <PERSON> Vatee-Satokit </PERSON> of the Thai Anti-Smoking Campaign Project. `` I see people die of smoking every day.'' <PERSON> Prakit </PERSON> said he is concerned that a full-scale American entry will target youth and women. In a smoking profile typical of many Asian nations, only 3.5 percent of <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> women were said to smoke in 1988 vs. 46.6 percent of males. Led by 250 million Chinese, Asians remain among the world's most prolific puffers and account for 44 percent of global cigarette production. Governments take in hefty revenues from state monopolies and cigarette import taxes and thus are reluctant to take too tough a stand against their domestic industries. But private pressure groups and governments in some <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, inspired partly by the American anti-smoking movement, have made some notable gains in the tobacco war. Led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON>, a doctor turned politician, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> banned smoking in government offices in 1982 and all hospitals this year. Cigarette advertisements on television and radio, both government controlled, have been replaced by messages about smoking's harmful effects. But the Asian-Pacific Conference on Cigarette Smoking and Health, which sent the letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said American cigarette promoters in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> still place television ads for such things as `` Kent Travel Bags'' and `` Tours of Marlboro Country'' in which viewers are asked to call a local travel agency if they wish to visit `` Marlboro Country.'' <PERSON> Prakit </PERSON> says the number of <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> smokers has fallen sharply since 1976, partly because of an increased awareness of the health risks. The country beat the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in forbidding smoking on all domestic airline flights, a regulation that took effect this year. Anti-smoking campaigners got to Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> who gave up his trademark cigars recently. He's joked that his sex life has since improved. Other Asian leaders have set examples. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> abhors smoking in his presence and <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has banned it at Cabinet meetings. Those who light up on <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s buses, trains and taxis face fines of up to $ 250. But in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> the macho Marlboro Man still rides tall as television audiences are bombarded with this and other American cigarette ads long banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where American smokes dominate 70 percent of market, cigarette advertising is banned on prime time TV and will be banned from all programming by 1990. Controversy continues in the British colony and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> over tobacco industry sponsorships of sports and cultural programs. Anti-smoking has made little headway in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and only some in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where critics say American cigarettes are the most heavily advertised products in the country although the market share of imported cigarettes is still only about 4 percent. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where relatively expensive American cigarettes have captured only a miniscule percentage of the market, the government has not even imposed health warnings on packs. Top leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is a prolific smoker and is often photographed puffing on a domestic ` Panda'' brand. One flicker of interest was <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s participation in the first World Anti-Smoking Day last April. Stalls in the city sold `` anti-smoking ointments,'' `` quit smoking mouth gargles'' and battery powered electrodes attached to the cheeks and activated each time the user gets an urge to smoke. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where more than 60 percent of the people smoke, among the few places where smokers can not indulge are underground platforms of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s subway system. The sides of cigarette packs carry the faintly printed admonition: `` Be careful not to smoke too much for your health.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> remains one of the few industrialized nations to allow cigarette advertising on TV, where popular foreign actors such as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coburn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> promote smoking's glamorous image. The American incursion does not appear to have significantly affected smoking in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But the Asian-Pacific conference claimed that since the market was opened to Americans in 1987, cigarette ads on <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> television rose from No. 40 to second place in total air time. Japanese companies, the conference reported, have responded to stepped-up competition by copying Western-style advertising and concocting new products. These include a women-oriented brand, `` Misty,'' and another called `` Dean,'' named after deceased American actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, an idol among Japanese youth.

 The aim was admirable: Scratch extraneous words from a tongue-twisting trade code. But by deleting three, a government agency has mistakenly opened the nation's borders to cheap brooms _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> makers of a witch's favorite ride fear their sturdy, corn-bristle sweepers may never stroke another dirty floor `` It's thrown our industry into turmoil,'' says <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arcola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monahan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest supplier of corn-broom materials. `` We've seen them gearing up heavily in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' `` It's absolutely unbelievable,'' adds <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Libman </PERSON>, who runs an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> corn-broom company founded by his grandfather in 1896. The industry, which includes approximately 50 major producers making at least 20 million corn brooms a year, from whisk to floor models, says it's been dusted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In an effort to simplify language, the commission changed the section that put import restrictions and costly tariffs on brooms made `` wholly or partly of broom corn.'' The rules now apply only to brooms made `` of broom corn.'' The change got little attention until the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was recently asked to interpret the new code. Is a broom that is 28 percent to 43 percent corn bristle subject to the government's import limit The Customs Service said no. And with that green light, foreign producers now can stuff their brooms with cheap material such as grass or vegetable fibers, ship them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and market them as dependable corn brooms _ even though they are not the real thing, <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Libman </PERSON> said his company makes more than 1 million brooms a year at prices ranging from $ 6 to $ 8. Foreign brooms `` are selling for less than half,'' he said. `` It's not a good product. It lasts for a month and you throw it out. The consumer does n't know the difference.'' `` We're just a small industry,'' <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't afford to educate the public.'' A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who represents Mexican broom exporters said the American makers `` just do n't want competition.'' `` It's just hysteria,'' attorney <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glick </PERSON> said, dismissing claims that his clients make inferior brooms. `` My clients call them natural-fiber brooms. The Mexican industry is n't that big. A trade commission official acknowledged the mistake in a Oct. 13 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which enforces tariff policy. `` There was no intention on the commission's part to change the tariff treatment of whisk brooms and other brooms containing broom corn,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> wrote. `` The consequences this would have on the tariff treatment of these products were never brought to our attention ... when we could have done something about it,'' he said. `` So we understand that your hands are somewhat tied in interpreting the essential character of these products,'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> wrote. Some angry members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are pledging to rescue <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn-broom makers. Rep. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, D-Ill., whose district includes <LOCATION> Arcola </LOCATION>, introduced a bill Tuesday to correct the error Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is pushing similar legislation.

 The stock market struggled to a small gain today in an atmosphere of uncertainty after Tuesday's volatile session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.69 to 2,662.91 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 735 up, 677 down and 507 unchanged. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in early trading Tuesday, and then rebounded to recoup most of its loss. Analysts said that typified the recent volatile behavior that has put many investors on their guard. In addition, traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in advance of the government's report Thursday morning on the gross national product for the third quarter of the year. The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic growth, possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but also raising questions about the outlook for corporate profits. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> made a big contribution to the Dow Jones industrials' gain, climbing 2 | to 117 The company reported higher third-quarter earnings, raised its dividend and disclosed plans for a 3-for-1 stock split.

<HEAD>Iran Predicts Demand Could Mean End Of OPEC Quota System In Two Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil Minister <PERSON> Golamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> predicted Wednesday that world oil demand would grow so strongly in the next two years that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would abandon its current system of production limits. In a news conference with foreign reporters, <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would seek compensation for the destruction of offshore oil platforms by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces near the end of the Gulf war. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> did not give any specific growth rate predictions for world oil demand, but contended it would `` increase substantially'' over the next two years. `` We anticipate this demand will reach such a level that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota system will be abandoned altogether,'' <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said. `` As a result all members will be able to produce as much as necessary to meet demand, and the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota system will be abandoned.'' The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries now attempts to support a price of $ 18 a barrel for its crude oil through a system of voluntary production limits, or quotas, imposed on each of its 13 members. Prices have hovered somewhat below that level, partly because overproduction by some member nations has pushed <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output above the official ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day. Asked how prices would be set once the quota system was abolished, <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said `` there will be a long-term production and price strategy and by controlling production <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will be able to control price.'' `` Some very serious discussion over long-term strategy is taking place among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members,'' <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said. He gave no details on how long-term production would be controlled without quotas. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Veno </PERSON>, director of oil market analysis for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said demand in non-communist nations grew by 2.3 percent _ about 1.2 million barrels a day _ in the first three quarters of 1989 for total daily consumption of 51.2 million barrels. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s average production during that time was 21 million barrels a day, he said. Data Resources projects that worldwide demand growth will slow to 1.3 percent in 1990 and about 1.2 percent annually in the next three years. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> intends to seek compensation from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for destroying Iranian offshore oil platforms during the Gulf war. He did not say how much the compensation should be, but said total damage to his country's offshore oil installations during the eight-year war was $ 1.5 billion. Most of the damage resulted from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raids. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> attacked a number of Iranian oil platforms, which Iranian forces used as bases for attacks on neutral shipping. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main oil loading platform on <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which was raided repeatedly by Iranian jets, sustained $ 300 million worth of damage. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> planned to invest $ 8.4 billion in hard currency on petrochemical expansion projects over the next five years. If spending in local currency is included, total investment in such projects could reach two to three times that amount, he said. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> now earns $ 12 billion annually from oil and expects to earn $ 70 billion over the next five years. The current earnings were based on a daily production of about 3 million barrels per day, some 2 million barrels of which are exported. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said current production capacity was 3.5 million barrels a day, but it was not fully used, to conform to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s production quota of 2.92 million barrels a day set by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> He said expansion and reconstruction would increase capacity to 4 million barrels a day within three years, compared with pre-war capacity of 6 million barrels. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s current total refining capacity is 730,000 barrels per day.

 A burly bearded man uses sign language to communicate with his pal as they belly up to the bar in a beer advertisement. An ad for laundry detergent shows a man in a wheelchair sky-hooking a soap packet into the washing machine. An ad for a Southern bank shows a mother getting her children off to school and settling down to `` read'' her bank statement, written in braille. Advertisers have been making greater use of people with disabilities in mainstream commercials, designed to show the wide appeal of their products and services. Advocates for the more than 37 million `` physically challenged'' Americans have welcomed this increased visibility. But they say the disabled still are under-represented. `` Advertisers have been a bit timid,'' said <PERSON> Arney </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblat </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and an advocate of more disabled people in advertising. `` They always try to get sexy girls and project a mainstream idea of what everyone wants to look like using their product.'' But she said a growing awareness of the economic clout of the disabled and pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to forbid discrimination against the disabled are having an impact. She said the disabled have an estimated $ 40 billion a year in spending power, an appealing target for manufacturers who have shown keener interest in getting messages to narrowly defined audiences. `` Five years ago, you could n't name one company -LRB- using disabled people in commercials -RRB- but now there are 10 or more,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosenblat </PERSON> said. They include <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Athletes in wheelchairs have been popular, including a <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> commercial that featured racer <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchette </PERSON>. But advocates for the disabled say they are even more encouraged by ads that integrate average people with disabilities into real-life vignettes. <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON>, for instance, showed a blind man and his guide dog in a recent commercial for <LOCATION> Purina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chow </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> cast a businessman in a wheelchair with a briefcase on his lap in an ad that showed people hurrying to work; and a <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> ad included a boy in a wheelchair among a half-dozen youngsters trimming a Christmas tree. <ORGANIZATION> Levi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strauss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the apparel maker from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was among the first to integrate disabled people into general advertising. In 1984, <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> used a man in a wheelchair as one of several people shown in a commercial for <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s 501 blues, and has used a woman in a wheelchair, a hearing-impaired woman using sign language and an amputee on crutches. `` We have never used them deliberately except when it seemed appropriate for the situation,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, an executive at the Levi ad agency, <ORGANIZATION> Foote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Belding. Fast-food leader <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has made prominent use of the disabled. Its captioned `` Silent Persuasion'' ad a few years ago showed two deaf students using sign language on a study break. Another ad called `` Best Friends'' showed a typical day for two junior high girls, one in a wheelchair. `` Our view is that since a large percentage of our commercials deal with ` slice of life' situations, you do n't ignore people who are a large part of society,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebeling </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, Ill.-based company. In an ad for Budweiser that ended an 18-month run late last year, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> showed a dozen scenes of friends enjoying a beer _ a group of graduates in their gowns, some aging veterans at a reunion, a father and son on a porch. In one shot of a crowded bar, a bearded man can be seen using sign language as he talks with a pal standing beside him. `` Great catch!'' the admakers said the deaf man tells his friend as they watch television. `` Want another Bud?'' <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> admakers cast a man in a wheelchair for a Fab One Shot commercial that ran last year. The commercial showed people tossing the detergent packet into the washing machine from odd angles to the tune `` Sweet <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, vice president of creative services at <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION>, said she previously had received letters encouraging her to use the disabled in ads, and felt it would be appropriate for this commercial. The man selected for the ad played in a basketball league for the disabled, she said, and he provided `` something extra that happens from both a human and a selling point of view.'' <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, has been running ads for months that draw attention to its services. The bank has been printing bank statements in braille for blind customers since the 1970s but had not advertised it until earlier this year. The commercial shows a woman at her door as her children leave for school. She turns back into the house and takes some papers off a table. But it is only when she is seated and scanning the papers that viewers see they include a statement written in braille which the woman reads by passing her fingers over the raised dots. She is blind. Advocates for the disabled say they want to see more. Disabled people make up 15 percent of the population but far fewer in ads. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Slutsky </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Peoplefinders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> agency that specializes in finding non-professional talent for commercials, said none of the 50 or so advertisers she works for have asked for disabled people, although she expects that to change. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Saviola </PERSON>, director of casting services at <ORGANIZATION> Grey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said advertising agency people may simply not be `` sensitive enough to the whole situation'' to request disabled people for roles. Sometimes even when a disabled person is required for in a commercial, admakers can stumble. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Demby </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vet who lost both legs in the war and starred in a commercial that showed him playing basketball with artificial legs made by <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he almost backed out of the commercial. He said one person involved in making the ad indicated he would manipulate a camera to make it appear <PERSON> Demby </PERSON> could jump much higher than he actually could. In a telephone interview from his home near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Demby </PERSON> said the comment upset him because he did n't want to mislead anybody about what artificial legs could do for an amputee. `` But they assured me they would try to keep a reign on'' the offending admaker, <PERSON> Demby </PERSON> said, and he made the ad. He said he's happy with the result and thinks it reflects well on both the disabled and veterans. `` The only difference between disabled people and others are what we use as transportation,'' he said.

This week's light trading continued for a third day, with little outside news of any consequence affecting prices, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Lack of export demand and beneficial rains for both the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter crop was hurting wheat prices, Ms. <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON> said. Supporting futures prices was new Soviet interest in the agricultural markets, as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> purchased 50,000 metric tons of Argentine meal and 350,000 metric tons of corn from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> since Tuesday, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a floor trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. At the close, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents to 5 -RCB- cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.03 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher, with December at $ 2.42 -LCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 \ cents lower, with December at $ 1.45 -RCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher, with November at $ 5.66 -LCB- a

 The stock market was mixed today in an atmosphere of uncertainty after Tuesday's volatile session. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in early trading Tuesday, and then rebounded to recoup most of its loss. Analysts said that typified the recent volatile behavior that has put many investors on their guard. In addition, traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in advance of the government's report Thursday morning on the gross national product for the third quarter of the year. The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic growth, possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but also raising questions about the outlook for corporate profits.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday confronted 16 allies pressing to ease controls on sensitive high technology sales to Communist governments in light of rapid changes in the Soviet bloc. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged before the meeting that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was all but isolated by allies who want greater trade with fewer restrictions. At the same time, the source said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation feels that some countries, including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, have not strengthened export controls as promised. The meeting of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to end Thursday. Until then, not even its location was to be disclosed. <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>, comprised of the 15 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, regulates trade in items to Soviet bloc nations. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said three issues would dominate the agenda: streamlining the list of restricted items, improving export controls and discussing political developments in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>'s list of restricted items threatens to drive a wedge between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its European allies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials contend that, in a new atmosphere of openness, Soviet engineers are acquiring restricted Western technology at what may be an unprecedented rate. European governments insist the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is dragging its feet, reviewing the list item-by-item and retaining simple items that reached <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> long ago. They argue that changing philosophies in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> put political and economic pressure on them to expand trade. Increasingly, <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> partners accuse the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of using the list to stifle foreign competitors of American manufacturers. They say that some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are also guilty of infractions. Recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence findings report that more than 5,000 machine tools have been sold illegally to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over the past five years. The Kremlin depends on Western high-precision gear for manufacturing military equipment. Before the meeting Wednesday, <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> undersecretary of state for security assistance, visited <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to warn that <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> might be banned from selling some items in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Italian manufacturer was alleged to have exported to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> machine tools used for making fighter aircraft engines. <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> also was reported to have sent technicians to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In a well-publicized case last year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was accused of selling sophisticated equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in violation of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> regulations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claimed the equipment helped the Soviets build quieter, harder to detect submarines, and it slapped severe sanctions on <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> and prohibited it from exporting to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for three years. On Wednesday, another Japanese firm, <PERSON> Tomei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON>, was convicted of exporting electronic products to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in violation of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> rules. The trading firm and one if its employees were fined a total of $ 4,900. Two other employees were given six-month prison terms. Specialists say part of the problem is the political role of export industries in national economies. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials showed The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> an internal report identifying <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as `` the greatest single source of transfers of sensitive technology'' to the East. The report blamed pressure from <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> business on a government eager for links to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Even <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, regarded as a relatively effective <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> partner, has allowed serious leaks. Earlier this year, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials said they were investigating the apparent role of a government adviser in illegal sales to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of machine tools used in making warplanes.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to trim its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exploration and production business reflects an industry-wide trend toward bolstering their shrinking reserves by boosting overseas exploration, analysts said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement on Tuesday followed similar restructurings earlier this year by other major oil companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest oil company after <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in its third-quarter earnings report that it had taken a $ 40 million provision for the restructuring costs The oil giant said it planned to transfer and terminate employees over a two-year period `` to reduce costs and focus efforts in areas where the projected financial returns are most attractive.'' Details of the reorganization were not immediately available, but <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said an announcement was planned for Friday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> has been selling off a great number of small properties since the early 1980s,'' <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said. `` This -LRB- restructuring -RRB- is part of that.'' Analysts familiar with <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy said the announcement was not a surprise given the general industry trend to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drilling costs and focus exploration overseas, where the probability of finding large reserves is greater and financial exposure is lower due partly to more favorable tax and royalty rates. `` We're going to see more and more announcements by other majors,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ting </PERSON>, analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Low crude oil prices over the last few years and heavy exploration costs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have discouraged many companies from pumping more money into domestic oil drilling Crude prices have hovered in the $ 18 to $ 20 a barrel range in recent months, and as low as the $ 12 range last year. More importantly, analysts say, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil patch may be nearly bone dry, with little oil left outside of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and offshore <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The last major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil find was in the late 1960s in <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Industrywide, domestic production fell by more than 500,000 barrels a day during the first nine months of this year compared with a decline of about 200,000 barrels a day during 1988. `` Basically, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has been drilled over for oil. The large deposits are in geologically hostile areas or off limits due to environmental concerns,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehl </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Most oil companies, including large independents, are reshuffling assets abroad because of declining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> output, <PERSON> Kehl </PERSON> said. `` Areas outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> are considered a more cost-effective use of oil drilling funds,'' he said. In 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> announced a major restructuring of its upstream operations _ exploration and production _ as part of an industry-wide shakeout due to plummeting oil prices. Last March, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> announced the reorganization of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> upstream operations into two regions as part of an overall restructuring to increase the company's profits worldwide. The move included the streamlining of regional and divisional offices and trimming of management. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> followed with an announcement in late March that it was cutting its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exploration and production workforce by 800. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> said at the time that its domestic operations would continue to shrink through divestment of marginal and non-strategic properties while international activities would grow. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> continued the trend in recent weeks with the announcement that it had ceased all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exploration and was expanding its drilling overseas.

 Wall Street was stunned. Bond brokers froze. Doomsayers talked of financial disaster. That was the scene a year ago, as the biggest takeover battle of all time consumed <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. When it was over, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had defeated the food and tobacco giant's top management, paid a record $ 24.53 billion in borrowed money and put the company heavily into debt. Critics of the 1980s takeover era said <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> would be crushed by the weight of its debt load and jeopardize the banks that financed the deal. The bond market, already reeling from a rash of high-priced takeovers, was traumatized because investors thought the buyout binge had gone too far. What a difference a year makes. Despite a debt of $ 23 billion, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> now is seen as a relative rock of stability while the financial markets are buffeted with uncertainty raised by smaller takeovers. `` I think the company is doing tremendously well,'' said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Feuerman </PERSON>, a securities analayst at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said, `` It's a good company and they've got a good team. Investors also praise the new <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. Confidence in the company was evident in the recent performance of the company's high-yield `` junk bonds'' that were used to finance the takeover Prices skidded on the high-yieother big buyouts ran into trouble recently. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s did n't. There are two reasons why. Because of the nature of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s business, the company is considered inherently more stable than other companies. Investors also have confidence in its management. The biggest worry for highly leveragedld market after companies like <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> is cash flow _ without a strong, steady influx of money, they ca n't pay their interest bills. Several buyouts have stumbled because cash flow has n't matched projections. The most notorious case has been <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 6.6 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a wobbly transaction that jolted the stock and bond markets a few weeks ago because <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> could n't pay its interest. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, the acknowledged leader plan to shed any major divisions, <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> said in an interview. Individual product lines are the most likely to go. <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> said the Butterfingers and <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruth </ORGANIZATION> candy bar business is under consideration, but he declined to name any other possible candidates. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, the Wheat First analyst, said he was pleased by cost and inventory reductions and by the company's plans for boosting tobacco sales. In recent years, <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has turned around its once-lagging Camel brand, and is focusing on revitalizing <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> sales, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. The battle for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> marked a quantum leap in the scope of the takeover trend reshaping American business. For the first time, it seemed to raise the possibility that any company could be acquired with borrowed money. The company announced on Oct. 20 that its chief executive, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, was considering a bid of about $ 17 billion. That kind of money was beyond comprehension on Wall Street. But four days later, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 20.25 billion offer, signaling the start of a bidding war that for a while included the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> fight not only dwarfed all records for takeovers, it came against a background of brawls for two other big food companies. Just days before, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> had launched an $ 11 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had rejected a $ 5.23 billion bid from the British firm <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. In both cases the suitors won. And late in the evening of Nov. 29, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> had emerged the winner. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was vanquished but still rich from a severance package and the sale of his own <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> stock when he resigned in early February. He took several top <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> managers with him, but analysts said they were satisfied with <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>'s replacements. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> is also said to be happy with <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s performance The investment firm is smarting from <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON>'s problems and reports that it has been disappointed by other investments, and its reputation rests on the outcome of its biggest takeover. For <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>, the outside world's obsession with the size of the takeover is irrelevant. It's running the business that's most important. `` You've got to separate that financial transaction from the great marketing strength and production strength of this company,'' he said.

<HEAD>3rd-Qtr Earnings Rise 5.2 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its third-quarter profit rose 5.2 percent from a year ago on a revenue increase of 6.1 percent, but warned that price cutting could slow future earnings growth. The company, which is the world's largest brewer and also makes snack foods, said earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $ 238 million, or 83 cents per share, up from $ 226 million, or 78 cents per share, last year. Sales in the quarter rose to $ 2.70 billion from $ 2.55 billion in 1988. The company said it sold a record 21.4 million barrels of beer in the quarter, up 4.2 percent from a year ago. For the first nine months of the year, the company said its beer sales accounted for 41.9 percent of the industry's sales, up from 40.6 percent as year earlier. But August <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman and president, said <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> is being challenged by competitors who have begun to heavily discount their premium brands. `` We have been very reluctant to discount our high quality premium brands to the same extent as our competitors,'' <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> said. But he said some discounting is required to avoid further losses in sales volume. <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> said the financial impact of the price cuts will be lower earnings growth than anticipated for the last half of 1989 and the year 1990. But he said the move should eventually pay off in an even stronger market position and in higher earnings. For the first nine months, the company earned $ 639 million, or $ 2.23 per share, up 8.2 percent from $ 590.4 million, or $ 2.01 per share, a year earlier. Nine-month sales of $ 7.3 billion in the first three quarters of last year. The company recently agreed to purchase four Sea World Parks, two other theme parks and certain land near the parks from <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.1 billion. The deal is expected to be closed in November, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The dollar ended mostly lower Wednesday against major foreign currencies in thin, narrow trading following a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $ 369.10 a troy ounce, down $ 1.10 from Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 368.50 an ounce, off 20 cents. Currency dealers said the dollar got an early lift from comments from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> but edged lower mainly on technical factors. They said many dealers were awaiting Thursday's release of third-quarter gross national product data, which should shed more light on the direction of the economy and interest rates. In testimony before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> hinted that the central bank was unlikely to ease credit by lowering interest rates any time soon because the current inflation rate of 4.4 percent was too high to be ignored. Firm rates are seen as bullish for the dollar partly because they make dollar-denominated securities more attractive to foreigners, thereby increasing the need for those investors to convert their money into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell to 141.55 Japanese yen from 142.10 yen Tuesday. It traded at 141.60 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 141.57 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 141.50 Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 On a drizzly morning when traffic was snarled by an overturned nail truck, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> residents on Wednesday learned their fast-growing home had been named the nation's best place to live for the second time this year. The 1989 edition of the Places Rated Almanac picked <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> tops among 333 cities in terms of climate, transit, crime, education, health care, environment, jobs, arts and recreation. While <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> struggles with explosive growth, schools that do n't seem to live up to expectations and the pervasive problems of drugs and crime, attorney <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Pageler </PERSON> sees a special brand of optimism in the city. `` What I love about <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> is the optimism of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> people about our future,'' she said. `` There's that sort of progressive spirit of optimism. Perhaps it's what's left of the Western can-do spirit that's still here.'' Others who take a less spiritual view might cite <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainier </ORGANIZATION>'s glacial peak, the ferries plying Puget Sound, fresh salmon and Dungeness crabs stacked in the public market or ski slopes amid forests of Douglas fir Runner-up on the almanac's list was <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, followed by <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Maryland-Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Anaheim-Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The lowest ranking went to Pine Bluff, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> tried to put a better spin on the ratings. `` You could look at it as being the 333rd strongest city in the country,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` There are at least 4,000 to 5,000 other cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Joining Pine Bluff at the bottom of the list were, counting from 332nd up: <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; Casper, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, Money magazine also rated <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> the nation's most livable city. The announcement caused some <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> movers and shakers to note that while the city is a wonderful place to live its urban woes _ principally growth _ are mounting. Publicizing the city may only make problems worse, they say. `` <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> does have a lot of elements people seem to be paying attention to,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> and Planning at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` It may be lacking elements people are not paying attention to _ the ability of a city to deal with hard social problems.'' In the survey, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was rated tops in the nation for recreation, which comes as no surprise to the hundreds of thousands of residents who ski, hike, climb mountains, fish, hunt, sail, kayak or bicycle within minutes or, at most, a couple of hours of their homes. The city is home to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> and the nationally renowned <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> Cancer Research Center. It has more than half a dozen professional theaters staging plays. The local economy is diversifying, tourism and trade are up and the jobless rate was a relatively low 4.1 percent as of August. The <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> to the east and the Olympics to the west across the Puget Sound provide beautiful sunrises and sunsets, when the sun finds its way through the normally gray skies. Growth and popularity have n't changed <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s legendary damp climate, but longtime residents worry about what it's doing to a town they knew for its close neighborhoods and relaxed pace. Crime has grown, with an influx of drug-dealing gangs and the stigma of the nation's worst known serial murder case, the string of at least 41 slayings of young women attributed to the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Killer </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s schools have seen declining test scores, a flight of students to suburban and private schools, and an agonizing debate over revamping school busing for desegregation. A commute that used to take 20 minutes from the suburbs now takes an hour or more. Smog hovers over <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> and collects in the valleys south of the city, on some days veiling all but a yellowed outline of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, however, the semi-truck that dumped the nails on Interstate 5 north of the city was cleared before the commute was over, and the clammy weather gave way to crisp blues skies by noon.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> dedicated a $ 500 million computer chip laboratory Wednesday and said it would share its research on X-ray etching with another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chipmaker, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergevin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fishkill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was `` the nation's most advanced semiconductor development laboratory and on a par with any anywhere in the world. The upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> laboratory will eventually house the nation's first privately owned machine for etching computer chips with X-rays, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> scientists are already experimenting with X-ray etching at <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Upton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> will pay an undisclosed amount of money to send its engineers to <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> to participate in the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> research for 21 months.

<HEAD>Discounter Aims at Strong Retailing Role</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> decided to bring Zayre stores into the corporate fold, there were doubts that the discounter had selected an acquisition that would fit in easily or enhance its operations. A year later, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> is putting the finishing touches on what it calls the single largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail conversion ever. On Thursday, 254 former Zayre stores will open their doors under the Ames name. The 12-month process has turned <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> into a dominant discounter in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and the fourth-biggest discount retailer in the country with expected sales this year of $ 5 billion. The three leading discounters are <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Target </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> president and chief executive officer, said integrating <PERSON> Zayres </PERSON> has demonstrated Ames' ability to handle change, a necessary skill for mass merchants to have in a business where prosperity depends on being able to adapt to shifting consumer tastes and shopping habits `` Retailers who fail to change will fall by the wayside,'' <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> had considerable experience with acquisitions before it bought <ORGANIZATION> Zayre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s discount store division in October 1988 for $ 778 million. About 500 of Ames' 693 stores in 20 states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were the products of acquisitions; Ames has doubled its size twice in the past 4 years. `` We are a company that are accustomed to acquisition. And we are accustomed to change,'' said <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>. Retail analysts say Zayre posed a tough challenge for Ames. At the time <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> came on the scene, Zayre stores in some areas were suffering from a reputation for shoddy merchandise and poor service. Under <ORGANIZATION> Zayre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has restructured the retail operations it retained and changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> TJX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Zayre stores were n't making money Also, Zayre was technologically behind <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, lacking the advanced cash registers and other hardware needed to accomodate computerized inventory controls. Industry analysts say the use of sophisticated inventory management techniques _ employing state-of-the-art technology _ might be even more important for discounters than for regular retailers. Discounters must carefully monitor costs to maintain their slimmer profit margins. Ames went in and refurbished Zayre stores to give them a more customer-friendly layout and a better merchandise mix. Staff had the concept of customer service drilled into them. Technology was upgraded. Ames made a $ 30 million investment in cash registers and back-office equipment to speed customer check-out, streamline store data collection and provide the foundation for further improvements, such as bar-code scanning. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said the use of scanning had to be postponed within Ames for a year while the Zayre stores were being made compatible. It is being tested now and should be in place next year. As in Ames' original stores, the former Zayre stores are carrying more national brands in apparel, for instance. `` We have completely remerchandised everything carried in Zayres stores,'' said <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>. Retail analysts generally give Ames high marks for its long-term strategy but have taken a wait-and-see attitude about the near future. Ames lost $ 20.7 million, or 72 cents a share, in the first half of this year due to the costs of transforming Zayre and disappointing retail sales. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> has said the full year will turn out to be profitable. Retail analyst <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Turben </PERSON> said the `` acquisition of Zayre will test their ability for some time because it was a major acquisition.'' But she said it could pay off. `` The combination with Zayre is going to give <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> quite a lot of power,'' she said. `` The environment is competitive and will continue to get more competitive but good management can do well.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jicha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gundy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, thinks Ames can thrive under its current management. `` Ames prides itself on its management capability, I think justly so, `` said <PERSON> Jicha </PERSON>. Ames' performance in the fourth quarter, by far the most important time for retailers, will provide an indication if customers like what <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> has done. `` The proof of the whole pudding is going to come in the fourth quarter,'' said <PERSON> Jicha </PERSON>. He is recommending purchase of Ames stock based on a projected return to profitability this year and a sharp jump in earnings next year. In addition to the 254 renamed Zayre stores, <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> owns 61 others that are retaining the Zayre name. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said its research indicated that the markets in which the 61 operate _ mainly <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> _ had strong customer loyalty to the Zayre name.

 <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> is behind the wheel of his company car _ a late-model domestic station wagon _ snaking through a single lane of rain-soaked traffic slowed by construction. The contractor widening the roads outside <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> had promised to keep two lanes open. <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> picks up his car phone and orders a secretary to complain. `` You've got to stay on top of these contractors all the time,'' he says. <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON>'s conservative car and attention to detail reflect the attitude that has made this scrappy regional carrier survive the past decade, to become what the 56-year-old chairman and former fighter pilot calls `` an airline airline.'' Midway, the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline certified in the era of regulation and first new one to fly under deregulation, marks its 10th anniversary Wednesday. Although it has less than 1 percent of the national air-travel market, Midway's business is expanding quickly at a time when rivals are worried about keeping passengers. In November, the carrier is opening a second hub in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and offering first-class service. Midway also is unencumbered by the kind of takeover trauma preoccupying its larger <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> neighbor, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We realize that even though we're growing rapidly, we're smaller than most of the carriers _ but we're an airline airline,'' <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said in an interview An original investor in Midway, <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> sees the airline as a regional carrier providing many of the same services offered by larger competitors: flights to many cities, a frequent-flier program and international links. `` It's a nice little airline, no doubt about it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pincavage </PERSON>, a partner at The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based investment bank that specializes in airline securities. Midway has achieved that status through attention to customer service, a conservative balance sheet and avoiding direct competition with large airlines, <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said. Department of Transportation figures on domestic airlines for the first nine months of 1989 show Midway ranks among the top 10 for the fewest passenger complaints, at an average 1.46 per 100,000 passengers, and in honoring reservations, bumping an average 1.6 passengers per 10,000 boarded. Midway started as a cut-rate airline offering penny-a-mile fares in its first promotion on Nov. 1, 1979, when three DC-9s flew to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The carrier now serves 51 cites with a fleet of 64 planes from <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, 11 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Loop. That is about half the distance from downtown to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, Midway signed a $ 2 billion deal with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for 74 new jets and agreed to pay $ 244 million for 33 twin-engine turbo-prop commuters from a West German manufacturer. While its capacity has steadily increased, earnings have varied. Two years of modest profits followed a first-year loss. Midway then logged three losing years through 1985, when <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> became chairman and chief executive officer. The company since has since reported three consecutive profitable years, although earnings fell last year. One explanation for the slump was a drop in passenger traffic blamed on Midway's slow response to triple-mileage frequent flier incentives offered by other airlines `` We made a mistake,'' <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said. Midway earned $ 6.5 million, or 60 cents a share, on revenues of $ 412 million in 1988, vs. $ 18.6 million, or $ 1.70 a share, on revenues of $ 346.9 million in 1987. The airline earned $ 8 million, or 62 cents a share, on sales of $ 233 million for the first six months this year, vs. $ 4.3 million, or 27 cents a share, on $ 192 million in revenues for the year-earlier period. Analysts who follow airline stocks see Midway as a solid performer in a volatile industry. But the airline's $ 205.6 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> assets at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> could hurt Midway's financial performance in the next two years. <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> is counting on the airline's lock on <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to help pay the cost of developing the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> hub. `` We have this chasm to get across, but we can fund that out of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It would be a big mistake for us to go to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and try to be successful if we did n't have a pretty good airline here in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' In an increasingly competitive industry, <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldutis </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Midway has a strong future. `` They have a very important market niche in terms of the Midway Airport dominance that they have successfully developed,'' he said. `` I think more importantly, they have one of the strongest managements in the airline industry in terms of developing that niche, because it basically boils down to management.'' Midway's success has spawned persistent rumors of a takeover, but no deal has surfaced. Midway management treats the 9.6 percent stake purchased earlier this year by <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a `` normal business investment,'' said airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. But when its crosstown neighbor <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> was in the midst of takeover negotiations in August, Midway's board strengthened the company's `` poison-pill'' defense against hostile suitors `` I mean prudent boards do those things,'' <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said. `` But the board's instructions to me and my feeling as well is that we're going to operate Midway like any business `` If somebody insists on buying the company and they offer a price that's so high that the board feels they must accept it, then we'll sell the company, obviously.''

 A year after starting and losing the fight over <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has all but disappeared from public view. But he lacks neither money nor activity. In the aftermath of the $ 24.53 billion battle for the food and tobacco giant, the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> era is a memory at <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. Acquaintances and associates say it's also history to the man who a year ago was president and chief executive of the company. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, now owned by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has moved its headquarters from suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and is headed by former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>. The once flamboyant <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 57, meanwhile, is the low-key chairman of <ORGANIZATION> RJM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an Atlanta-based international management advisory company organized in February when <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. He took a fair amount of money with him when he left. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who earned a $ 1.8 million salary in his final year with <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, received $ 7.2 million in continued pay to see him through 1991, when he will be eligible for retirement benefits. His `` golden parachute'' included nearly $ 2 million to help <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> pay his taxes. He also received $ 19.2 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> would have been even wealthier had his bid for the company prevailed. He said during the height of the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> fight that, if successful, he could expect to make $ 100 million in seven or eight years. `` But making $ 100 million was not my motive by any stretch of the imagination,'' he said then. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was seen as pursuing a buyout purely for his own greed. He was criticized for his initial low $ 17 billion bid and his own built-in rewards in the offer. His plans to sell off all of the company's non-tobacco businesses and disregard of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> employees also rankled many people _ including the firm's board of directors _ and although his $ 25.2 billion final bid was higher than the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offer, it was n't enough to win. The record size of the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal also brought unprecedented public attention to the phenomenon of leveraged buyouts, takeovers largely accomplished through the use of borrowed funds. After <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>' victory in early December, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> issued a statement wishing the new owners good luck and maintaining that his initiation of the takeover process benefited the company's stockholders He has offered no further public post-mortems. `` I think he's put that in the past,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Liss </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> consultant who was a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Liss </PERSON> said he understood that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has discussed the takeover battle with several authors in an effort to ensure that books about the deal are accurate. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Koblentz </PERSON>, a partner at <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zehnder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> executive search firm that has dealt with several former <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> employees, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> sits on eight or nine corporate boards and also has been exploring various investment opportunities. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has stepped out of the public spotlight by his own choice, <PERSON> Koblentz </PERSON> said. `` He's picking and choosing his activities,'' <PERSON> Koblentz </PERSON> said. `` He has a number of interests, both social and business, and a number of homes.'' <PERSON> Koblentz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s low-key nature is quite in contrast to the style he practiced as <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s CEO. `` We have n't seen him on the restaurant and party circuit as much as he used to be,'' <PERSON> Koblentz </PERSON> said. `` He used to be very visible.''

<HEAD>LIN Says McCaw Will Have To Extend Partial Tender Offer for LIN Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will have to extend its $ 2.75 billion offer for about 40 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s shares. The <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> offer of $ 125 a share for 22 million of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s shares is currently scheduled to expire Friday, but <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> will have to extend it because <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> has failed to announced sufficient committed financing for the deal. <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> said federal securities regulations would require <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> to keep its offer open five days after announcing fully committed financing. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, the nation's largest cellular telephone company that has been pursuing <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> since June, said in a statement that it was `` moving forward with our financing beyond the initial round of commitments.'' The <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, Wash.-based <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said last week that it had received $ 1.2 billion in financing commitments from three banks that are highly confident they could arrange a syndicate of banks to commit the balance of the $ 4.5 billion in financing needed within a few weeks. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> wants to arrange financing for more than the costs of the tender offer alone because it intends to buy <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s half-interest in a cellular franchise in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for $ 1.9 billion as well `` The issue now at hand is will LIN conduct a fair auction,'' <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said in Wednesday's statement. New York-based LIN has taken no position on the <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> offer, and wo n't do so until it hears from <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the regional telephone company based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with whom it has a separate deal to merge cellular telephone operations. A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> said the company expects to respond to the <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> offer for LIN soon, but could not say when. In national over-the-counter trading Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> rose 50 cents a share to $ 109.25 while <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> rose 50 cents a share to $ 40.50.

<HEAD>Oil Futures End Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices ended mixed Wednesday with the crude oil market under pressure from growing concern about excess <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production. Analysts said the crude market largely ignored an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report that showed a decline in oil inventories last week. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, finished 10 cents lower at $ 19.62 a barrel. January crude ended down 3 cents at $ 19.52 a barrel while contracts for later delivery advanced. Refined products traded on the exchange also closed mixed. The November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.61 cent to 53.40 cents a gallon and later contracts also rose. November heating oil lost 0.1 cent to 58.44 cents a gallon and December declined 0.20 cent to 58.67 cents a gallon, while contracts for later delivery showed gains and losses. Analysts said API statistics released after the close of trading on Tuesday showed that inventories of crude and products declined in the week ended Oct. 20. Although the data should have been bullish, concern about rising oil production dampened the markets' enthusiasm, traders said `` The markets sagged as traders continued to express some concern over higher <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production as well as evidence of sluggish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, senior broker and analyst with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The API data showed that crude stocks fell 6.3 million barrels to 336.5 million barrels; total gasoline supplies were down 2.1 million barrels to 223.2 million; and heating oil declined 374,000 barrels to about 120 million barrels. Industry estimates suggest that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> is continuing to increase production. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> output recently swelled to more than 22 million barrels a day, well above its official quota of 20.5 million barrels a day. Various <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members also have suggested recently that the cartel will raise production further as worldwide demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil increases in coming years. Nevertheless, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand is expected to decline, putting downward pressure on oil prices.

<TEXT>
 A production-halting strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is only strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, union president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said Wednesday. Addressing reporters at the District Lodge 751 hall after two days of visiting picket lines in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> vowed the union would spare no effort or expense to win. `` I am here to tell you personally that the international union is totally committed to seeing this strike through to victory,'' <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said. In a room containing 20 eight-foot tables loaded with bread, canned goods and other food, plus a wall lined with food cartons five to six high, all donated, he cited similar support for striking <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> coal workers and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, a striker and union volunteer worker, said food donations amounted to $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 at the district lodge alone. `` I am certainly proud to be associated with the working people here at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> who are leading the fight for fairness and justice for working families here and throughout the land,'' <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said. The union represents 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers nationwide, including 43,300 in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, and a few hundred at scattered sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and other states. Union members voted 85 percent to strike rather than accept a three-year contract. The contract offers pay increases of 4 percent the first year, 3 percent the second and 3 percent the third; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to cover inflation; a 20 percent reduction in mandatory overtime; and higher benefits. Since the strike began Oct. 4, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has announced orders for 68 aircraft worth $ 4.3 billion and has delivered 11 planes, all of which were virtually complete before the walkout. The only talks during the strike collapsed after less than four hours Oct. 18, and no more meetings have been scheduled. Major issues are wages, mandatory overtime, pensions, health and welfare payments and standards for promotions. Distribution of strike pay of $ 100 a week per striker begins Thursday. The last paychecks for work done before the strike were issued last week. Neither <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> nor district lodge president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would predict how long the strike could last. <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said fewer than 1 percent of union-covered workers were crossing picket lines. With a strike fund of $ 95 million and 850,000 members paying into the fund weekly, strike pay of $ 100 a week could be maintained `` as long as it takes,'' he said.

 Soviet workers at six mines called strikes Wednesday in <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> coalfields that were hit by large-scale walkouts last summer, the region's strike leader said. About 5,000 miners had voted for walkouts by Wednesday evening and up to 20,000 at 12 mines were expected to strike, said <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopasov </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> area strike committee. The strike violated a law passed this month by the Soviet legislature setting arbitration procedures for would-be strikers and banning walkouts in such vital areas as energy, defense and transportation. First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> said this month that power stations and public utilities had 4.5 million fewer tons of coal on hand than at the same time last year due to the summer strikes. He said miners would have to work harder to avoid rationing of heat, light and electricity this winter. This summer, strikes in virtually all the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s major coalfields, from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in the south to the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> fields in the far north, paralyzed much of its coal industry. The miners, who demanded better working conditions and consumer supplies as well as more financial independence for their mines, went back to work after the government conceded to almost all their demands. But this week, miners in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> and in the western Siberian mining town of <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION> declared the government had failed to come through on some of the promised benefits. About 20,000 Mezhdurechensk miners staged a two-hour warning strike Monday despite officials' protests that they were showing disrespect for the new law. The <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> strikers demanded the government fulfill its promises of this summer and punish officials who had gone back on their word. They also wanted official status to be granted to new committees formed to defend workers' interests, <PERSON> Kopasov </PERSON> said. As he spoke Wednesday by telephone from <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>, word arrived at strike headquarters that the town's chief prosecutor had ordered officials at one of the striking mines to give him a list of the walkout's organizers, <PERSON> Kopasov </PERSON> said. He said that made the strike leaders expect a crackdown from local authorities. At a news conference Tuesday, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops that have been sent in to quell major unrest around the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in recent months said his soldiers would not be called on to repress any renewed strikes. `` That is a political-legal question. We handle only massive disorders,'' said Col.-Gen. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatalin </PERSON> This summer's coal strikes involved virtually no violence. Strikers policed their own ranks and the authorities generally refrained from intervening. But that was before the new law on strikes, when the strikers' legal status was unclear The government has not indicated what its response to such open defiance of the new law will be. There has been no report of reprisals against the <ORGANIZATION> Mezhdurechensk </ORGANIZATION> workers who struck Monday. <PERSON> Kopasov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> strikers also were demanding publication of an appeal to the country's workers that called for solidarity and condemned the new strike law. The law `` is aimed at depriving workers of the right to the extreme measure of striking, and at distancing the worker from the process of democratization,'' it said in part. The strikers also put forth several political demands, including that the country's legislature consider doing away with the article in the constitution that makes the Communist Party the `` leading and guiding force of Soviet society,'' <PERSON> Kopasov </PERSON> added.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A class action lawsuit was filed Wednesday on behalf of a group of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders alleging officials of the struggling real estate and retailing giant misled them about its ability to repay a huge debt. The lawsuit was brought in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court against the Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> and other top executives. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> owns a range of department stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is perhaps best known for its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, the swank <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> retailing chain. The company's $ 11.5 billion debt has injected uncertainty into the corporate bond market and raised the likelihood that <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>'s and other valuable <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> assets will have to be sold. The lawsuit seeks to determine whether the price of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock was artificially inflated by alleged misrepresentations about the company's financial situation A damage amount is n't specified. `` Although <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> incurred significant debt in connection with its massive acquisitions throughout 1988 and until mid-September 1989, it made positive statements regarding its financial condition and it repeatedly reassured the investing public that it would be able to repay its debt,'' the suit said. `` The motivation for this deceit was that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> needed additional financial capital from private and public sources,'' it said. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of all people who purchased <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> stock between April 1 and Sept. 19, when the company disclosed it reached an agreement with one of its major stockholders, <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, on a $ 250 million loan to help the company meet interest payments due on its bonds and help its stores pay for winter and spring merchandise. The lawsuit said news of the company's financial restructuring sent the price of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> stock tumbling and caused substantial losses to shareholders. The loan from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was be used to provide cash for <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s two retail units, <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Besides <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail operations include the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said last month that <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>'s probably would have to be sold as part of a restructuring to reduce the company's debt exposure. A Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Tokyu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a large Tokyo-based retailing chain, had offered $ 1.3 billion to buy <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the report in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>.

 Grand pianos and haute cuisine. Mahogany and gold. A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> company is bringing European-style luxury trains to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rails _ for a price. Refurbished Pullman cars will carry passengers coddled by an on-board staff between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, beginning Nov. 15. The cars will be pulled behind <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s regularly scheduled train over the route. A preview excursion between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is set to leave Friday with about 55 passengers for a one-time trip. <ORGANIZATION> American-European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> patterned the luxury service after the storied <ORGANIZATION> Orient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and its modern-day recreation. <PERSON> Edy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuger </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Nostalgie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Istanbul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zurich </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, which operates luxury trains in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, is a partner in the $ 15 million venture. Ten refurbished <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> cars dating to the 1930s have been given leather and mahagony interiors trimmed with brass and 24 karat gold. Two club cars feature grand pianos. Dining cars will serve seven-course meals on fine china. Passengers will have access to a fax machine and telephone along the <LOCATION> Chicago-Washington </LOCATION> route that was picked in part for its scenery, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Spann </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> company. No single seats will be available _ only sleeping compartments. `` Businessmen holding meetings, newlyweds, people having affairs'' are some of the intended passengers, <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> said. The luxury cars will be hitched to regular <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> trains. One-way fares for the cabins along the <LOCATION> Chicago-Washington </LOCATION> route will range from $ 695 for a single to $ 1,450 for the biggest cabin, called the `` Presidential.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> charges $ 103 to $ 356 one way between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, depending on whether the passenger is traveling in coach or a sleeping car. Travelers on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> City-Atlanta preview will pay $ 425 a person. It cost the company $ 1 million each to refurbish the Pullman cars. All but one are completed. <PERSON> Spann </PERSON>, also president of <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said the service is the result of a chance encounter he had with <PERSON> Zuger </PERSON> three years ago. <PERSON> Zuger </PERSON> had been looking for an American partner to set up a luxury train operation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. While vacationing at <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, he mentioned his plan to <PERSON> Spann </PERSON>, who said he would be interested. <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> said he lined up investors to go into partnership with <PERSON> Zuger </PERSON>'s company, obtained the cars and made a deal to pay <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> up to $ 5.6 million a year to pull them behind its regular Capitol Limited.

<HEAD>Delta's Profit Up 33 Percent in Quarter; America West Up 30 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported a 33 percent increase in quarterly net income to a record $ 133.1 million, attributing the jump in part to the continuing strike against rival <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said its earnings increased nearly 30 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in fiscal 1988. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest airline, said its earnings per share were $ 2.53 for the quarter ending Sept. 30, compared with net income of $ 100 million, or $ 2.03 a share, a year earlier. The period is the first quarter of the airline's fiscal year. First-quarter revenue rose to $ 2.2 billion from $ 1.8 billion in the same quarter of 1988. Net income for the nine months ending Sept. 30 was $ 408.9 million, or $ 8.11 a share, up 58 percent from the same period in 1988.

<HEAD>Thrift Known for Junk Bond Investments Takes Huge Loss</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it lost $ 226.3 million in the third quarter because it was forced by new laws to record $ 357.5 million in losses related to its huge junk bond holdings. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the biggest junk bond investor among the nation's thrifts, earned $ 16.3 million in the same period last year For the three months ended Sept. 30, losses amounted to $ 11.57 per share, compared with earnings of 37 cents per share in the same quarter in 1988. Under the leadership of Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, a close friend of junk bond wizard <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> for years angered federal thrift regulators by amassing a huge portfolio of the high-yield, high-risk securities. Unlike some thrifts, however, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and 1987 made big profits on the investments, which now constitute about 30 percent of its $ 12.7 billion in total assets. On Wednesday, the thrift reported an accounting loss of $ 130.2 million resulting from the savings and loan bailout bill signed in August by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, which requires thrifts to get rid of all their junk bond investments by 1994. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said it also added $ 227.3 million to its reserves for losses on its junk-bond portfolio, bringing those reserves to $ 300 million, or about 6.7 percent of its total investment in the securities. The market for high-yield, high-risk securities has weakened severely in recent months, and the accounting loss of $ 130.2 million could be revised for the better if it improves, the company said. In the future, thrifts will have to invest in such bonds through separately capitalized affiliates rather than using government-insured deposits. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said that as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> refocuses on its lending business, `` we remain one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry.'' Under the bailout bill, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls were required to have tangible capital _ the excess of real assets over liabilities _ immediately and reach 3 percent tangible capital by the end of 1994. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> had tangible capital of 6 percent before Wednesday's writeoffs After taking them it has 3.6 percent, spokeswoman <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported a third-quarter loss of $ 24.1 million, a good part of it stemming from the computer business the company is selling. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said its consumer electronics operations, which also posted losses, were affected by a variety of factors. The company said it reduced distributor inventory levels of color television sets, which undercut sales. It said it also shared in the industrywide softness in the sales of video cassette recorders. The quarterly loss of $ 24.1 million, or 90 cents a share, compares with a $ 3 million profit, or 11 cents a share, during the same quarter a year ago. Higher prices per unit helped sales increase to $ 376.8 million from $ 360.7 million. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this month it is selling its computer business to <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, subject to stockholder approval. It said the third-quarter loss from this operation was $ 15 million, compared with a profit of $ 1 million during the 1988 period. Its quarterly loss from continuing operations _ its remaining operations minus the computer business _ was $ 9.1 million, or 34 cents a share. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 41.1 million, or $ 1.54 a share, compared with a $ 8.7 million loss, or 34 cents a share, during the year-ago nine-month period. Sales improved to $ 1.11 billion from $ 961.2 million. `` Full-year 1989 consumer electronics operating profits are expected to be better than last year's, but not as much as the $ 15 million improvement we forecast earlier,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON>, chairman and president.

<HEAD>SCI Television Proposes Exchange Offer for Bondholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held TV station company struggling to meet payments on its $ 1.3 billion debt, said Wednesday it was proposing a sweeping capital restructuring plan. The plan includes an offer to exchange about $ 665 million in public and privately held bonds for a combination of stock and new debt, and a deferment of a $ 153 million scheduled repayment of principal due last month on $ 650 million in bank loans. SCI, which owns six television stations, said the `` overall objective'' of its plan to realign its capital structure was to reduce scheduled debt service requirements by an unspecified amount. In addition, it said the plan would give the company a chance `` to implement an orderly asset sales program.'' A call was placed to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm said to represent bondholders, but it was not returned. <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, which was once part of the cable and TV company <ORGANIZATION> Storer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, was created in 1987 when it was acquired in a leveraged buyout. The company is 45 percent owned by the former shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had been organized in 1985 by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to buy the stations from <PERSON> Storer </PERSON>, and 55 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gillett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based entrepreneur <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillett </PERSON>. If bondholders and bankers accepted the plan, it would result in current bondholders owning about 30 percent of the equity in the company, <PERSON> Gillett </PERSON> with 41 percent, banks with 5 percent, the former <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> shareholders with 15 percent and 9 percent to be apportioned. <PERSON> Gillett </PERSON> would continue to manage the stations. The exchange offer is scheduled to expire at midnight Nov. 22. <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> said it must be tendered at least 90 percent of principal amount of each series of previously issued securities under the exchange offer for it to be obligated to make the exchange. The company said that in the event that the restructuring is not completed, there `` can be no assurance that the company will not elect to file for protection under applicable bankruptcy laws.''

 An investment group and the largest unsecured creditor of <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday they have agreed to co-sponsor a plan to buy the company's steel operations and bring the company out of bankruptcy proceedings. The investment group, including <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harlan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and two former <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> executives, proposes to acquire <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s steel operations by paying cash and assuming liabilities in a deal valued at more than $ 300 million Quantum Fund, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s largest creditor with claims exceeding $ 100 million on the company's bonds, would purchase up to $ 50 million in equity in the new company. `` We're hoping and offering that other creditors join with us in that infusion,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wechsler </PERSON>, financial adviser to Quantum, an investment fund, and co-chairman of the committee of unsecured creditors. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s profitable non-steel businesses, <ORGANIZATION> Mueller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and coal, copper and gold properties, would be shifted to a new company that would be owned by creditors. The plan, to be filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> within 60 days, is contingent on financing. <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> filed for reorganization under Chapter ll of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy code on April 17, 1987, listing debts of $ 740 million. The company employs about 2,400 workers producing a variety of carbon and specialty steel products. Despite the reorganization, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> has had to depend on its non-steel operations to turn a profit. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieckman </PERSON>, former chief operating officer of <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harlan </ORGANIZATION> group, said another major creditor, <ORGANIZATION> AFC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has approved the plan. Quantum and AFC together control about 40 percent of <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s debt to bondholders, he said. The bank group also includes former <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sieckman </PERSON> said the bidders assume there will be a mild recession in the steel industry continuing through 1990. The company would need about $ 100 million in capital improvements. He said he saw no reason to streamline <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s varied lines of carbon and specialty steel products. `` We would like to make it bigger, more viable,'' he said. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing unsecured creditors, said the proposal dispels pessimistic predictions by <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating officer, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Sieckman </PERSON>. `` If you'd read some of his comments, you'd think there was no one in the western world that would be interested in buying <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> is losing money on its steel operations and that unless production costs are reduced it might not survive without continued support from its profitable non-steel operations. <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> Local 1197 President <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> were not available for comment, their secretaries said Wednesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had stopped doing business with four Wall Street firms involved in computerized program trading, saying the strategy had scared away investors by increasing stock market volatility. The Chicago-based money manager cited what it called the `` disruptive and destabilizing influence'' of the trading strategy, which some blame for worsening the 1987 crash and the recent Friday the 13th plunge. <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION>, which has about $ 7.5 billion in its stock portfolio out of $ 57 billion in total assets under management, said it had ended equity business with four firms that conduct program trading for their own accounts. It did not identify the firms. The practice of trading millions of shares of stock in seconds via computerized buy and sell programs _ which are used mainly by huge institutional investors _ has been accused of heightening stock market price swings. That volatility is seen as frightening individual investors out of the market. After the 1987 crash, most major brokerages curtailed program trading for their own accounts _ so-called proprietary trading _ but use of the strategy recently has increased. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said program trading accounted for 13.8 percent of its average daily volume in September, up from 10.3 percent in August and the highest percentage since the exchange began the calculation in July 1988. Some experts recently cited program trading as a factor when the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted more than 190 points in the final hours of trading on Oct. 13 and 85 points this past Monday morning. `` We believe that in the present environment, index arbitrage generally increases intraday market price volatility, which undermines investors' confidence in the fair functioning of markets,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Timbers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION>'s chief investment officer. `` We hope that this practice stops and prefer to conduct our business with brokerage firms who do not engage in this trading strategy,'' he said. Index arbitrage is a form of program trading that employs computers to rapidly buy and sell huge blocks of stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in an attempt to profit from minute differences in prices on the two markets. In September, <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conducted the most program trading of Wall Street firms, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said they were not among the four cut off by <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> and Bear, <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, another major program-trading firm, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION>, which resumed program trading in February, said the firm does business with <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> but had not yet been informed whether it was one of the four. `` We believe that our position is reasonable,'' said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named. `` During periods of market stress we will suspend proprietary arbitrage trading to avoid contributing to intraday volatility.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement was praised by several other money managers, who said they also would consider discontinuing placing stock orders with brokerages that engage in program trading for their own accounts. `` I think those guys are terrific,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cramer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We did n't have this horrible kind of volatility when these firms were refraining from it,'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. `` Now that they're back we have the volatility. `` Nobody needs that kind of volatility when there's nothing different in the companies' outlook,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreman </PERSON>, a managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Dreman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which has $ 4 billion in assets, about 85 percent in stocks. `` These methods work absolutely independent of the fundamentals in the economy and the stock market.'' <PERSON> Dreman </PERSON> said a boycott of firms that conduct index arbitrage would be `` very effective'' and said his firm would consider one if clients agreed to it. Defenders said program trading has been made a scapegoat for often-normal market fluctuations. They blame market volatility not on progam trading but on an overdependence on intermediate dealers whose job is to bring together buyers and sellers. `` It's a shoot-the-messenger issue,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wunsch </PERSON>, vice president for financial futures at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>. `` Arbitragers do bring selling pressure from one market to another market. But the selling pressure came first. They did n't cause it.''

<HEAD>Cineplex Odeon Founder Plans Bid for Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The feisty founder of <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Odeon </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s second-biggest theater chain, plans to make a multi-million-dollar bid to reclaim his company, <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Drabinsky </PERSON>, in concert with longtime partner <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, is putting together a deal already accepted in principle by the company's two biggest shareholders, who together own a majority of the stock. The proposal is worth 16.40 Canadian dollars a share, or about 781 million Canadian dollars for the 47.6 million shares outstanding. However, <PERSON> Drabinsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> already control between 7 percent and 8 percent of the stock and could join another shareholder to make the bid, lowering their financing hurdle. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> said financing is still being arranged and that the bid may not proceed. Under an agreement, the pair must make a formal offer by Nov. 22. <PERSON> Drabinsky </PERSON>, who turns 41 on Friday, began his career as a lawyer specializing in entertainment law. He founded the company a decade ago in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> by building a pioneering multi-screen movie theater. <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> now owns 1,870 screens at 500 locations, all but one of them in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It's the biggest chain in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, with 560 screens. The company is saddled with about 750 million Canadian dollars in long-term debt, making the buyout package worth more than 1.4 billion Canadian dollars. `` We thought it was an appropriate and fair bid,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolber </PERSON>, a member of a special committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> board examining offers, from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The committee was formed following an abortive attempt by <PERSON> Drabinsky </PERSON> in May to seize control by buying out the second-biggest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION> Claridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by Montreal-based businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>. That move enraged <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> entertainment giant which owns the biggest block of <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> stock _ 23.6 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> succeeded in getting Canadian regulators to stay <PERSON> Drabinsky </PERSON>'s hand by insisting he make the same $ 17.50-a-share offer to all shareholders. The <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> board then created the special committee to seek buyout offers for the entire company. Wednesday's announcement _ with details of a bid in the works _ caps weeks of speculation, although it left unanswered the big questions of financing and whether there are other serious bidders. Neither <PERSON> Drabinsky </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> responded to requests Wednesday for comment.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Announces $9 Million Tax Settlement with Mercedes-Benz</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has paid $ 9.1 million in corporate taxes on its <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> earnings, settling a case Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said will be a landmark for other states. The settlement ended a nearly 5-year fight between the state and the <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, N.J.-based company that had argued it did not owe the state a dime and had failed to contest a lawsuit in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> courts seeking the payment. The state won a default judgment against the company in May in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and seized a company-owned car from a Mercedes executive this summer. The $ 74,000 car was auctioned by the state and sold for $ 50,000, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said the settlement was the single largest tax judgment in state history and came about when he took steps to seize <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> property of Mercedes. `` We're going to make sure the big guys pay their fair share of taxes, not just the working men and women of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. `` I hope it is a clear and concise message to all taxpayers, especially corporate taxpayers, that it's not just the little guys who pay taxes,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has made collection of delinquent taxes a priority in his administration. `` <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> is pleased that its tax dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has been resolved in an equitable manner through good-faith negotiations initiated by <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Neary </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>. Revenue Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> said the case began in 1985 when his department investigated six foreign car companies. He said five were cooperative and paid $ 10 million in taxes, but <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> declined until last month. `` Since then, they have been completely cooperative. We are delighted they have seen the light,'' <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> had argued it did not owe <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> any taxes since it had no property in the state and since the imported German cars were sold directly to dealers as they left ships in states other than <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said the company had employees based in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to handle warranty matters, state Lemon Law issues and to work with dealers. In order to have to pay corporate taxes in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a company must have some form of connection to the state, what tax officials call a `` nexus.'' <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> said in most cases, it is clear whether or not a company must pay. A chain of retail stores with headquarters in another state owes <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> corporate taxes on its income from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> said, while a company that does strictly mail-order business from another state does not. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> said Wednesday's settlement covers Mercedes taxes from 1966, the year the state adopted a corporate excise tax, through 1985, the period covered by the lawsuit. Mercedes intends to file tax returns for the remaining years, he said. `` It was a total victory,'' <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> said.

The Houston-based company's net income totaled $ 87 million, or $ 2.02 per share, on sales of $ 683 million, compared with earnings of $ 58 million, or $ 1.40 per share, on sales of $ 502 million in last year's third quarter. `` In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> market share is at an all-time high,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer.

 Investigators searching for the cause of a huge plastics plant explosion discovered three more bodies in the twisted rubble Wednesday and continued the search for 17 others presumed killed. In all, five bodies have been found since a series of explosions ripped through the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant on Monday. Company officials learned that one man who had been listed as missing was not at the plant at the time, plant manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benz </PERSON> said. Assistant Secretary of Labor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, toured the plant Wednesday with other federal investigators sent in by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` It's total devastation,'' <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON> said. `` In 30 years of experience in the chemical industry, I've never seen such massive equipment twisted and strung about. `` It's still a very hazardous situation with twisted steel and columns, the total destruction of some parts _ you can only imagine the force of the explosion. Bolts were sheared right off and twisted like pretzels.'' The plant, which produced 4.5 million pounds of plastics a day, exploded in a series of blasts Monday afternoon, throwing metal and concrete debris as far as six miles. Miles of twisted strings of pipe are piled haphazardly around the plant. Some buildings are gone and eight giant chemical reactors vessels look like huge, battered tin cans. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> had a team of 15 investigators, including chemical and structural engineers, at the site. <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON> said they will help with recovery operations and offer technical assistance and advice. `` And then we want to determine a cause,'' <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON> said. `` We want to come up with prevention efforts to keep this from occurring again. `` Virtually every piece of material is being looked at as a piece of the puzzle,'' <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON> said, adding the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> crew expects to remain at the site for several days. `` We'll be here as long as it takes.'' The area where authorities believe most of the 18 missing workers are is a twisted jumble of rubble and debris. <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON> said the recovery of victims `` could be days, could be weeks. It's very complicated.'' Part of the problem is that when one piece of wreckage is moved, it sets off a chain reaction of falling debris, <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, the body of one of three contract workers unaccounted for since the explosions was found in a maintenance area in the morning. The two other bodies were found separately later in the day, but both were in the same vicinity near a storage area for poly-ethylene pellets, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicker </PERSON>, another company spokesman. Two other bodies were located earlier in the week. The identities of the dead have not been released. Officials do n't know yet exactly what caused the explosions. Flammable ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical reactor, but <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> officials said they do n't know how the gases were ignited. The plant manager repeated previous comments that the plant had an excellent safety record that included a 5 million-man-hour stretch with no safety-related work injuries that cost an employee work time. That would cover a period of some 2 -LCB- years, <PERSON> Benz </PERSON> said. But union officials say they are questioning work schedules that may have left less experienced or tired employees on the job. `` Our members tell us of long hours, cutbacks on staff and the utilization of subcontractors within the plant,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wages </PERSON>, national vice president of the Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. `` We'd like to know if these were contributing factors to the accident.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the company likely will rebuild at the site, but he was uncertain what type of facility would replace the plastics plant. The plant's 900 workers will continue to be paid for at least two months, he said, but some may be laid off later. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> will try to find work for some of them at the company's other operations in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweeny </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Investors Group Offers $205 Million for Arby's Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment group on Wednesday offered to buy Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 205 million, despite assertions by <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company that the fast-food chain is not for sale. The offer came from <ORGANIZATION> Stevric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, an investment group headed by brothers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, two former officers of the <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Famous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> hot dog chain. <PERSON> Stevric </PERSON>'s offer is the second bid for <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s since August. The earlier offer of more than $ 200 million came from R.B. <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a group formed by eight large <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s franchisees, part of a larger group known as A.P. <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to force financier <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to sell the company. But <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a publicly traded company controlled by <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> that owns <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, stressed again Wednesday that <PERSON> Arby </PERSON>'s is not for sale. An Arby's franchisee in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smaltz </PERSON>, who is part of R.B. Partners, said the group might find a deal with Stevric acceptable. `` If these people would be successful in buying <PERSON> Arby </PERSON>'s from <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, that could be a step in the right direction,'' <PERSON> Smaltz </PERSON> said. The franchisee group has raised more than $ 1 million to fund its efforts and is led by ousted <PERSON> Arby </PERSON>'s president <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Granada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is waging a hostile, $ 572 million fight for <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to take over all of <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> and has filed a federal lawsuit against the company, based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in the hopes of having a trustee appointed to consider its offer.
