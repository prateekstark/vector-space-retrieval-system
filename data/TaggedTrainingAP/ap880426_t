 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> certified his status as the Democratic presidential front-runner on Tuesday with a thumping 2-1 triumph over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won a resounding <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> victory and predicted the state would deliver the final delegates needed to clinch the nomination. By their victories, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emerged as almost certain opponents in the fall general election campaign _ survivors of a campaign marathon that once featured seven Democratic candidates and six Republicans. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was gaining 65 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and said his victory would be `` very very helpful'' in his quest for the White House. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was gaining 30 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vote, and said he intended to compete through the last primary on June 7. `` I'm a long-distance runner,'' he said. `` It's too close now to turn around.'' Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned across <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> during the day, declaring, `` We're almost getting down to the main event. According to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, this evening I'll capture enough delegates in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary to exceed the 1,139 -LRB- Republican -RRB- convention delegates needed for the nomination.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was gaining 79 percent of the vote to 12 percent for dropout Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and 9 percent for former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed to drop his studied show of neutrality and bestow his blessings on his vice president in a White House meeting on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegate count was far slower than the popular vote. He needed to win 58 of the 78 delegates at stake to clinch his majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count, and he seemed certain to get them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won all of the first 14 tallied, with the rest of the races still being counted. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won a separate landslide in election of delegates, leading for 165 to 12 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. One was uncommitted. That would bring <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' national delegate total to 1,266, compared to 850 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It takes 2,081 to clinch nomination. Network polling place interviews contained news that was as good for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as his vote totals. Though <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gained more than 90 percent support from blacks, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polling analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said that for the first time in the campaign season, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was winning a majority of voters who cited the poor and elderly as their chief concerns _ voters <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won in prior contests. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was winning voters who cited strong leadership and ability to make a change, groups that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> usually won in earlier races. `` He's emerging as the consensus candidate,'' pollster I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The next step is going to be binding the wounds, pulling the party together and getting it directed against the Republicans.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was cautious, as ever. Asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to claim the crown yet, refering to Democratic nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s problems in 1984. `` I reminded you several time that <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and then lost a string of primaries,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> achieved his status as odds-on favorite to win the nomination far faster than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, routing the Republican eld on a single Super Tuesday on March 8. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gained the upper hand week by week. Even so, both men fared better than seemed possible when the nominating wars opened in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last February _ and both men wound up third in the state's lead-off caucuses. On Tuesday, both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> already were pointing their campaigns toward the fall. With 73 percent of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> vote in, the Democratic vote was: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 745,930, or 65 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 344,284, 30 percent. On the Republican side, it was: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 447,504, 79 percent. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 68,402, 12 percent. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 53,166, 9 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> victory was a `` very big boost ... particularly in a state that has been a bellwether state in the general election.'' He said he would `` campaign as hard as I can'' in the remaining primaries. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made clear he has the same intentions. `` The contest will be determined on June 7 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>,'' he said from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which holds one of three primaries on next week's calendar `` We have every reason to be hopeful, if we keep winning every urban center. Our coalition is broad, it is strong, it is deep, and we're inspired to run on.'' The outline of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was taking shape. The vice president said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner lacks foreign policy experience and added, `` That will be a major issue in the fall.'' The vice president also arranged to meet Wednesday with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` will see him first thing in the morning, and I am sure the president will offer his congratulations and discuss how he can help in the campaign.'' On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was scarcely more than halfway toward a nominating majority, but party officials were beginning to talk aloud about a first-ballot victory for the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larryann </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, an uncommitted superdelegate from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said, `` If the voting goes the way it's going -LRB- in upcoming primaries -RRB-, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will get it -LRB- the nomination -RRB- on the first ballot.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman, agreed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enters his state with campaign momentum. `` What I worry about is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insiders trying to end the race before it's over,'' he said. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> had this advice for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` hang in there.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forged his early <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lead after a week-long campaign that looked and sounded more like a mutual admiration society than the typical 1988 Democratic primary brawl. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had scant hopes for a victory in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where his campaign failed to file a complete slate of delegate candidates. He already was looking ahead to next week's primaries in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 A government review panel has cleared a married couple at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> of violating federal travel rules or taking unauthorized trips at government expense, according to a published report Wednesday.

The panel said in a written report that Mrs. <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON> apparently had arranged three legitimate business trips so that she could be near her husband at the resort area of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and over Thanksgiving near his family's home in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciso </LOCATION> area. The board said arranging the trips for `` the personal convenience of the Hinches'' raised an `` appearance of impropriety,'' and noted that it had sought and received voluntary reimbursement of $ 3,264 for some costs related to the trips. However, the report added, `` The board does not believe that any disciplinary action is warranted by the evidence relating to the official travel by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paget </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON>.''

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> held a rare news conference to talk of his health and his fabled past as the world's longest-reigning monarch The annual news conference, to be broadcast Friday on his 87th birthday, came as some Japanese already were preparing for the death of the emperor, who has been on the throne since Dec. 25, 1926. Medical equipment has been moved from a hospital on palace grounds into <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s living quarters so he can die at home, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 From 1975 to this March, 226,091 Vietnamese boat people have landed in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, an official said today.

 <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaar </PERSON> always liked fixing things. He spent the last afternoon of his life laying new tiles on the family porch and wiring new lights. He planned to finish the job the next day, after a morning of throwing stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. But a soldier thought he saw a firebomb in <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>'s hand, and the next time <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> crossed the porch he was carried, with a bullet hole in his head. On an afternoon two weeks later, members of the family sat at home sipping strong Arab coffee and talking about the shy, 23-year-old electrician, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s first martyr of the Arab rebellion that began nearly five months ago in the Israeli-occupied lands. `` This uprising changes everyone,'' said <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>. `` It turns a sane man into a crazy man. It turns a shy man into an angry man.'' The clearest evidence of the change in <LOCATION> Salim </LOCATION> is in his diary, a frayed notepad from a souvenir shop lovingly preserved by his family. It speaks of his growing desperation. `` I do n't dream about toys anymore, mother,'' <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> wrote in an entry directed to his mother, <PERSON> Fatmah </PERSON>, several weeks before his death. `` When they killed my friends I grew up a thousand years.'' When the violence began Dec. 8, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> was a good-natured young man devoted to his job, who often stopped at the homes of neighbors after work to see if anything needed fixing, his family says. `` People appreciated him, and his work made him happy,'' said his brother <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, 21. `` He did n't have any great ambitions.'' <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> was happy at his family's home, and had added a room to it where he could settle one day with a wife. He filled the new closets with books on electricity, and moved into the room only weeks before he died. His possessions do not seem those of a man driven to die for a cause. They reveal instead a young man who liked music _ Turkish singers and traditional Arab tunes _ and was an amateur photographer who filling albums with pictures of his friends. Friends and family said <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> began to change when the `` intefadah,'' Arabic for uprising, came to the towns and refugee camps near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, taking the lives of young Palestinians like himself. `` <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> was affected by what was going on,'' said a cousin, <PERSON> Mussa </PERSON>. `` He had many friends who went to prison and it became obvious to him that one day he, too, would go to jail. So he wanted to prepare himself.'' He began spending free time at the nearby Dheishe refugee camp, talking to Palestinians who had been in jail and visiting the families of prisoners to offer emotional support. In the diary, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> sounds alternately desperate and defiant. `` What's a human being worth without a homeland, without a flag, without an address?'' he wrote, and later: `` The enemy planes can raid our camps and kill our children, but can not kill our will to fight.'' The entry for Friday, April 1, the night before his death, was the most striking: `` If my friends come back without me, mother, do n't cry. Every tear in your eyes is oil to light a lamp of freedom.'' <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> was in a good mood that Saturday morning, his family said. He took a shower, donned khaki trousers and a sweater, kissed his mother and said: `` If I come back, I wo n't be late.'' He and his brother, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, set off to join friends in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s market, gathering stones along the way. They became part of a group in central <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where Israeli soldiers were stationed. `` When it's over, you go back home. I'll go to a friend's house,'' <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, anticipating the house-to-house search that often followed protests According to the army account of the morning's events, a soldier thought he saw a firebomb in <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>'s hand, but the family called that `` absurd.'' What no-one disputes is that <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> was killed instantly by a bullet that went through his right cheek and out the back of his neck. His parents, still in mourning clothes two weeks later, became defiant in their grief when asked if they would stop their seven other children from joining protests. `` We all have the right to demonstrate for what we believe in,'' <PERSON> Fatmah </PERSON> said. `` I will never take that from my children.'' <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> nodded and added: `` Besides, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> is not really dead. He lives on as a hero for our town.''

 Commander <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON> and his band of Nicaraguan rebels move freely around what they call their `` liberated zone'' in the jungles near the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast. They are willing to talk peace but wo n't lay down their arms. `` We have received orders from our high command to stop shooting,'' <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON> said as he sat under a tree while his men rested nearby. `` But we are not dropping our guard. The enemy can not be trusted.'' A peasant widow provided food and coffee to his company of young rebels, including several women. <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON>, a former Sandinista who fought against the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> of late strongman President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, and his troops are in the jungles of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> province near the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast. They are part of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicarguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FDN </ORGANIZATION>, the main Contra force which has fought to overthrow the Sandinista government. The area is one of seven set up under a 60-day cease-fire agreement between the U.S.-backed Contras and the Sandinista. Under the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have promised not to attack Contra troops congregating in the areas. `` They do n't come here anyway,'' <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON> said. `` We liberated this zone a long time ago.'' Looking around at his troops, <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON> said, `` There is no one here among us against his will.'' `` The people know we are not mercenaries,'' he said. Journalists traveled with the group for a day, visiting different camps where they met groups of rebels. <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON> said he commands three companies of 100 men each in the rugged eastern zone. Sandinista army troops evacuated many of the residents from the mountainous region two years ago in an effort to remove the rebels' `` social base'' but some people refused to leave They often help the Contras and provide food. They do the same for the Sandinista army when it moves in. Some cattle still roam the area and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> groups use abandoned farms. <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON> and his men appeared to be well-armed and in good spirits. They had enough medicine and beef and plenty of U.S.-made candy to eat. At night they danced to tapes of Mexican `` ranchera'' music, then slept in hammocks made of silky parachute cloth. The commander said the last air drop of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies to the group came a month ago. Under the cease-fire that took effect April 1, rebels may receive humanitarian aid through neutral international organizations once they are settled in the designated zones. Details of the truce are still being worked out in talks which will resume Thursday. <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON> said he had received two letters from the regional commander of the Sandinista army asking him to meet with the government represntatives `` in an effort to achieve peace.'' He said he was waiting for further instructions from Contra headquarters. There have already been several meetings of army and rebel groups on the field since the cease-fire went into effect. `` We will do whatever our leaders tell us,'' <PERSON> Halcon </PERSON> said. `` If we had a complete cease-fire, it would be the most beautiful thing. We have been fighting among Nicaraguans for too long. But we are armed campesinos and we are willing to fight ... and we are not going to lay down our arms unless there is a definitive cease-fire.'' `` We will lay down our arms when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> lay down theirs, when there is a democratic government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.''

 The police chief is vowing to close down <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s honky-tonk district, which he claims had made it the `` Sin Capital of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.'' His targets are nightspots in the neighborhood known as the city's `` tourist belt,'' where scantily clad girls bump and grind to disco music and _ for a price _ go out with male customers. Although the <LOCATION> Ermita </LOCATION> district pumps millions of dollars each year into the city's economy, authorities have called for replacing the nightspots with more wholesome family entertainment. `` Now, we are known internationally as the center of the flesh trade, the <LOCATION> Sin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>, the capital's police chief, said recently. `` When we hear of this reference, all of us feel a furious sense of outrage, for we all know that we do n't deserve such notoriety.'' However, bar owners say the crackdown will cause worse problems, add to economic hardship and advance the spread of sexual disease. Last month, police began raiding bars and discos in the city's <LOCATION> Ermita </LOCATION> district They have rounded up more than 2,000 barmaids, known as `` hospitality girls,'' and detained dozens of foreigners who operate some of more than 505 bars, restaurants, discos, nightclubs and brothels in <LOCATION> Ermita </LOCATION>'s 10-block strip. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has backed the raids, saying `` what we should guard against is sacrificing the dignity and honor of the Filipino woman.'' But in a country with many economic problems, sex is big business. <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> said he expects bar owners _ mostly Americans, Australians, West Germans, Japanese and Filipinos _ to fight back by waging a smear campaign against him and his police force. `` They are employing all tricks to stop us so they can earn bundles and bundles of money,'' <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> said. `` They are capitalizing on our women.'' Indeed, an typical Ermita bar earns about $ 715 dollars on a regular day. The bigger establishments average about $ 1,666 daily. But <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Compuesto </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, said the raids have been hurting the once-thriving entertainment industry, cutting daily earnings by as much as 70 percent. Moreover, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rueda </PERSON>, operations manager of a leading club called Firehouse, said closing bars will force tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> prostitutes to go underground. She says that will make it difficult to trace carriers of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and venereal diseases. <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> said 80 percent of 2,000 women picked up in the raids have been found suffering from venereal disease. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said at least 50 Filipinos, mostly hospitality girls, have been infected with the AIDS virus, but none has developed its active symptoms. `` The problem of venereal disease will spread out because the women will become freelancers. They will hang around hotels and restaurants,'' <PERSON> Rueda </PERSON> said. `` Who will manage them and check them for diseases?'' <PERSON> Compuesto </PERSON> said his group has offered to help police by closing some establishments and ridding the area of free-lance prostitutes. But he says their offer has been ignored. `` If they are really trying to cure the problem of morality, this campaign should be nationwide,'' Compuesto said. `` How can they solve immorality, prostitution or drug abuse if they are only concentrating on Ermita?'' Other critics say closing <PERSON> Ermita </PERSON>'s seedy establishments would force some displaced workers into a life of crime. `` If you're starving and you're the only breadwinner in the family, I think there is nothing else to do,'' said <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Samson </PERSON>, a disc jockey <PERSON> Compuesto </PERSON> said most bar girls are earning more than the $ 3 minimum daily wage of factory workers, not counting what they earn once they leave the bars with customers. `` Thousands of people do n't have jobs. We have jobs that we enjoy, but now they want to get it from us,'' Compuesto said. `` What kind of logic is that?'' `` It's really a hypocrisy of people to say that when tourists come to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, they just want to see the sights in <LOCATION> Tagaytay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baguio </LOCATION> or some other part of the country,'' Compuesto said. `` They need entertainment.''

<HEAD>Court Takes Own Initiative And Reopens Civil Rights Ruling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civil rights groups are worried that a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision to reconsider a 12-year-old ruling on race discrimination could be the beginning of an effort to reverse basic legal advances for minorities. Conservatives see it as signaling the possible end of an era where they believe legal principles were bent to favor minorities. `` The message is there's a new court now that <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> -RRB- </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is on board and previous rulings are up for grabs,'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is an ominous development.'' By a 5-4 vote Monday, the justices took the unusual initiative of broadening the scope of a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> racial-harassment case so that they could consider limiting the ability of minorities to sue private citizens for monetary damages. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s legal director here, said the court's action will have `` enormous psychological impact'' by indicating `` basic civil rights decisions now may be considered open to attack. A conservative constitutional lawyer, hailing the action, said it comes from a court `` no longer willing to say, as it has in the past, that any statutory interpretation that is a victory for minorities automatically wins even if you've got to bend legal principles.'' The lawyer, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON>, visiting fellow in constitutional studies at the conservative think tank <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said the action could lead the court to take another look at other cases which represent `` really almost absurd efforts to rewrite intent and legislative history.'' `` This indicates to me,'' <PERSON> Fein </PERSON> said, `` that the court is going to take a hard look at statutory civil rights and be willing to overturn decisions where they were based on really flawed reasoning, even if the results are politically unpopular.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court in February, provided a fifth vote Monday to re-examine the 1976 ruling that expanded the right of minorities to sue over alleged discrimination. The other four are Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> were appointed to the court by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a frequent critic of rulings he regards as too liberal. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in a sharply worded dissent, said minorities may feel betrayed by the court's willingness to consider discarding an important civil rights precedent. He said the action is unwise activism and will `` have a detrimental and enduring impact on the public's perception of the court as an impartial adjudicator.'' He was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Their views were echoed by <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON>, who said the five in the majority `` have made careers of extolling the virtue of judicial restraint.'' <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> continued, `` In this case they have reopened a major strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure when neither party in the case has asked to do so and when there is no ferment in the courts below.'' The court majority, in an unsigned order, said, `` It is surely no affront to settled jurisprudence to request argument on whether a particular precedent should be modified or overruled.'' The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> case, argued last Feb. 29, now will be held over until the court's next term beginning in October. A ruling is likely in 1989. In the case, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a black woman, wants to use a post-Civil War law to force her employer, <ORGANIZATION> McClean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, to pay actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment. Lower federal courts said the law, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, is designed only to ban racial discrimination in hiring, firing and promotion _ not racial harassment. Ms. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> still could charge racial harassment under a 1964 civil rights law. But the more recent law provides that those who win their cases in court may collect back pay, not potentially big awards as compensation for emotional and mental suffering. Civil rights groups say the more limited 1964 law may not be a sufficient deterrent to harassment. The court agreed to use Ms. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s appeal to reconsider a 1976 ruling, called <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, that held that racially segregated private schools violate the 1866 law. The statute was enacted to ensure that recently freed slaves would enjoy all the rights of citizenship. The 1976 decision has given civil rights groups an important legal weapon to fight racial bias by permitting them to use the law as a basis for lawsuits against private individuals. In other action, the court: _ Turned away the first `` dial-a-porn'' case ever to reach it, letting stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone message services in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> _ Agreed to decide whether wardens of federal prisons should have sweeping power to say what publications inmates may read

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Reversing Field on Extent of U.S. Role in
Gulf</HEAD>

 New declarations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't want a `` serious shooting war'' with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> come amid signs that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is backing away from earlier proposals to broaden the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The new suggestions by top administration officials come after a week-long review of Persian Gulf policy triggered by the April 18 clash between the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in which six Iranian ships were damaged or sunk. Last week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had said the policy was under review, specifically the rules of engagement which permitted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> only to protect itself and 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. But on Monday, administration officials suggested that there may be no change in that policy. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> stressed that no final decision had been made, but said `` we will not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the Iranians.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reflected the new line, telling reporters that `` everybody acknowledges that we need to move back to some more limited set of rules.'' For the past 10 months, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships have been escorting the 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers through the gulf, which is one of the venues for the long Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is an ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has previously attacked Iranian forces and facilities in retaliation for Iranian mine-laying activities. Last week's clash was in revenge for an April 14 incident in which a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate hit a mine the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claimed was laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Administration officials had suggested last week that the rules might be changed to let the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aid other merchant ships should those vessels come under attack. `` Right now the rules of engagement are essentially the same as they were last week, reflecting the emergency nature of the situation,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday. `` But the question is, where do we move back to? ... I ca n't discuss specifics.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> where he was meeting with other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials, said `` as far as our rules of engagement are concerned, what the right ones are for this stage of the game in the gulf is being considered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and there is a process of consultation going on, and I think it's premature to describe them in any particular way. On April 18, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels were given wider latitude. `` You'll recall at that point that our ships were engaging hostile forces in any number of areas. And we now want to move back to our conservative set of rules. And so that decision has to be made about where to move back to ...'' One change may be the addition of up to six 110-foot <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats to help patrol the shallow gulf waters. That proposal was criticized on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where senators noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is already cutting back its anti-drug patrols and some routine search and rescue missions because of budget cuts. But the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has offered to pay for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> patrols `` Ridiculous, harebrained, absolute utter nonsense,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a critic of administration anti-drug policies. Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't know what the rationale for that would be. We've put a lot of additional burdens on the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in the last few years and I'd think they have a full plate.'' The committee will meet later this week to consider shifting money to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to meet a $ 100 million budget shortfall. The lightly armed `` Island'' class patrol boats would be pulled off anti-drug patrols in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. The boats would be replaced by new <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters now under construction. Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said `` if the president, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, think those boats would be a help over there, I'm more than delighted to send them and my <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel are ready to go. Really raring and ready to go.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but the agency also falls under <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction for national security purposes. The boats which would be used in the gulf operations have a maximum speed of more than 26 knots and carry a crew of 16. The vessels are armed with one 20mm machine gun in the front, and two 7.62 mm machine guns elsewhere Another 20mm machine gun can be added.

<TEXT>
 A teen-ager walking barefoot along a busy street was electrocuted when she stepped on a steel plate that covered wiring for a light post, authorities said. Sunday morning's accident that killed 17-year-old <PERSON> Veronika </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatriz </PERSON> <PERSON> Feria </PERSON> `` was just a death waiting to happen,'' said <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police spokesman. The street and wiring had been moved to make way for the entrance of a new shopping center. It was badly rewired and set the grating alive with 480 volts, said police and a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> and Light spokesman. Had the victim been wearing shoes, she probably would have been insulated from the current, said <ORGANIZATION> FPL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Feria </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, had been celebrating the 18th birthday of her best friend, <PERSON> Lina </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, on Saturday. They had gone to the beach with another friend, <PERSON> Beatriz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez-Aguirre </PERSON>, 29, and were on their way to her apartment shortly before 5 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> Feria </ORGANIZATION>'s friends received mild shocks when they tried in vain to revive her. A motorist, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, stopped to help and pulled her body off the plate using a towel for insulation, authorities said. <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON> said city workers investigating the accident told police a poorly insulated wire had been improperly positioned on the lip of the box beneath the steel plate. When the lid was placed on the box, the insulation was severed. `` It turned that cover into a hot plate,'' <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ostberg </PERSON> said he'd never heard of that happening. <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON> said it was unclear who was responsible for the wiring, but the investigation was continuing.

 Imagine it: newspaper stories next year that begin with the words, `` Vice President and Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said today that ...'' There would be a lot of ifs to be surmounted if <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s senior Democratic senator were in a position to assume such a jawbreaking and unprecedented dual title. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have to win the Democratic presidential nomination, ask <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> to be his running mate, offer him the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as an inducement to accept, and then win the fall campaign. But the idea is being floated _ apparently seriously _ by such leading Democrats as former <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>. Others say <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> as a prominent Southerner and respected defense expert would so strengthen a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket that he should be promised he could be secretary of state or national security adviser _ if he also agrees to run for vice president. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has said that no matter what inducements might be offered, his interest in the vice presidency is just about one on a scale of 10. But he has never said never. No vice president has ever served simultaneously as secretary of defense. No vice president has ever served simultaneously as a member of a president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. But a number of people who became vice president had previously served in presidential cabinets. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> served as vice president in one period and as secretary of state at another. Presidents have appointed vice presidents to task forces on one subject or another. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to head a task force on drugs and narcotics. President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> named his vice president, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, to head a task force on space exploration. Other vice presidents have had a strong influence on their administrations. But that has been the rare exception rather than the rule. While not barred by the Constitution, a vice president simultaneously serving as secretary of defense might well discover a thicket of unexpected conflicts. While the vice president has his job by election, a cabinet officer must be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The only job specifically assigned the vice president by the Constitution is to serve as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Unexpected strains might arise if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were asked to confirm its own presiding office to serve as well in a Cabinet post. In the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s presiding officer, the vice president's only real power is his ability to cast tie-breaking votes at moments of legislative impasse. Some senators might demand that a vice president who was also the secretary of defense abstain from breaking a tie on closely divided defense issues directly affecting his department. Such a decision would deprive the administration of its ability to decide the issue in its favor by breaking the tie. Since 1981 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has broken seven ties, five of them on defense issues. Secretaries of defense routinely testify before congressional committees in defense of military budgets. There is some potential awkwardness in a situation when the witness is also president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Concern might also be triggered if it became necessary for an elected vice president also serving as secretary of defense to travel with a president to an overseas conference. That would place both the president and vice president out of the country at the same time. And that might become a more worrisome situation if the country they were visiting were the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Naming <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> the national security adviser might create fewer such problems since the person who fills that post is not confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The vice presidency has not always been a happy post for the person who held the job. Many have complained it consists of little more than attending the funerals of foreign leaders. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, the nation's first vice president, had some thoughts on his job which he shared with his colleagues on the eve of a visit to their chamber by President <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Gentlemen, I feel great difficulty -LRB- in -RRB- how to act,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` I am possessed of two separate powers. I am vice president. In this I am nothing, but I may be everything. `` But I am president also of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. When the president comes into the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, what shall I be?'' Some politicians are still thinking about what a vice president shall be, at least when <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s name comes up for discussion.

 Soviet officials are giving up hopes of sharp cuts in strategic nuclear arsenals before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office and fear he may be returning to Red-baiting as he prepares to make his exit. `` The problem is that the American position is moving not forward but backward,'' said <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, chairman of the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` As far as I can see, we do n't have enough time to prepare any formal treaty'' before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit May 29-June 2, <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> said in an interview on Monday. <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, a non-voting member of the policymaking <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and former <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, blamed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political process for what he called wasted time since the summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December. `` Certainly we can not accomplish in the following four weeks what we have failed to do in four months,'' said <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>. `` Certainly, we can not expect miracles.'' <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> also criticized a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence report saying the Soviet economy has not improved despite economic reforms by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He said the joint report by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> analysts might have been done `` to show the president that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is almost on its deathbed and it needs just another push, that he should not talk with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but push it.'' <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> contested the pessimistic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence report, and said that under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> industrial production rose more than 4 percent last year and agricultural production was up 9 percent, `` higher than any rate in a decade.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence studies said the production of goods and services last year in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> grew by only 0.5 percent, after a 4 percent jump in 1986. <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> said the gloomy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence report and recent speeches by the president may signal a return to the harsh anti-Soviet rhetoric of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first years in office, when he called the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an `` evil empire.'' `` I would say that in his most recent speech, as well as his speeches in March and February, the president was preoccupied with rhetoric,'' said <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>. `` Bearing in mind that he will not remain in office for a long time, he is trying to say in his last speeches what he lost the chance to say in 1981 and 1982. `` We have already passed the time when we could tolerate such rhetorical escapades.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained after meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week that the administration was `` marking time'' in arms control negotiations. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said that he will not tailor his arms control positions to meet political deadlines, and does not expect the meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to wrap up the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent. Previously, Soviet officials were more optimistic in public assessments of the summit. <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>'s comments reflected what has become public pessimism by the Kremlin. <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> also accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of dragging its heels in negotiations for an international convention to curb chemical weapons and on <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact proposals for cuts in non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But whatever the prospects for the summit, said <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` will be accorded our very warm and very deep hospitalities.'' `` As we look at summits, we think they are convened not to express sentiments, but to become milestones in the development of bilateral and international relations,'' said <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>. `` This is a problem for the president, because it is important for him how he finishes his political career.'' At best, said <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, the meeting may produce a `` framework ... for the development of future negotiations. This will make negotiations easier.''

<HEAD>Bush Set To Lock In Nomination With Delegates Picked Today</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had a virtual lock on the Republican presidential nomination since late March, but today's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary should make it a mathematical certainty The contest, in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> only faces token opposition from former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, should raise his delegate total to more than the 1,139 needed for nomination at the GOP convention in August in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Savoring the situation on the eve of that vote, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an airport rally in <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on Monday: `` We got a break in this primary process. ... I'm glad it's gone my way.'' The vice president noted that due to his overwhelming lead in the race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, the campaign spotlight has been mostly on the Democratic contenders. But he said he was n't complaining `` The news is being dominated by the Jackson-Dukakis fight. That's the way it should be,' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I would n't trade places.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> predicted that the general election `` is going to be hard fought; it's going to be close.'' The vice president was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, both of which hold primaries a week from today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was attending a rally in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and holding an airport rally in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tells audiences he'll still campaign through to the end of the primary season and `` ca n't wait'' to debate the Democratic nominee, who he has predicted will be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Even so, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remains vague on the terms for such events. `` I'm not going to let some outside group, even within my own party, set the agenda,'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` I'll appoint somebody who knows about setting up debates'' and who could work with Democrats in coming up with a process agreeable to both parties, he said. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> that he fully backs President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vow to veto trade legislation nearing a final congressional vote. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped that some other way could be found to notify workers of impending plant closings. The bill _ which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would sign if he were president _ contains a provision requiring 60 days advance when plants are to be shut down. `` Maybe there's a compassionate way to give notice to a worker and his family. But it has nothing to do with the trade bill,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I know it's an emotional issue but -LRB- the bill -RRB- interferes with our ability to compete.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did acknowledge that there were still areas of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and elsewhere that had not shared fully in the economic recovery that is now in its sixth year. But he criticized Democrats, saying they `` talk about despair and agony.'' `` You're going to see a clear choice'' in the general election, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had a huge lead for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination since his remarkable 17-state sweep in the March 8 Super Tuesday contests, a lead he solidified with the withdrawal from the race on March 29 of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, his only remaining major rival. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is still technically a candidate but has ceased active campaigning, saying there is no way <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can be denied the nomination. He has a scant 31 delegates, to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1,081. At his campaign appearance Monday at the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre airport, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was confronted by about two dozen protesters. `` I'm glad to see the -LRB- <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters here, or maybe the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters,'' he said. Of the Democrats, he said: `` I will welcome them in debate, I will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them in the fall.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, two months on the job, has given liberals their first real cause for concern that he will help forge a solid conservative court majority. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was part of a 5-4 majority that said Monday it is thinking about overturning a 1976 decision considered a key civil rights victory. The ruling 12 years ago, never undone by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, interpreted a Civil War era law as allowing lawsuits for monetary damages against private businesses and individuals over alleged racial discrimination. The decision in <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, adopted in hundreds of lower court cases since, has become what one civil rights lawyer called `` a major strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure.'' Monday's announcement sparked sharp criticism and dire predictions. Four justices said it could shake minorities' faith in the court. `` Time alone will tell whether the erosion of faith is unnecessarily precipitous,'' said Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a swing vote who most often sides with the court's liberals. `` But in the meantime some of the harm that will flow from today's order may never be completely undone.'' <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` The message is there's a new court and previous rulings are up for grabs,'' he said. `` If this decision possibly can be overturned, perhaps a lot more are endangered.'' The court's three <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees _ Kennedy and Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> _ joined Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> in voting to restudy the 1976 decision. Joining <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in dissent were Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, the court's leading liberals, and Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, another swing vote. Will there be five votes to overturn the 1976 precedent? <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, long the court's most conservative member, and <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a conservative with a generally liberal voting record in civil rights cases, dissented from the 1976 decision. Two likely votes to overturn. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> is considered as conservative as <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. A third vote. The keys may be the votes of <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who in recent years has shown greater independence from the court's conservative bloc, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last Feb. 18. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation only after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> was rejected. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s critics in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and among the civil rights organizations who opposed him said they feared his replacing centrist <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> on the court could threaten 30 years of civil rights precedents. In its first seven years, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has had little success persuading the court to adopt the president's conservative agenda: outlawing abortion, restoring prayers in public schools and curtailing affirmative action <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, whose views on such matters are unknown, is viewed as a staunch conservative less ideological than <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. Some liberals voiced the hope that he would assume <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s role as the court's voice of judicial restraint But the concerns voiced during the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> nomination fight were echoed Monday. Calling <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> the key to a `` new court,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> had an extensive record of civil rights animus and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not. But this is n't encouraging.''

<HEAD>Report Says Nuclear Agency Should Improve Its Internal

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> says he agrees with a congressional study recommending that the agency improve its internal investigations. He made the statement Monday as his agency released a study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> needs to ensure that its investigations are done professionally and competently. `` The commission will give careful consideration to -LRB- the -RRB- entire report in our continuing efforts to assure that we carry out our investigative responsibilities fairly and efficiently,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said. In the study, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said `` the important mission and critical safety role of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> require that it possess a first-rate investigative capability.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative wing of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the study was based on review of three investigations made within the nuclear agency. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that in two cases, the work done by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Inspector and Auditor was not thorough enough One case involved allegations by an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspector that superiors had pressured him to change findings in 1986 about safety conditions at the <ORGANIZATION> Comanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The other involved alleged improper discussions in 1986 between <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director of operations, and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>'s NRC-regulated nuclear program. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said its review supported the findings of <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigators who said neither matter was improper. But in both cases <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigators had not interviewed individuals with key roles. The third case looked into <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s probe of how a copy of an internal <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> document turned up in 1985 in the files of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s Waterford III plant _ along with a memo from <ORGANIZATION> LPL </ORGANIZATION>'s holding company saying the document had been `` received from sources inside'' the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said notations on the copy indicated it was duplicated from the file copy in the office of <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who was in charge of investigating the alleged leak. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> was critical of the `` very limited'' investigation made by <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it was unable to determine how the copy reached the regulated utility. `` A properly conducted investigation might have provided <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> with the identity'' of the leaker, according to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. The case, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, `` demonstrated that a regulated utility secured unauthorized access to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> documents. The ability to obtain such materials could impact on the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement program, licensing functions and regulatory procedures.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> should assure that its investigators conduct their work in a competent manner using professional standards,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, adding that there is a lack of coordination between the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of Inspector and Auditor

Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., appealed on Monday for swift action on the treaty He said the president deserves to be accommodated on his wish not to go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> empty-handed. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said it is important for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ratify the treaty before he meets <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> because there is little chance the two sides will make further arms control progress unless the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has acted favorably. But Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> said he refused `` to be rushed or harried'' on the matter before remaining problems are cleared away. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he will not call up the treaty for debate before May 9. He added he may not do so then unless it can be shown the Soviets agree with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that the pact bans medium-range `` futuristic'' weapons such as those using laser rays or particle beam generators. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and other Republicans huddled Monday with White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> to devise a strategy to deal with <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s concerns and get the treaty debate started. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> replied: `` I want to accommodate the president too, and will accommodate the president where I can. ... But that is not my first responsibility. ... That is not my first objective. `` I'm going to accommodate the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and our responsibilities under the Constitution first, before the accommodation of anybody else or any other office.'' The treaty is silent on future weapons, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators contend the pact bans all weapons with ranges of from 300 miles to 3,400 miles, no matter how they are armed.

<HEAD>Veterans Of Atomic Testing, WWII To Get Benefits Under Senate Vote</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The quarter-million `` atomic veterans'' exposed to radiation during World War II and open-air nuclear tests in the two decades that followed would receive new health benefits under a bill before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The Democratic-controlled chamber is expected to vote on the bill this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed it Monday by a 48-30 vote. House passage would send the measure to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has threatened to veto the legislation because of its high costs and because administration officials claim there is no scientific basis for the bill. The measure would cost an estimated $ 36 million in its first year to pay for extra medical benefits. The 250,000 surviving atomic veterans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service personnel who took part in the occupation of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic bombs were dropped on those two Japanese cities in August 1945, or who took part in open-air tests of atomic weapons in the southern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Many of the servicemen wore little or no protective gear during the tests, and some have claimed that their exposure to radiation caused cancer. The bill would make a presumptive finding that 13 different cancers are related to their radiation exposure during the tests or the Japanese service. Existing law provides that veterans who have cancer can be compensated or receive health benefits, but they must show in each case that the cancer is related to the military service. Only 28 of the nearly 5,000 veterans who have filed radiation-related claims with the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have been approved for disability benefits. The bill now before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> began as an amendment to a much larger health and compensation bill for the nation's 27.4 million military veterans. But the `` atomic veteran'' provision was dropped after the White House said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto a measure containing the amendment. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, supported the measure because, he told his colleagues, `` it is time to be fair to these men. But Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., said the bill `` just ignores sound, medical scientific evidence ... It's just an absurd approach toward compensation.'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said that `` scientists are still unsure about how much level ionizing radiation causes cancer.'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., agreed _ up to a point `` We do not yet know the full relationship between low-level radiation and latent illness,'' he said. `` But it is crystal clear that many of those responsible for setting policies that affect thousands of our citizens are intent upon making the facts fit their theories and decisions instead of the other way around.''

<HEAD>Possible Genetic Basis for Kidney Disease Among Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black people may have a gene that gives their kidneys the unique ability to function well on very limited amounts of salt, but which also can cause high blood pressure and disease when too much salt is consumed, a researcher suggested today. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said the existence of this unique kidney gene is suggested by the mixed results of efforts to prevent disease by controlling high blood pressure among black people. Speaking at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> seminar, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> said controlling high blood pressure, or hypertension, has resulted in a reduction in stroke and heart disease. But it has not caused a reduction in the rate of a kidney disease caused by hypertension. And striking differences between the races suggest there may be a genetic-based difference in the cause of high blood pressure. `` All kidney disease is more common among blacks than whites,'' said <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>, the chairman of the department of internal medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION>. `` End-stage renal disease -LRB- terminal kidney failure -RRB- is three times more common in blacks than in whites.'' He said that at a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> transplant center, which performs about half its transplants on black patients, there have been many instances where kidneys transplanted from a white donor to a black patient with high blood pressure has resulted in the recipient becoming `` normotensive,'' or achieving a normal blood pressure. `` This suggests that the cause of the original high blood pressure was the patient's own kidneys,'' he said. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> said hypertension among laboratory animals also has been controlled by the transplant of kidneys from `` normotensive'' rats to ones with high blood pressure. Studies also have shown, he said, that black people tend to retain more salt, excreting less of the mineral in their urine than white people. All of this suggests, said <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>, `` that a hereditary kidney abnormality may actually cause high blood pressure.'' He said there is speculation that this kidney characteristic developed through evolution in central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> where salt is naturally very limited. In that environment, the kidney characteristic represented a `` Darwinian advantage'' for people who lived there, he said. `` In very hot and dry climates in inland areas of low availability of -LRB- salt -RRB-,'' he said, `` an ability of the kidney to carefully and quickly conserve salt may confer a survival advantage in evolution.'' That advantage, however, becomes a disadvantage and eventually leads to disease if there is an overabundance of salt in the diet, said <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>. `` Chronic but subtle salt retention may lead over long periods to high blood pressure possibly as a complication of the body's response to try to force the kidney to excrete more salt,'' he said And high blood pressure, in turn, often leads to kidney disease, heart attack and stroke. Medication can control the high blood pressure and reduce heart attack and stroke, but there is no similar reduction in kidney disease, he said. But a genetic basis for high blood pressure is still speculation, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> said in an interview, `` and a puzzle that we are still trying to understand.''

<TEXT>
 It was story time for 28 toddlers and the choice was an old favorite, `` The Very Hungry Caterpillar.'' But the storyteller was a newcomer to the Discovery School _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner in today's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. He was a hit with the preschool set. Monday was a day of big crowds and loud cheers for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was trying out a relaxed campaign style. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a big lead over rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and about all aides had to wonder about was how big a delegate victory he could win in the state. `` I look forward to working with you and to winning with you tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told about 500 people in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on the eve of the primary. In his final day of campaigning before the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> vote, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was at ease and ready to quip. `` I saw a Bush sign around here some place,'' he asked 1,000 gathered on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scranton </ORGANIZATION> campus. `` You know, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the only guy who had a baseball league named after him. Then he asked if the crowd held any fans of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> _ the team with the worst record in baseball at the moment. `` Where are the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> fans around here? You know if you're an Orioles fan you have to be headed for a career in social work or something. You have to be very charitable,'' he said. But <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION> brought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> face-to-face with some of the most strident demonstrators of the campaign thus far. Fifty anti-abortion protesters sought to form a gantlet for the candidate outside the hall at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scranton </ORGANIZATION>. `` Stop <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>! Stop abortion!'' they chanted. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was escorted to the car by a group of aides and police officers, amid much pushing and shoving. From <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, from Erie to <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took his message of jobs and party unity. `` There is no more important challenge facing the president of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Make no mistake about it. I'm a dyed-in-the-wool, true-blue full-employment Democrat,'' he said in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. He repeatedly urged his supporters to ignore the polls and to get out the vote _ `` Pollsters do n't vote,'' he said. A win in the complicated election Tuesday would boost his lead for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination in both delegates and momentum. `` It is n't enough just to vote for me,'' he told 2,000 cheering supporters at a park in Erie. `` This is one election where you've got to vote more than once and it's legal I need your vote as a candidate. Our delegates need your votes. ... We must do both.'' The crowd was enthusiastic, often interrupting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with applause and cheers.

Smiling, he kisssed them. `` With your help, we can leave <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> with the kind of enthusiasm and the kind of energy and the kind of momentum that a victory will give,'' he told them. At his first stop in <LOCATION> Phildelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reached out to the black community that is the core of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support. `` We have too much to do in this country to divide ourselves,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told about 60 people gathered a black church in <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I'm someone who believes that one of the jobs of a governor and a president _ perhaps the most important job _ is to bring this country together, brown, black and white, business and labor.

 A strike by 15,000 clerical workers interrupted domestic airline service and forced many shops and businesses to close. The workers began their strike on Friday in an attempt to win a 27 percent increase for the lowest paid among them. <ORGANIZATION> Icelandair </ORGANIZATION> halted local flights because of the strike, and clerical workers were expected to walk out of <LOCATION> Keflavik </LOCATION> international airport on Wednesday. Hotels in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> were nearly empty on Monday, and hotel managers said their financial loss will be considerable if the strike continues. The workers struck after the employers' organization turned down a demand by the unions that minimum wages be increased by 27 percent.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> needs to get serious about seeking solutions to `` an increasingly chaotic condition'' in global agricultural trade, says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> `` is unwilling to even define a longterm goal in the reform of the rules of international trade,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` They term our proposal to eventually eliminate trade-distorting subsidies as ` unrealistic' or ` too far, too fast.' Yet, they have not stated what alternative they will accept.'' It has been almost a year and a half since the new <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of multinational trade talks began under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. Yet, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said, the major agricultural shippers are expanding export subsidies rather than reducing them. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> warned that failure to make progress in the negotiations by the time of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> midterm review in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> next December `` will bring into question the chance for eventual success'' of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round. `` I'm not pessimistic, but I'll have to admit there's not a whole lot to be optimistic about at this point,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has just paid a subsidy equal to $ 126 per metric ton to wheat exporters, and continues to pay `` huge subsidies on a host of other commodities'' including mixed feed, $ 291 per ton; durum wheat, $ 281 per ton; and barley, $ 130 per ton. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, is calling for agricultural trade reform at the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round. Ultimately, under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, international trade barriers and subsidies would be eliminated over a period of 10 years or so. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the `` excessive influence of governments in farm product markets leads to a grossly inefficient allocation of resources in developed countries and leave poorer, developing countries in economic shambles.'' The worst offenders are the big nations `` who are unwilling or reluctant to change,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with huge trade surpluses from exports of industrial and consumer goods, clings to import barriers on products such as beef, rice and citrus. Other exporting countries, including the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, say they are not alone in subsidizing agricultural trade and point to the Export Enhancement Program operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, as it is known, private exporters are given surplus USDA-owned commodities so they can sell grain or other products to selected foreign countries, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and others. Department officials claim <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> was necessary to compete with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s subsidized exports. After <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> spoke to the farm editors, his department routinely announced several more export subsidy actions under the program. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was sold an additional 95,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, which carried subsidies of $ 27.52 per ton. Another EEP subsidy was for 300 tons of frozen broiler chickens or fryer legs sold to the <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The subsidies amounted to about $ 237 per ton. Officials said an additional 400 tons of frozen poultry are still available for sale to the <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> at subsidized prices.

 A private contractor has helped farmers in five southwest <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> counties beat a federal deadline for conservation planning, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday a consulting company _ <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ completed planning by mid-April, less than half the time called for in its one-year contract. The 1985 farm law gives farmers until Dec. 31, 1989, to complete conservation plans for protecting highly erodible land. Scaling said district conservationists in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said they would not be able to help all the farmers with planning in time to meet the deadline. `` One of the most successful ideas was to contract out the planning to a qualified private company,'' he said. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> has the second-largest amount of cropland of any state, some 29.1 million acres, he said. Of that, the agency estimates more than one-third is highly erodible.

<TEXT>
 A bill banning abortion, which sponsors said was designed to force the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider a 1973 decision, fell just one vote short of passage in the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Supporters said they may attempt to revive the measure, termed `` obviously unconstitutional'' by its opponents. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 30-28 in favor of the bill, one short of the 31 needed for passage. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> legalized abortion with its landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision in 1973. Backers of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> legislation, which would have made abortion illegal except to save the life of the mother, said they believed that the present <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> might reverse the 1973 decision if given the chance to do so. Supporters of the bill said its passage would make <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> the first state to outlaw abortion since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. Noting how close they had come to getting the bill passed, backers said they would consider bringing it back for another vote before the end of the current legislation session. But, even if it succeeds in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the chances of the bill's becoming law appeared to be slim Gov. Rose Mofford announced that she probably would veto it. `` My impression is that it's unconstitional,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said, adding `` I ca n't legislate morality.''

<TEXT>
 `` Beetlejuice,'' the supernatural spoof featuring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>'s romp in the hereafter, was the nation's film box office leader last weekend, beating `` Casual Sex? and `` Colors'' by a wide margin. `` Beetlejuice'' returned $ 6.2 million while the teen-movie `` Casual Sex?'' narrowly edged the gang-film `` Colors'' for the No. 2 spot. Both movies made $ 3.8 million. Other than a few fistfights, the debut two weeks ago of `` Colors'' did n't incite the violence predicted by some officials. But last weekend, gunfire erupted between suspected gang members outside a theater in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gang member reportedly upset with the way his gang was depicted in the movie fatally shot a possible rival gang member. Mann Theaters of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> voluntarily pulled the movie from the Regency Theater where the shooting occurred, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. The non-stop carnage in `` Above the Law,'' featuring a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cop's single-handed drug-ring battle, brought in $ 3.2 million to finish fourth last weekend. `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' the <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> yarn starring <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> boot camp private, was fifth at $ 2.8 million. `` The Last Emperor,'' the <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> epic that won nine Academy Awards earlier this month, was sixth with $ 2.6 million and `` Moonstruck,'' which won Oscars for <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was seventh with $ 2.3 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> took the No. 8 and No. 9 spots with `` Return to Snowy River II'' and `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' respectively. The `` Snowy River'' sequel brought in $ 2.1 million and `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' grossed $ 1.4 million. The Robert Redford-directed film `` Milagro Beanfield War'' rounded out the top 10 with $ 1.4 million. Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in release, and estimated production costs when available. 1. `` Beetlejuice,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 6.2 million, 1,582 screens, $ 3,919 per screen, $ 40.36 million, four weeks, n-a. 2. `` Casual Sex?''

 Belgians crave crawdads but have yet to sample catfish, while Saudi Arabians find American rice so much to their liking that they package rice from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to make it look as if it came from here, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> says. Those are a few of the useful bits of knowledge for Americans who want to export food products compiled by the department in a recent 204-page book called `` Trade Policies and Market Opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Farm Exports.'' It tells of quotas, tariffs, surcharges, health and sanitary rules and other restrictions that plague American exporters to more than 100 countries. The April issue of the department's magazine, `` Foreign Agriculture,'' gives an account of the report. For example, wine ca n't be advertised in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> _ governments there want to hold down drinking. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, it's margarine that ca n't be advertised because the government wants to protect French dairy farmers from competition on their sales of butter <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> wo n't buy almonds at all because it's protecting its meager stock of foreign exchange. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> wo n't buy tallow for religious reasons: the cows it is made from are sacred to Hindus. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is said to know too little about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tallow to order it. None of the 12 countries in the European Community will buy foreign meat if it's mixed with soy protein _ they say it's to protect consumers. There's no duty in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on imports of that American rice the Saudis like so much. <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> neighbor, buys rice almost entirely from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The book makes no judgment on whether the obstacles are fair or unfair, an issue much discussed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the current debate on the trade bill. `` Virtually every country provides support and protection to agriculture in some degree,'' it explains. `` In some cases this is done primarily through policies that raise prices to consumers by protecting the domestic market; in other cases, assistance is provided through subsidies financed by the taxpayer.'' In some cases, the countries do not believe that their actions constitute barriers. In other cases, the book implies that American producers could do more to sell their products. Under the heading `` reason for the barrier'' a frequent explanation is `` lack of awareness.'' That is the cause it gives for low sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> not only of American catfish and crayfish _ which are lumped together _ but also grapefruit juice, frozen potatoes, wood panel products, hardwoods from temperate climates and beer. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> is also noted as a country where lack of awareness of the American product keeps down the sale of catfish. The book says nothing about the Belgian appetite for crayfish, which is considerable.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Tuesday decided to sign the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, a strong indication it will not seek nuclear warheads for intermediate-range missiles it recently acquired from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 A newly modified <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jet which has radar and infrared systems will enable pilots to lock onto and track suspected drug traffickers' planes through clouds or darkness. The first of a fleet of nine Nighthawks, as they're nicknamed, was dedicated at a ceremony Monday in a hangar at National Airport. `` It's a particularly bad day for those who would smuggle drugs into this country,'' Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said at the dedication. `` Now that I've got these aircraft, I say to the drug smugglers two things: If you're in the business, I'd look for other employment, and you can run but you ca n't hide,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. The planes, which will initially be based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, are modified versions of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s medium-range surveillance jet, the HU-25A Guardian, built by <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, Ark. They have been equipped with a sensor system that combines the long-range radar used in the F-16 fighter jet with a forward-looking infrared, or FLIR, sensor. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> planes were equipped with a radar system designed to track ships and no infrared at all, said Lt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Quirk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> interceptor pilot who flew the first completed Nighthawk to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the dedication. `` Before, we did not have any altitude information -LRB- on the target planes -RRB-; we did not have any closure speed information besides what we could judge with our eyeball,'' Quirk said. `` This jet is twice as fast as any other <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who appeared at the dedication. `` It can fly at 380 knots at 20,000 feet above sea level for five hours up to 2,045 miles.'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>, who also participated in the ceremony, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` under siege'' by drug dealers. `` When you're under attack by a formidable enemy ... you've got to have state-of-the-art weaponry and you've got to have leadership,'' he said. The project, which cost approximately $ 47 million for all nine jets including training for about 30 pilots, was funded through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> predicted that eventually all the planes would be based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to stem drug smuggling from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>.

 Sheriff's deputies arrested a man Monday night in the weekend shooting death of a pregnant woman who gave birth minutes before she died. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>, 44, was arrested about 7:30 p.m. at a <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> residence and was being booked for investigation of first-degree murder in Friday night's slaying of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said. The woman was shot in the head at a <ORGANIZATION> Kearns </ORGANIZATION> video store during a robbery and died minutes after giving birth by Caesarean section to a fourth daughter. Authorities received an anonymous tip Sunday night regarding <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>' whereabouts, <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said. Hundreds of calls had been received in the case. `` We're always waiting for the one that rings the bell. This was one of them,'' he said. <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> also is wanted in <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for property crimes, and has a long list of arrests in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said. A second man authorities have said might have driven the car away from the store had not been located, but <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said authorities had some leads on his whereabouts. The woman, eight months pregnant, was shot in the Voyager Video store as her three daughters and three neighbor children watched. After getting between $ 300 to $ 350 from the clerk and stuffing the cash in in a green canvas bag, the gunman grabbed her, placed his handgun against her head and shot her, authorities said. Just before the woman died, the baby girl was delivered at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The infant was in serious but stable condition Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Tug Of War Over Trade Bill Under Way in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A tug of war is under way in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as sponsors of a 1,000-page trade bill move to line up enough votes to show they could override a threatened presidential veto. `` You let this bill go down the tubes and I'll tell you where the champagne corks will be popping,'' <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told senators Monday. `` They'll be popping in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and they'll be popping in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' The bill is expected to clear the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with votes to spare. But from there it heads for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and, evidently, a presidential veto. The question is whether it will receives the two-thirds support it would need to override a veto. Sponsors and the administration are looking for any wavering votes they can still find. Major provisions of the bill would streamline the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import curbs to punish international trade violations and aid industries threatened by foreign competition. Other provisions range from billions of dollars in new agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies. The administration has saved most of its fire lately for a provision that would require all but the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had been set to vote today, but with neither side satisfied that it had done everything possible, leaders said they might wait until Wednesday. As the showdown neared, lawmakers and congressional staffers on both sides said the outcome appeared too close to call. Democrats were expected to vote for the bill overwhelmingly while Republicans were divided on whether to stand by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in hopes of getting a slimmed-down version later. `` It's close,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters. `` It was an uphill battle, but now it's a tossup.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure 312-107 on Thursday, more than enough to override a veto. `` I know this is an election year and the majority party may be looking for a campaign issue rather than a trade bill, but I am confident the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could pass a better bill if this one is rejected,'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., said Democratic leaders have been saying it would be tough to bring another trade bill onto the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaves <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to campaign full time this fall. For one thing, they say, bringing such a bill onto the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor without something like the year of committee consideration that shaped the current version could make the new one a target for an array of amendments that in themselves could torpedo the measure. As dubious as they have been about a stripped-down trade bill, however, Democratic leaders have left the door open a crack for such an effort if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto is sustained. One of the first items to go in any new bill could be the plant-closings provision. Business groups say it would dry up capital for investment and frighten off customers, but it has strong backing from labor. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` high officials of the administration'' had told him that portions of the bill `` are acceptable to the administration. `` We pulled off the hat trick, we pulled off the miracle,'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said. `` The administration now says that while it's not perfect it is something that the president would be willing to sign without plant closings.''

<HEAD>Fish Oil May Solve Serious Transplant Drug Problem, Says
Researcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fish oil may help the thousands of patients each year who receive life-saving organ transplants only to develop serious kidney disease from the toxic effects of a drug needed to prevent organ rejection, a researcher says. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Monday that three medical centers now are testing the use of fish oil to smooth out the harsh side effects of cyclosporine, a drug taken by transplant patients to prevent organ rejection. The beneficial effects of cyclosporine have made it possible for thousands to receive kidney, heart and liver transplants. The primary action of the drug is to supress the body's immune response. Side effects of the drug, however, can be very serious for patients already in delicate health. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, speaking at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> seminar, said virtually every patient who takes cyclosprine suffers some change in kidney function, probably as the result of constricted flow through blood vessels of the kidney. At least one heart transplant patient, he said, has survived the transplant operation only to suffer complete kidney failure due to the toxic effects of cyclosporine. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said he and other researchers determined in laboratory studies that by mixing cyclosporine with a fish oil high in omega-3 fatty acid its bad side effects can be reduced without blocking the good results. Oil from fishes such as salmon and other cold water fish, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, are known to reduce the formation of thromboxanes, a protein that causes blood vessels to constrict. In laboratory animals, he said, this effect of fish oil seems to counter kidney damage caused by cyclosporine. A limited number of patients now are receiving the fish oil and cyclosporine at clinics in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said if the toxic effects of cyclosporine can be countered successfully, then there may be expanded uses for the drug. Use of cyclosporine has been suggested in such auto immune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis and some types of diabetes. Another researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> seminar said extensive clinical trials are under way on a new genetically-engineered hormone that will counter anemia among patients who must depend on artificial kidneys. Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eschbach </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said more than 100,000 Americans with failed kidneys are receiving dialysis, a procedure that cleans the blood of impurities normally filtered out by the kidneys. Up to 75,000 of these patients suffer from anemia, characterized by a shortage in their blood of red cells, which carry oxygen to the cells. For about 25,000, the problem is so serious that they must receive blood transfusions. Because of the anemia, <PERSON> Eschbach </PERSON> said that only about a third of the dialysis patients are able to return to work and many `` become part of the couch. All they can do is just lie there.'' The federal government spends about $ 2 billion a year caring for dialysis patients, he said, and some of this money could be saved if more patients were able to correct their anemia. <PERSON> Eschbach </PERSON> said research has shown that the reason for this anemia is that the failed kidneys no longer produce a hormone called erythropoietin. In normal function, the kidneys secrete this hormone when red cells are reduced in the blood. The hormone goes to the bone marrow and causes blood formation tissue there to make more red blood cells. Scientists have now isolated the human gene that makes the hormone. This gene has been inserted into the nucleus of Chinese hamster ovary cells which now are producing large amounts of erythropoietin. Dialysis patients who have received erythropoietin injections, said <PERSON> Eschbach </PERSON>, have recovered from their anemia and many have returned to work. Some have improved to the point that they have been able to receive kidney transplants and are no longer on dialysis, he said. The hormone now is in clinical trials and is expected to be available for general use by next spring.

<HEAD>North, Other Iran-Contra Defendants on Collision Course with Judge</HEAD>

 Lawyers for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his Iran-Contra co-defendants are on a collision course with the judge, as they argue for dismissal of the case on grounds that evidence was gathered illegally. A pre-trial hearing Monday began on a sour note for the defense team, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled lawyers for North and two other defendants violated his ground rules for the hearing, and would be barred from presenting any witnesses. From that point the proceeding rolled downhill for the defense lawyers, as <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rebuffed their request to question the top prosecutors _ and grand jury witnesses _ about their exposure to testimony given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under a grant of immunity. Nor would <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> permit the defense to immediately review instructions given by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and his staff to grand jurors, when they were advised in their secret proceedings to avoid news accounts of the congressional hearings. `` I have a great sense of unfairness for my client,'' complained <PERSON> North </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as the hearing dragged on. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> responded moments later, `` I do n't think lawyers should run'' the hearing. `` I should.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> made no final ruling on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s charge of `` enormous taint'' in the case, and the judge scheduled another hearing for Wednesday. If <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> finds after that hearing questions remain about the validity of the prosecution evidence, he can order further hearings on the subject that could push back the judge's initial hope for a July trial date. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is barred from using a witness' immunized testimony to prosecute that witness, except for perjury. However, the judge said it would still be possible to have a trial even if some evidence were obtained improperly, because the `` tainted'' evidence and certain witnesses could be barred from the case. Three defendants testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer under immunity grants: <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer who directed the once-secret operations that sent arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such assistance was prohibited by law; his boss at the time, National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>; and businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, who handled the millions of dollars in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales profits that were stashed in Swiss bank accounts. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s partner, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, is the fourth defendant but his leadoff testimony at the congressional hearings was given without an immunity grant. The defendants are charged with conspiring to use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales profits illegally to aid the Contras, and to cover up their actions. They also are accused of theft of government property, obstruction of government inquiries, making false statements, and destruction of documents. While Monday's proceedings were under way, defense lawyers filed a notice that they would appeal <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s pre-trial rulings that went against them. The judge had invited them to do so during the hearing, saying the defense objections `` stand out like the Statue of Liberty.'' `` Go ahead and have your romp upstairs -LRB- in the appeals court -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. The only witness Monday was <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who testified about his repeated written and oral instructors to his staff, to witnesses and to grand jurors to avoid being influenced by immunized testimony. He said his evidence was gathered independently, and filed weekly with the court. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> did admit, however, that one of his assistants, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, has voluntarily withdrawn from aspects of the case because of possible exposure to immunized testimony. `` I do n't know anything about the conditions'' that prompted <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s decision, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` He did n't want to taint me. I do n't know whether he was tainted or not. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> hammered again and again at <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s admission that he did n't know whether everyone complied with his orders. Compliance, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said, sometimes required a degree of common sense. The prosecutor sarcastically told <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> `` there was no discussion of how quickly you could turn off the television'' if a report on the congressional hearings came on. And when <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> pointed out that comedy shows such as `` Saturday Night Live'' made references to immunized testimony, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he had no idea whether those receiving his instructions turned off the programs. But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said each of his assistants knows `` he's jeopardizing the investigation if he's careless.'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a former federal judge and veteran prosecutor representing <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> on the immunity issue, said he can show `` every bit of the evidence was independently derived.'' `` The extensive procedures of insulation are just extras and are really not needed,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appears to be retaining the support of his most loyal constituencies, the Arab-Americans, despite upsetting many of them with comments about <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` There's still a great deal of spirit out there for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' especially after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> modified his remarks on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Arab-Americans have contributed more than $ 400,000 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential campaign, including some $ 90,000 raised Sunday at a private home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, according to his key <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> affairs adviser <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON> A handful of fund-raising events are scheduled in coming weeks in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. One of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s most prominent Arab-American backers, radio personality <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON>, is planning a big fundraiser in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> just before <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 primary. And there are 43 Arabs and Muslims running to be <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Salam </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Marayati </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appears to have assuaged the concerns of some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> supporters who were upset by his comment on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' that as president he would not meet with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of `` caving in'' to Jewish groups, and said many members of his group were dismayed by the TV interview. But the transcript of a subsequent interview that was printed in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> seemed to `` clear up any misunderstandings,'' <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON> said. In that interview, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pointed out there is a law, which he said should be changed, prohibiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials from talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does not recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is `` by far the most representative organization of the Palestinian people'' and should be represented at the negotiating table. The developments were important to many Arab-Americans, who have long looked to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as their voice in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political world. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s relationship with the Arabs goes back to 1979 when as a private but well-known citizen he visited the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on a fact-finding tour and was photographed embracing <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. That picture still angers many American Jews. But the Arabs see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a leader who is interested in the rights of their people as well as the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. For many years <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has held that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy against negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is counterproductive. His support for establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland also has endeared him to the Arabs. But he also contends the Arab states and Palestinians must recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. During <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign, his Arab ties created a stir when it was disclosed that his Chicago-based civil rights organization had received $ 200,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a group of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments. The contributions to the education-oriented PUSH for Excellence and the PUSH Foundation caused controversy, especially among Jewish groups who contended <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was too dependent on Arab money. <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Arab-Americans, who number an estimated 2 million throughout the country mostly concentrated in about a dozen cities, had achieved finanical and social security but felt excluded politically until <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential race. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brought them into the process and they do n't forget that.'' He acknowledged <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s televised comments two weeks ago caused, `` an initial round of concern.'' But he said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> support again was pouring in by the time the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign ended April 19, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had savaged <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as being anti-Israeli. After the `` Face the Nation'' interview, some members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab-Americans </ORGANIZATION> raised questions, said <PERSON> Liela </PERSON> <PERSON> Calnan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coordinator for the group. `` They did n't understand. I know a few Arabs in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that thought the would be turning against them,'' she said. But she said they were willing to give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> another chance because of his record. `` He defends Palestinians constantly ... He never fails, whether there's Arabs there or not, to mention Palestinian self determination.'' She said Arabs would be unlikely to support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` because of his wife'' who is Jewish. <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON> initially wrote a public letter to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> accusing him of `` tailoring your positions'' to appease Jewish voters before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had said on `` Face the Nation'' that it `` would be a mistake'' to try and sit <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at a negotiating table with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> because that would be `` asking for a bonafide explosion.'' Asked if he himself would sit down with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, he said, `` I would not. And it's not necessary to do that. We must not equate <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> an the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> with a sovereign people, the Palestinian people.''

<HEAD>Jackson Makes Election-Eve Appeal At Harrisburg Rally</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made an election-eve appeal for support in today's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, telling a chanting crowd at a rally: `` This room is full of hope today. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came to the state capital for a meeting with Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and staged a rally that drew a crowd of 2,000. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was holding meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this morning with a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and heading later to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which holds its primary a week from today. At the <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> rally, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stressed the themes that have been the cornerstone of his campaign: reversing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration economic policies, fighting drug abuse, and bringing more Americans into the political process. `` This room is full of hope today. A great dimension of our campaign is to keep hope alive. Our mission is to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the crowd. `` In this room today are farmers and workers; the black, the white, the brown, the red, the yellow, the middle class, the lower class ... We the people have come together to find common ground,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign stop in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> was one of several he made across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Monday, the day before the state's 2.8 million Democrats were going to the polls to voice their preference for the party's presidential nominee. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also made appearances in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where much of his support is rooted. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was questioned repeatedly about a statement he made Sunday regarding negotiation with terrorists. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday he could conceive of situations where he would grant safe passage to hostage-takers, saying `` I choose negotiation over blind bloody confrontation.'' He rejected what he called `` material concessions'' to terrorists but did not rule out political accommodation `` If we are going to deter terrorism, we must address the underlying causes of terrorism,'' he said after an appearance at a high school in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` Terrorism does not emerge out of the blue.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Sunday he disagreed with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position that `` we should not negotiate with terrorists.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I disagree with that; if I could get the hostages out, I'd do it.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will `` talk to anyone, to any group, to any government about the well-being and release of the Americans still held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' But she added, `` We will not make concessions to terrorists or compromise our fundamental principles.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who polls say is lagging behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in today's contest, has been campaigning heavily in urban areas in recent days. A poll released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> KYW-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KDKA-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by 26 percentage points, with 57 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 31 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 12 percent undecided. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> arrived at the <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> rally behind schedule. The wait, however, did not dampen the spirits of those attending the rally, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was greeted at the podium by thunderous applause and shouts of encouragement. `` I seek to lead our nation beyond racism, beyond sexism, beyond anti-Semitism, beyond escapism and beyond war. We must make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better and keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said to cheers. He called for more spending to fight drug abuse. `` You just do n't say no to a $ 150 billion-a-year industry,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, referring to First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s advice that youngsters `` just say no'' to drugs. `` If you want to fight a war you've got to have a budget,'' he said. Following his address, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met briefly with <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, also a Democrat, who has not endorsed a presidential candidate. `` We're very impressed with the ideas he's expressed for investing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, infrastructure investment programs and the war on drugs ...'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hershey </LOCATION> resident who attended the <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> rally, said he was impressed with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s concern for all residents. `` We have a chance to make history. Even if his nomination fails on the convention floor, we have made history,'' he said.

 Lawyers for both <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and the former congressman he sued for questioning his war record said they were pleased by an order that the former television evangelist pay $ 28,000 in court costs. Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Pete </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> was sued in 1986 after he claimed that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had used the political influence of his late father, Sen. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, D-Va., to avoid combat duty during the Korean War <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> dropped the lawsuit last month rather than go to trial on March 8, when he ran in <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries on Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> officially remains a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, although <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to amass sufficient delegates to clinch the nomination in today's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> dismissed the lawsuit on the condition that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> pay <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s court costs because the former congressman is the prevailing party. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> had sought $ 42,845 in court costs following the dismissal last month of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s $ 35 million libel action. But the clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here rejected $ 14,845 of that amount. `` We are pleased that even at the clerk level it was knocked down substantially from $ 42,000 down to $ 28,000,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leising </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s attorneys. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON>, said he was pleased with the award. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s lawyers, who had originally argued their client should only be assessed $ 6,000, have five days to file further objections with the judge. `` We will consider whether to seek a further reduction,'' <PERSON> Leising </PERSON> said, noting that `` at some point, the cost of legal fees in seeking a reduction might outweigh what we would get.'' The clerk disallowed more than $ 7,000 in fees for an expert witness <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> had hired to rebut <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s claims that he suffered economic hardship as a result of the statements, which were contained in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ind </LOCATION>. The letter was printed by several syndicated columnists, prompting the libel suit.

 A lawyer awarded $ 21 million for four years of confinement and torture in Argentine prisons during the military regime says he'll donate half the money to other victims of human abuses there. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> on Monday ordered former Argentine Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who supervised the prisons, to pay the money, described by plaintiff lawyers as a record for human rights abuse cases settled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, another federal judge is scheduled to decide whether <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> should be extradited to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> on charges of 43 murders and 24 kidnappings allegedly committed by soldiers under his command. `` It's a tremendous victory both for human rights and for the people of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the victims and the families of the disappeared, to whom a great portion of this award will be donated,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, an attorney for the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said of Monday's ruling. Cole's client, <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON>, a labor union lawyer and former government official in <LOCATION> Mendoza </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, said he was arrested in March 1976, six days after a military coup, held for four years and tortured repeatedly in military prisons overseen by <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. `` They laid me down on a table,'' <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, testified last month. `` They tied my arms and legs. They put electric shocks on my genitals and my gums, and they asked who were my friends.'' He also described beatings, freezing showers, death threats and solitary confinement in an unheated, windowless cell for days at a time. He said 90-minute torture sessions occurred about a month after he was arrested and repeated several times before his release in April 1980. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, whom prisoners referred to as `` the lord of death and life,'' intervened personally in 1977 to block <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON>'s release from prison, according to <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON> The judge on Monday held <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> in default after he failed to respond to the lawsuit. <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> awarded Martinez-Baca $ 1.17 million for lost income, $ 10 million for pain and suffering and $ 10 million as punitive damages. <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON> agreed to give half the award to a fund for victims of rights abuses in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said plaintiffs in two other pending civil suits in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that each seek $ 20 million against <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> have made the same agreement. The 64-year-old defendant has insisted he spent his last $ 100,000 on lawyers in his extradition case and has no money left. Lawyers for <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON>, however, doubted that. `` This is someone who is alleged to have taken many millions of dollars when he was in a position fo power in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' said attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeper </PERSON>. `` He paid his attorneys $ 100,000 in wire transfers from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and we're sure there's more where that came from.'' The damages can be collected against <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s assets anywhere in the world. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> commanded the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> from 1976 to 1979. He fled when a civilian government came to power in 1983 and was arrested in January 1987 at his home in <LOCATION> Foster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. An estimated 9,000 to 20,000 suspected leftist sympathizers vanished during the military regime from 1976 to 1983. Cole, whose non-profit legal organization has handled other human rights cases, said the highest previous award was $ 10.4 million in 1984 to relative of a youth who was tortured and murdered in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. The money was never paid because the defendant, a police chief, had no assests that could be collected.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is extending economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, over the objections of a group of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who say he should be helping the peace process rather than punishing Nicaraguans. The White House announced the move Monday, saying <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government still poses `` an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had not made the formal announcement of a one-year extention, with publication in the Federal Register, the sanctions he imposed in 1985 would have lapsed on May 1. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed an executive order on May 1, 1985, cutting off all trade with the Central American country, denying Nicaraguan airliners and flag vessels access to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and ending a 27-year U.S.-Nicaraguan friendship treaty. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited `` aggressive actions'' by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and its close military ties with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, however, has maintained diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, while supporting Contra forces trying to overthrow the government of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had been organizing an effort to lift the embargo, gathering signatures for a letter to the president. <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should `` stop punishing the Nicaraguan people and start pushing the peace process.'' `` The Nicaraguan embargo has worked against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests from the beginning,'' he said in a statement released by his office. He said it has discouraged the private sector in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, brought severe criticism from other Latin American and Western European countries, harmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business and labor interests `` and increased the suffering of innocent civilians in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> introduced legislation last week to lift the trade and other economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` If the Nicaraguan emergency were allowed to lapse,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s letter said, `` the present Nicaraguan trade controls would also lapse, impairing our government's ability to apply economic pressure on the Sandinista government and reducing the effectiveness of our support for the forces of the democratic opposition in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>House Approves Penalties for Genocide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House action has taken the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on its way to becoming a full participant in international agreements aimed at preventing genocide. By a voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday approved largely symbolic legislation setting stiff penalties for the crime of genocide. The legislation, which is backed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, must also be ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Although the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1948, it was not ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> until 1986. The international accords are aimed at preventing and punishing attempts to destroy, in whole or in major part, a national, ethnic, religious, racial or religious group. Since the convention itself contains no mechanism to punish violators, the nations which have signed and ratified it it are required to pass anti-genocide laws. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials contend that full implementation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the genocide convention will remove an international human rights embarrassment. A report on the bill issued by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> quoted Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position: `` Most of us will agree that genocide is not likely to take place within the borders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said. `` Our action on this convention is above all a symbolic act. `` It underlines our role of leadership in the free world on behalf of the cause of human rights.'' The bill sets prison sentences ranging from 20 years to life for people convicted of such offenses and sets fines of up to $ 1 milliion. It also provides for a prison term of up to five years and a fine of up to $ 500,000 for people convicted of inciting others to undertake acts of genocide. Those penalties would apply to crimes of genocide committed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nationals or which are committed within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The legislation also suspends the statute of limitations for prosecutions on allegations of genocide.

 When Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for his summit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he'll be keeping an eye on the results of a provincial election back home. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who arrives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tonight, is trying to decide soon when to call a federal election. The choice of a new government today in <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>, a blue-collar industrial province in central <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, may show the way. <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> has been controlled by the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for 15 of the past 19 years, but all polls indicate <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will win the election, after narrowly losing to the socialists in 1986. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has 16 months to go in his five-year term, but it is traditional for Canadian leaders to set an early election date when political omens are favorable. In a weekend interview, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said he wanted to clear his government's legislative agenda before calling a ballot. That agenda includes ratification of a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement negotiated with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, passage of the <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> constitutional accord recognizing <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> as a French-speaking `` distinct society,'' a child day care program and the privatization of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>. The FreeTrade Agreement will be discussed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected vote on it this summer, while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> will consider legislation on the agreement next month. Recently, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has been making campaign-like stops around the country to test the political waters. His 48-hour <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> visit includes a host of photo opportunities including a 19-gun salute at the White House and separate meetings with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and leaders of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday afternoon, he is to address both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A former lawyer and corporate executive from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, 49, has devoted much of his term to repairing Canada-U.S. relations strained under former <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>. Despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reluctance to clean up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> smokestack emissions causing acid rain north of the border, he and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> agree on key trade and defense issues. According to White House officials, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spends more time talking with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> on the telephone than any other world leader. Domestically, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has had a stormy time in office in spite of the 140-seat majority he won four years ago in the 282-member House of Commons. He has lost eight Cabinet members in scandals ranging from a defense minister who visited a German strip club to a transport minister tried for fraud. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has shepherded <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s economy to the fastest growth among major industrialized countries, with 4 percent inflation and unemployment at a 6 -LCB- - year low of 7.8 percent Now the Conservatives are now neck-and-neck in the polls with the Liberals and New Democrats. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> nevertheless has a credibility problem and is liked by only about one-third of the electorate, according to polls. In contrast, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> gets high marks as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s most admired politician. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> dubs his nemesis `` perfection personified.'' `` I do n't know if I'll ever close in on perfection,'' the prime minister said. `` But I do n't have to, to win an election.'' He said when the time comes, voters will not take a chance by electing what would be the country's first socialist government at a federal level. <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>'s vulnerable spot is his party's vow to pull <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> out of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance and to renegotiate the NORAD air defense pact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was a charter member of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and has 6,900 troops stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed in 1986 to renew the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> pact for five years, protecting the continent against Soviet attack over the North Pole. The New Democrats would bring the troops home and cancel <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s $ 6.5 billion plan to acquire <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s first fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. Aware of the unpopularity of its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> pledge, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> softened its stance this month by promising not to start the withdrawal in a first term. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> ridiculed the change, saying Canadians would never support `` a policy that says we're going to pull out of our most sovereign undertaking with regard to national defense, but by the way, we're not going to do it right now.''

 In the heat of the <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> day, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bodeguita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medio </ORGANIZATION> resembles the steamy cantinas of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with a bit of the Big Apple thrown in. Like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, the walls are covered with graffiti left by visitors who pack the cramped restaurant tucked along a side street of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. Like the cafes of <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, a sweating chef stirs metal tubs of pork and beans, swatting at an occasional fly and wiping his brow with a dishcloth. But there's a difference. Here, above the din of clattering plates and the strum of the strolling guitarist, you're as apt to hear German, Italian, French and English being spoken as you are to hear Spanish. It's a sound the government loves to hear. With its <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> climate and calm beaches, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, is a natural lure for tourists. Before the revolution, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visitors plunked down millions of dollars in the cabarets and casinos of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. The casinos are closed now and tourists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> vanished when relations soured between the two countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourists who spend money in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> are subject to prosecution under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trading with the Enemy Act. The communist island nation, largely dependent on Soviet aid and sugar exports, is making an all-out effort to bring in money from elsewhere. From the bustle of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> to the serene beaches of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the government is putting up new hotels and renovating old ones in hopes of making tourism its No. 2 earner of hard currency, after sugar, by the year 2000. Numbers are hard to come by _ nobody at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, Intur, would talk to an American reporter. But <PERSON> Intur </PERSON>'s vice president, <PERSON> Orosman </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, recently told Cuban reporters that in 1987, about 123,000 people from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> visited <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. That was an increase of 15 percent over 1986. According to the magazine <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>, Intur figures from 1986 indicate that 155,795 tourists visited <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, bringing in about $ 97.3 million. Before the revolution, tourism brought in about $ 400 million annually. The Canadian tourism season runs from December through the end of March. But a few could still be found lounging in the 85 degree sun last week at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> del Mar, a seaside resort 20 miles outside <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Adelaide </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aloi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> said they paid $ 1,000 each for two weeks in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, including breakfast and dinner in their hotel and round-trip airfare. Like others interviewed, they praised beaches, weather, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> hospitality and the feeling of security. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s cheap, but you have to bargain your way through it,'' said <PERSON> Aloi </PERSON>. `` Here, there's nobody coming up to you on the street trying to sell things or get money.'' But they agreed with other tourists who complained about bad hotel food, the poor quality of consumer goods and hotel service that is not up to par with other vacation spots. At the high-rise <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libre </LOCATION> in the capital, the plumbing was iffy and there was rarely hot water. It was n't unusual to wait 10 minutes for an elevator, and no one was there to offer assistance when the small refrigerator in one reporter's room started burning one night. `` I personally would n't come back because I like to shop, and there's nothing much to buy,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, interviewed at the <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantico </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>. `` But this is the place to come if you just want a nice, relaxing vacation.'' <PERSON> Intur </PERSON> says it is trying to improve things for tourists by renovating older hotels, such as the 30-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libre </ORGANIZATION>, and putting up new ones in areas such as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Varadero </LOCATION>, the island's most popular tourist spot. An airport is being built at <LOCATION> Varadero </LOCATION> so visitors wo n't have to drive the two hours north from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s airport, and 10 more hotels are scheduled for completion by 1990. In the capital, 11 hotels are under some form of renovation, according to the Intur magazine Sol de <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The Sun Channel, the television station for tourists, offers news, movies and a morning aerobics program in English and Spanish. Last week's feature films included `` Love at First Bite,'' `` A Man and a Woman,'' and `` Sahara.'' <PERSON> Intur </PERSON> also is offering prizes to lure foreigners. Sol de <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> heralded the arrival of a <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Proehl </PERSON>, the 100,000 th West German to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> over the past four years She won a free week in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> next year.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> presidential caucuses on Monday, overwhelming rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and capturing most of the state's 23 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. With 46 percent of the state's 75 legislative districts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 4,104 votes for 71 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1,080 or 19 percent, while 538 voters, or 9 percent, were uncommitted Based on these returns, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win 18 national convention delegates and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would win five. The combined votes for Democrats <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> totaled 1 percent. The percentage of votes determines how many of the state's 23 delegates each candidate receives. The delegates will not be elected until the state convention in June. Complete statewide returns were not expected until early Tuesday from the balloting in separate caucus meetings held in nearly all of the state's 1,807 voting districts. Although a victory here would reap only a handful of delegates, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said it would give the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor momentum heading into Tuesday's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. While Democrats declared their presidential preference, Republicans were attending their own caucus meetings to vote their preference for vice president and to say whether they want a western states regional primary similar to the South's Super Tuesday contests on March 8. Republicans had planned a non-binding presidential preference vote, but scrapped the idea after Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> virtually wrapped up the nomination. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> will send 28 delegates to the Democratic national convention, including five `` super delegates'' chosen as a result of present or past party office. Three of the superdelegates _ national committeewoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and state party chairman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Horiuchi </PERSON> _ have endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The other two are uncommitted. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also has the endorsement of <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>'s husband, former Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>. None of the candidates has visited <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> personally, but the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has maintained the strongest presence with a full-time staff. Support for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is more difficult to gauge. Two es here are picking up momentum. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will pick up some delegates,'' <PERSON> Horiuchi </PERSON> predicted. Traditionally between 8 percent and 12 percent of registered voters attend the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> caucuses.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> differed Monday over whether any concessions should be made to terrorists holding Americans hostage, while a new survey said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared headed for another big-state presidential primary victory in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` You never make concessions to terrorists _ ever,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters during a final campaign swing across the state before Tuesday's primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rejected what he called `` material concessions'' to terrorists but did not rule out political accommodation. He also said he could conceive of situations where he would grant safe passage to hostage-takers and added, `` I choose negotiation over blind bloody confrontation.'' `` If we are going to deter terrorism, we must address the underlying causes of terrorism,'' he said after an appearance at a high school in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` Terrorism does not emerge out of the blue.'' The candidates agreed that in hostage situations, the government ought to talk to people who could bring about the release of persons being held. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy holds that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials `` will talk to any official or group about the safety and release of hostages but we will not make concessions,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted, `` The fact is tha our government has talked with terrorists and has negotiated, in some instances successfully. It is good as a policy, but there must be always flexibility in the policy. ... We ought to take every initiative we can to gain the freedom of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' Eight Americans are held hostage by Moslem extremists in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The discussion of tactics for dealing with terrorists was an abrupt shift in a campaign debate which had been focused on economic issues, particularly how to assist <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s ailing steel industry. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wound up his <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> campaign in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> where he spoke to striking workers at a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> refinery, attended a reception with gay and lesbian activists and then held a get-out-the-vote rally. At the refinery, he said the company's profits were up 400 percent last year. `` For profits to be up and wages down is greedy and unfair,'' he said. He also linked the welfare of American workers to the status of blacks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Steelworkers in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> are in danger as long as ironworkers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are enslaved,'' he said. Referring to imprisoned South African black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` Until <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is free, you will not be free.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was aiming for his fourth straight primary victory in a contest with 178 delegates at stake. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who could clinch a convention majority with a victory in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, compared his campaign rebirth after an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus defeat to the revival of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, a once-strapped steel town. `` I know what it's like to be knocked to the canvas,'' he said, adding that his political comeback was `` a parallel to what you demonstrated here.'' The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 1,081 _ 58 short of the 1,139 needed for the nomination at the GOP convention next August. His only remaining rival, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, has 31 delegates. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was more than half way toward a delegate majority, holding 1,075.15 national convention votes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 836.1 while 599.75 were uncommitted. A tally of 2,081 or more is needed to win the nomination at the July convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strong victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary last week made him the prohibitive favorite to emerge as the Democratic presidential nominee. A new poll sponsored by <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> KYW-TV </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s KDKA-TV indicated a big <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win here, with the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor the choice of 57 percent of the likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters surveyed compared to 31 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, won a large majority of the 23 delegates at stake in caucuses Monday night in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. With 46 percent of the state's legislative districts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 71 percent of the vote to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 19 percent. The flap over how to deal with terrorists began on Sunday when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took issue with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position. `` I've raised the point in several debates this year,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` Every time a question comes up about terrorism, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says, ` I'm against terrorism. ... We should not negotiate with terrorists. ... In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, never negotiate with terrorists.' `` I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd do it.'' When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked Monday about the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> statement, he said, `` I think we need a tough anti-terrorist policy. `` I do n't have a problem with talking, but you never make concessions to terrorists _ ever. If you do, what you end up with is hostage-taking and terrorism all over the world.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that as president he would not talk directly to terrorists because `` it would effectively raise the status of the terrorists and that would be a stimulus and that should not happen.'' He went on to say that `` talk does not mean material concessions.'' He said, `` I would never, never exchange arms for hostages,'' a reference to the secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` That was a fundamental mistake.'' Asked what he meant by material concessions, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` Well, you're giving something physical. The first principle is that we should not jeopardize our national interests or national security.'' Pressed on whether he would exchange political prisoners for hostages, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` Well, the other government must make that judgment. They must weigh their political circumstances, they must determine the consequences of such an act. Every plea bargain situation or right of safe passage situation must be weighed on its own merits.'' Meanwhile, a Gallup poll released Monday evening had <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> virtually tied in a head-to-head race, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> doing better with the addition of Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> as a running mate and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a bit worse if he ran with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 45 percent support to 43 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with 12 percent undecided or favoring someone else. A Bush-Kemp ticket won the support of 50 percent, against 40 percent for a Dukakis-Jackson ticket, with 10 percent in the other-undecided category. With <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as the Democratic presidential nominee, the result was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 60 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 25, other-undecided 15. Gallup surveyed 1,204 registered voters April 21-23; the poll had a margin of sampling error of 3 points. Among the 540 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the poll, 66 percent favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the party's nominee to 22 percent who wanted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 12 percent other-undecided. About two-thirds of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support was strong, compared to one-third of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> will speed its <ORGANIZATION> DataStream </ORGANIZATION> news delivery service to about 9,000 words a minute and increase its domestic news staff to deal with what its president calls the `` the new world of news.'' The increase to 9,000 words a minute begins in June, and the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> also will offer new photo and graphic services, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> told publishers and newspaper editors Monday at the annual AP meeting. The news cooperative also will add 10 to 15 domestic news staffers in 1988 to better serve the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,423 newspaper members, he said. `` The bulk of these will go to our line bureaus, whose state and regional news coverage is so important to you,'' he told the members. `` With membership increasing as it has, the demands on our state bureaus are increasing. And we must meet those needs.'' The worldwide news cooperative is about to move from a speed of about 1,050 words a minute to about 9,000 on its <ORGANIZATION> DataStream </ORGANIZATION> and DataFeature wires. <ORGANIZATION> DataStream </ORGANIZATION> is the AP high-speed news wire. DataFeature is a separate service that delivers supplemental and syndicate copy to member newspapers throughout the system. For newspapers with systems that need slower speeds, the delivery can be reduced, but the higher capacity will avoid crowding that can slow the delivery of copy, much like traffic clogs a highway. `` We are raising the speed limit from 55 miles per hour to 440 miles per hour, and, if that were n't enough, we're widening the AP interstate from four lanes to eight,'' <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said. A new AP electronic darkroom for large newspapers already is serving three members. In June the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> will unveil a PC-based electronic darkroom designed for smaller newspapers, <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said. After the meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> held its annual luncheon with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> as the keynote speaker. <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>, 57, is the founder of <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and financed the rescue of two of his employees who were held hostage in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1978. The luncheon was held on the first day of the three-day 102nd Annual Convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The financier and philanthropist told the more than 1,500 people at the luncheon that business leaders, not politicians, hold much of the blame for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' declining status in the world. Since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy depends on tax-paying workers, business leaders should work harder to create more jobs, <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> said other countries, especially in the <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region, are outpacing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in education, trade and technology. He said that before the federal government can cure the huge budget deficit, individual Americans must learn not to spend more than they earn. `` The greatest nation in the history of civilization has given up trying to live within its means,'' he said. `` We and not the elected officials are the dwarfs and the wimps.'' Before the luncheon, five <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> correspondents shared their experiences in a panel discussion called `` The World's Hotspots: A Firsthand View.'' Also at the meeting, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> of The -LRB- <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -RRB- Star-Ledger, and <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON> of The Christian Science Monitor were elected to the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, and four incumbent directors were re-elected. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottaway </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Record </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> of The Tribune of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heminger </PERSON> of The Courier in Findlay, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were elected to new three-year terms on the board. Directors were elected from among 12 nominees at the AP annual meeting. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> and Ms. Fanning were chosen to succeed retiring directors <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Daily Mail and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marbut </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- Caller-Times, who had served the maximum of three three-year terms on the board. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> is president of The Star-Ledger, and of <ORGANIZATION> Advance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He is a director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. Fanning is editor of the Monitor, published in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and is immediate past president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>. The voting for directors was based on membership bonds held by the newspapers that make up the cooperative news agency. <PERSON> Heminger </PERSON> was re-elected to the board to represent a city of under 50,000 population. AP bylaws require that there be at least three directors representing newspapers published in cities of less than 50,000 population.

Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 124.57 yen, 0.43 yen lower than Monday's close of 125. It opened at 124.65 yen and traded in a narrow range of 124.55 yen to 124.70 yen, traders said. Analysts said initial bullish sentiment in the stock market following the record close on Monday pushed stock prices up in early trading, but the trend slowly reversed, fueled by profit-taking. `` The market started out on a bullish note, but then ran out of gas and started moving down,'' said a trader at a major securities firm, who asked not to be identified.

 A 5-year-old boy has realized his dream of attending school before he dies of AIDS. He began his first day of preschool by telling his classmates about his fatal disease and his `` bad blood.'' The boy, whose breathing is aided by an oxygen tank, surprised his mother by volunteering the information as his seven classmates introduced themselves, his mother said Monday. `` He said ` This is my oxygen, and I have a disease. My bad blood could kill you,''' said the mother, <PERSON> Shiela </PERSON>, who took her son <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> on Monday to the special education class at <ORGANIZATION> Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` He did n't wait for anything. And the kids responded really well,'' the mother said at a news conference outside her condominium in this <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb. `` He broke the ice right off and from then on it was just normal kid stuff,'' said <PERSON> Shiela </PERSON>, a divorced mother of three other sons. She has asked that her last name not be published because she fears retaliation against her family. `` They listened and they played with me,'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> said of the hour he spent in the classroom. Asked whether his first day was as much fun as he expected, he replied, `` Yeah.'' <PERSON> Shiela </PERSON> said her son's biggest dream has been to attend school before he dies. `` He used to talk about dying all the time and he said he wanted to die,'' she said as <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> watched ants inching along the sidewalk. `` But he has n't addressed it since he found out he would get to go to school. He has n't mentioned it in the last couple of weeks.'' As his mother talked with reporters, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> showed off a <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> picture of himself at school. At one point, he walked away to play on the sidewalk, unhooking the tube that connected him with the oxygen tank. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>'s hopes of going to school were blocked several times in the past year by one delay after another. Earlier this month, a tutor assigned by the school district to teach him at home demanded to be reassigned, threatening to file a lawsuit if forced to continue the tutoring. The request was granted. School officials decided April 19 to allow <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> to attend class. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s first recorded child victim of the fatal disease, said his mother. The youngster contracted AIDS from tainted blood he received in a transfusion shortly after birth and was diagnosed in June 1985. `` One thing that sticks in my mind, he used to say ` Jesus does n't listen to me. ... I told Him to come and get me, and He did n't.' It really rips your heart out, but I think in a way he's comforting me by telling me it's all right with him He was diagnosed three years ago, and it's just a matter of time.'' <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, executive director of exceptional students' services for <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, also attended the news conference and said she was unaware of any parents who had kept their children at home because of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>. There were no protesters or parents outside the school Monday. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said parents of the other students had prepared their children. `` We have met with the parents a couple of times,'' she said. `` It's basically a health and hygiene type of issue with them.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> eventually will attend class 10 hours a week and his progress will be evaluated in May and in August. <PERSON> Shiela </PERSON> also plans to enroll <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> in summer classes. `` He has such a limited time in school.''

 News coverage of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is more difficult now because there is more activity and thus more news to report, according to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Putzel </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau chief in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Now we cover dissident news conferences, official news conferences, and demonstrations,'' he said. `` We are getting a lot more information. `` For Soviet reporters, it's a whole new ballgame,'' <PERSON> Putzel </PERSON> said. `` They now have to firgure out what's expected of them and how far they can and want to go.'' <PERSON> Putzel </PERSON> and four other <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> correspondents and news executives discussed reporting conditions and press freedoms, among other topics, during a conversation with <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> at The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting here Monday. The press is one of the most distinct areas of liberalization in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfrew </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> chief of bureau in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` The press is able to moderately criticize the government now,'' he said. `` There has been a change from direct intimidation to more subtle influence,'' he said. `` Current riots in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have posed difficult problems for the Israeli government, which is a democracy and prides itself on being one,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatro </PERSON>, the wire service's bureau chief in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The government has not used military censorship but has tried to close off stories by putting curfews on towns or declaring military areas closed, he said. <PERSON> Bryna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, noted the reopening of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, last fall. `` La Prensa has published consistently since October except for a brief week at Easter when they ran out of newsprint,'' she said. `` It is a very strong opposition newspaper.'' <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s chief <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent, said he has the same difficulties in getting access to people he needs to talk with as the foreign correspondents do. `` We only have access to our own booth and to -LRB- White House Press Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s office, where the door is usually closed,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't get to the oval office, or -LRB- White House Chief of Staff -RRB- <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s office or the senior staff without an appointment,'' he said. `` It's almost impossible on a spot story to get a call through for comment,'' he said. `` We have better luck talking to people on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> because -LRB- the -RRB- White House staff briefs congressional leaders on major issues.''

 A school bus went careening out of control after the driver suffered a fatal heart attack, but three junior high school boys brought it to a halt after seeing the driver topple from her seat. `` They are heroes,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, principal at <ORGANIZATION> Ralph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The full-size bus was carrying five youngsters to the school Monday morning, threading through traffic on busy Route 111 at 15 mph, authorities said. It narrowly missed a car and a utility pole when it veered left into oncoming traffic after the driver's heart attack. `` We heard something fall. I looked out the window and saw the bus heading for a car. I did n't know what happened,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Florival </PERSON>, 14, one of the boys who took over when driver <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Flammer </PERSON>, 48, of <PERSON> Holbrook </PERSON>, toppled from her seat. <PERSON> Florival </PERSON> and two 15-year-olds, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, ran forward from their seats in the rear. `` I grabbed the wheel,'' said <PERSON> Florival </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> slammed on the brakes.''

<HEAD>AIDS Issue Surfaces During Discussion On U.S. Bases In Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino negotiators today discussed AIDS and procedures for trying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops in criminal cases. The discussion occurred during talks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases which sources described as difficult and emotional. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is debating a bill to ban nuclear weapons in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and to prohibit nuclear-capable military ships from making port calls. The measure is directed at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. In another development, at least seven people were killed today on <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> island during a gun battle between government troops and <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> who deserted their unit. Three of the dead were <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> and four were government soldiers, officials said. Radio stations said a civilian also died. Also today, officials said communist rebels were suspected in the killings of a police captain and an anti-communist vigilante in two separate attacks near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base. After their discussion today, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino negotiators released a joint statement saying they had discussed `` the criminal jurisdiction issue'' and that the Philippine side presented its proposal on purchases of locally manufactured products `` and socio-economic issues.'' There was no elaboration, but sources familiar with the talks said the `` socio-economic issues'' referred to allegations that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops had brought the deadly AIDS virus into the country. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks were `` difficult'' and `` emotional.'' At least 50 Filipino prostitutes have been found carrying the AIDS virus but none has developed symptoms of the disease, which is transmitted primarily through sexual intercourse or contaminated needles and blood products. Most of those found with the virus work in bars near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have promised not to transfer troops carrying the virus to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Filipino officials have suggested that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> finance health and rehabilitation programs for AIDS-infected prostitutes working near the bases. The current bases agreement exempts American servicemen from trial by Filipino courts if they allegedly commit crimes while on duty. Sources said Filipino negotiators believe <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> commanders issue duty certificates to their troops too freely in a bid to exempt them from trial by local courts. On April 5, the two sides began a periodic review of the 1947 agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains six military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The outcome is expected to influence <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s decision whether to allow the bases to remain after their lease expires in 1991. But the talks are taking place amid growing calls for closing the bases, which many Filipinos see as a vestige of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colonial rule. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has promised to honor the agreement but refuses to say whether she will support an extension. Under the new Filipino constitution, any extension must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began debate on a bill to ban nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered ships from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say about 40 percent of the warships that call at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> are nuclear powered. The bill's sponsors say it is directed at the American bases. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials refuse to say whether nuclear weapons are stored in the <LOCATION> Phillipines </LOCATION>. Officials said the battle between government troops and <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> began when the rangers attacked a checkpoint set up to prevent them from moving from their hideout. About 30 members of the army's elite <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> deserted in 1986 and moved to <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION>, a small island where <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s international airport is located The renegade rangers, who the military claims have been involved in smuggling, formed a religious cult that forbids bathing and cutting hair. In the <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> incidents, police said two men armed with .45 - caliber pistols shot and killed <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, 41, deputy police commander of <LOCATION> Mabalacat </LOCATION>, as he drove late Monday near the base. Hours later, a lone gunman killed <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabile </PERSON>, 48, while he played cards with friends in <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sabile </PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Angelino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simbulan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-communist vigilante group. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON>, a sprawling military facility 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, straddles the towns of <LOCATION> Mabalacat </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In October rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extraction in attacks outside the base.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Housen </PERSON> were looking for someplace peaceful to spend their retirement when they moved to this rural southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> community two years ago from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Instead, they find themselves fighting to keep a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rapist who cut off the forearms of his victim from becoming their neighbor. `` Unless you've got a gun or a large dog, you're very vulnerable,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Housen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, as she petted her Doberman. `` We have a gun and a good watchdog.'' The object of their fear is <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. The 60-year-old former merchant marine became a free man Monday after serving eight years in prison and one year of parole for raping and mutilating a 15-year-old girl he picked up hitchhiking in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, then leaving her for dead outside <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>. Though his whereabouts remain unknown since his release, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> has said he wants to visit relatives in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, then come to <LOCATION> Azalea </LOCATION> to live with members of a fundamentalist communal sect called the Bride of Christ. Angry protests followed <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> from town to town last year when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials tried to place him on parole. He was finally put in a small trailer on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison to complete his parole. Bride of Christ leader Pastor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> a home in this tiny rural community of about 750 people, mostly millworkers, loggers, retirees and some ranchers. Since then, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says he and his followers have received death threats and shots have been fired at their homes. `` I would like to see them hug each other,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> and his victim, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, who has been reported living somewhere in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` It takes two people to heal a situation. `` I know in this environment where we live -LRB- <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> -RRB- will have an opportunity to see love,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> added. `` Maybe he has never seen it. I know I did n't until I got saved.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was convicted of sexually abusing one of his daughters in 1965, and has been a controversial figure in <LOCATION> Azalea </LOCATION> since he and his 60 followers moved here four years ago from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> `` This is n't your little white church,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Housen </PERSON> said. `` Nobody in this community belongs to that church. It's a closed church.'' Though the state attorney general's office says it can do nothing to stop <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> from moving to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Ore., sent a letter this week to residents here, urging them to attend a meeting Saturday in the Grange hall <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is the sponsor of a state initiative to keep repeat offenders in prison for their full terms. `` The reason he chose your town, no doubt, has a lot to do with how attractive <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> is to career criminals,'' the congressman wrote. Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Housen </PERSON> said she is particularly afraid for <PERSON> Azalea </PERSON>'s children `` The man obviously has to live somewhere, but geographically, this is n't the place,'' she said, pointing to the thick forests surrounding the community. `` I know people who live in this area and they have children who get off the school bus and walk a mile through these woods.'' Minister <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the children in his church are eager to meet <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. `` In our church we do n't teach fear to our children,'' he said. `` We want to show him love.'' The tension has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to increase patrols through <LOCATION> Azalea </LOCATION>. `` Even if <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> did not show, that would not belay the feelings down there toward <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> for making this invitation to start with,'' said Undersheriff <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. `` That one will be a long time going away, if it ever does.''

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia To Sign Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> today decided to sign an international treaty limiting the spread of nuclear arms, apparently responding to Israeli fears that the kingdom might arm its missiles with nuclear warheads. Information Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Shaer </PERSON> said the decision was made during a Cabinet meeting in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riyahd </LOCATION> where other issues also were discussed, the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It appeared the announcement was designed primarily to reassure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> will not try to put nuclear warheads on CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles the kingdom acquired from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> wrote President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recently reportedly assuring him that the warheads on the surface-to-surface missiles are not nuclear. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has alleged that the missiles constitute a threat to its safety and indicated it might deal a preemptive strike to destroy them. The news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, said Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> foreign minister, recommended that the kingdom join the International Nuclear Weapons Non-proliferation Treaty. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest exporter of crude oil, was reported to have obtained from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> an undisclosed number of CSS-2 missiles capable of reaching virtually any point in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Western diplomatic sources have said that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which arms its own CSS-2s with atomic warheads, has told <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> it will not export nuclear arms. The sources said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> refused a request by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to inspect the missiles, which they said were deployed in the <LOCATION> Rub </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Khali </LOCATION> desert south of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. Saudi sources said <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, the defense minister, approached <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the CSS-2s mainly because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional obstruction of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approval of the sale of certain types of weapons to the kingdom. They complained that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been bending to powerful Israeli lobbying against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sale to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The Saudis feel threatened by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which in 1984 began using intermediate-range missiles against its <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war foe, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Saudi-Iranian relations hit their lowest point in July, when hundreds of Iranian pilgrims tried to defy a ban on political rallies and were killed in clashes with Saudi riot police in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> during the annual pilgrimage season. Gulf-based Arab diplomatic sources have said the Saudis want the CSS-2s as a potential deterrent to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, whose leadership has urged the overthrow of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> royal family. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were the major signers when the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was adopted in 1968. In subsequent years the treaty was signed by scores of other nations. The treaty is aimed at restricting the spread of military nuclear technology. It calls for nuclear powers to abstain from assisting non-nuclear nations in obtaining or making nuclear weapons.

<HEAD>Garry Trudeau Tells Publishers Of Growing Intolerance Of Free

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cartoonist <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> told a convention of newspaper publishers he does not object to newspapers editing his often controversial `` Doonesbury'' strip. But, he added, the country seems more intolerant of free expression than three years ago. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s strip runs in about 900 newspapers. He won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1975, becoming the first comic-strip artist ever to do so. Editors have the right and the responsibility to cut material they think is inappropriate for their readership, he said Monday. `` As you know, it's called editing, and those who call it censorship are either careless or ignorant,'' <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> told about 2,000 people attending the 102nd Annual Convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But he said those who use the rationale that `` Doonesbury'' is biased and unfair as the reason for pulling the strip are missing the point. `` Satire is supposed to be unbalanced. It's supposed to be unfair,'' he said. `` Criticizing a political satirist for being unfair is like criticizing a 260-pound noseguard for being physical. `` We're all up against a very dangerous trend of intolerance towards free expression,'' he said. `` Indeed, if `` Doonesbury'' has sometimes seemed too pungent to some of you, it may be because it appeared in an environment unfriendly to critical comment, a time when impertinent questions are unwelcome.'' Before <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> and president of the Concord -LRB- <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> -RRB- Monitor, delivered the first keynote address of the three-day convention. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the industry needs to be more vigorous in its hiring of minority journalists. `` Our staffs must reflect the diversity of our society and our newspapers must faithfully mirror the world around us because we are a unique business with extraordinary responsibilities,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Besides staff diversity and editorial excellence, the future of the industry depends on technological research and development, he said. `` Either technological developments will catch us unprepared _ and we can pray others are similarly surprised _ or we can stimulate and shape technological developments to serve our needs,'' he said. The convention's first panel discussion featured trade experts who touched upon, among other things, the omnibus trade bill before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the effect of foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The bill, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has promised to veto, could be revised easily to his liking with its major provisions intact, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebeler </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think you're a bit premature in calling in the undertaker,'' she told fellow panelists discussing the bill. The bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 312-107 last week and is to be voted on by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> especially objects to a provision requiring most manufacturers to give 60 days notice of plant closings and major layoffs. <PERSON> Liebeler </PERSON> said she thought that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the bill and that, in a revised version, the notification provision would be dropped and the bill approved. More than 2,000 people, including about 1,500 publishers who represent 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are attending the convention. Today's activities feature a panel discussion on the status of minority journalists and a speech by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Eastside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Senior <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> is to give a luncheon address. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> will conduct its annual business meeting, including the election of its officers and directors.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stock Market Closes At Record High; Dollar Falls Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market had a record high closing today for the third consecutive day, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar inched down against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the market's main index, reached the all time high of 27,339.14 points immediately after Tuesday's opening at 27,323.54. Then profit-taking thwarted the early morning rally causing share prices dip at the close of the morning session. Bullish sentiment in the market, however, drove the shares back up to the day's opening level immediately after the start of the afternoon session, and the market closed the day's trading at 27,246.77, or 33.32 points higher than Monday's close, another record high. `` It was a typical first-day-of-the-month pattern,'' said a trader for a Japanese securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Major securities firms customerily push their sales on the first day of the month,'' he added. `` So share prices usually jump up in early morning and then profit-taking usually press it down a bit.'' Shares traded Tuesday will go into the May account. The trader added that the general trend is still upward, but investors took `` wait-and-see attitude'' Tuesday ahead of the release of gross national product figures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first quarter of 1988. This made the recovery of share prices slower than usual. The American gross national product figures will be announced today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Volume traded in the first section today was estimated at 1 billion shares. Meanwhile, the dollar opened at 124.65 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and closed at 124.57 yen, down 0.35 yen from Monday's close. It traded in a narrow range of 124.55 yen to 124.70 yen throughout the day. `` The dollar sold in the 125's Monday, so it went back to a comfortable level at around 124.60 yen. Now, it can not seem to be able to go anywhere from there unless some influencing factors emerge,'' said <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukuzawa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this point, 124.55 - 124.70 yen seems to be the neutral range.'' <PERSON> Shukuzawa </PERSON>, a currency dealer at one of the largest bank in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, added that he expects no major effects from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures on exchange rates in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` GNP is not like a trade figure that has immediate effects on exchange rates,'' he said. `` Its effects show up in a much longer term.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> today praised a court for sentencing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to death for Nazi war crimes. `` All of us are proud that a Jewish tribunal in the Jewish state has judged and condemned one of the cruelest war criminals who murdered many of our Jewish brethren and relatives,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech at a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> hotel. The Polish-born <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> lost relatives in the Holocaust. Also today, an official at the prison where <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was held said guards were ordered to watch the former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker to prevent him from committing suicide. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the precautions were `` crazy.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, was returned to his solitary confinement cell in the maximum-security Ayalon Prison near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on Monday after receiving the death penalty for sending hundreds of thousands of Jews to their deaths in World War II as a brutal <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> guard called `` Ivan the Terrible.'' Since returning to prison, he has been placed `` under 24-hour guard, and we are asking his guards to be more careful, more alert,'' said <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tester </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to be prepared.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the prison's precautions had `` no basis in fact. It's crazy. They're going to pop up with that kind of stupid propaganda to try to make it seem he's showed signs he's going to kill himself out of remorse or guilt.'' `` My father would never attempt something like that because he's innocent and he'll fight this to the last minute I've visited my dad and I know what frame of mind he's in,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. The Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> has insisted he is a victim of mistaken identity and plans to appeal his conviction to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 22, said the defense would not file an appeal for several weeks, until after the family returns home to map out an appeal strategy. He also said the family would hire a new lawyer to help prepare the appeal in addition to the current defense team of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON>. According to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law, a conviction with a death sentence must be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The last person to be executed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war criminal <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, who was hanged in 1962. Israeli court officials have said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> would likely be hanged if his conviction is upheld on appeal. <PERSON> Tester </PERSON> said there were no gallows in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that `` if the appeal is denied, we will have to build one.'' Some Israelis saw the 14-month trial as a crucial opportunity to educate the younger generation and remind the world of the horrors of the Holocaust. `` The personal fate of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is n't important or very interesting,'' <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commentator and Holocaust survivor, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` The importance of the trial ... was to remind us of the Holocaust. For most of humanity the Holocaust is cloudy history.'' But comparing <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s trial with proceedings against <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON> 26 years ago, <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON> said: `` The <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON> trial was a national catharsis for Israelis, the <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> trial leaves us in depression.'' `` The banality -LRB- of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> -RRB- is more frightening than any evil,'' <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON> said. `` If this guy could be like that, then there are millions more like him.''

 A woman accused of killing her husband and another person discussed killing him with drug overdoses months before he died from cyanide-tainted aspirin, her daughter testified at the product-tampering trial. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 28, told a federal court jury Monday that a `` discontented'' <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> briefly mentioned divorcing <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> but `` she said she was not going to lose half of everything she had fought so hard to get. `` Based on what my mother had told me prior to my dad's death, I believed that she did it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said in a packed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court courtroom. Her testimony was to continue today in the trial, now in its second week. On Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said her mother had questioned her about such drugs as heroin, cocaine and amphetamines; where they could be obtained and how much would cause an overdose. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> asked Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> whether her mother ever discussed specific people in the conversations. `` My dad, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>,'' she replied, referring to her stepfather. Prosecutors say Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, the first person in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be tried on charges of causing death by tampering with over-the-counter capsules, plotted to kill <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> to collect insurance. But prosecutors said the plot unraveled when Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> challenged her mother's attempt to make his June 1986 death and that of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> a few weeks later look like random murders. Prosecutors have suggested there were no links between the victims other than the way they died. Government investigators also found Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s fingerprints in library books about poisons and that at least one insurance policy had been forged, prosecutors say. `` She was very discontent with him,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` She was grateful he stopped drinking ... but she was discontent they never did anything.'' <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was a reformed alcoholic, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> spoke softly but occasionally was choked by tears. She never looked at her mother; Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> rarely took her eyes from her daughter. When Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> told her daughter in June 1986 that <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was dead, `` She looked at me and said, ` I know what you are thinking and the answer's no,''' Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> testified. Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> failed to reveal her suspicions to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in interviews shortly after the deaths, saying she was `` scared for her and I guess to protect her.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> finally went to officials in January 1987. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> is charged in the deaths of <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and of Ms. Snow, 40, who died after ingesting poisoned capsules of Extra-Strength Excedrin. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> also faces three counts of tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two Extra-Strength Excedrin bottles and an Anacin-3 bottle recovered from stores in two <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburbs. The defense earlier challenged Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s credibility, saying she had a history of drug abuse and was motivated to contact the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> by a $ 300,000 reward established by a pharmaceutical group. A niece, <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, testified earlier Monday that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> `` seemed irked at everything'' a month before the cyanide deaths but never mentioned harming her husband. Asked whether Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had indicated an intent to kill, Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> replied, `` Absolutely not. Not ever.'' Prosecutors say the <PERSON> Nickells </PERSON>' marriage was unhappy, and that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was determined not to lose her trailer home in a divorce. Witnesses have testified that the <PERSON> Nickells </PERSON> were several thousand dollars in debt when <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> died.

 South Koreans expressed hope that today's legislative elections would help promote democracy, but many also said violent protests could result if widespread vote fraud occurs. `` A lot of problems have surfaced but from a long-term point of view, I think the elections would be a step forward toward democracy,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Soon-im </PERSON>, 43, a housewife in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said. Many voters interviewed shared that view but expressed concern that `` widespread corruption'' would heighten political instability before the Olympic Games, opening Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` I am afraid the elections would cause new problems rather than solve them,'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Han-ik </PERSON>, 21, a college student, said. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> and many others predicted a flood of lawsuits disputing results of this election, which follows the first direct presidential election in 16 years. In the presidential voting in December, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won with 36 percent of the vote. But opposition charges of rigging in that election won little support from the public, irritated by the opposition's inability to unite. Violence, corrupt campaigning and the alleged use of government influence to help governing party candidates became issues again in this campaign. Since the official 18-day campaign began, no day passed without reports of scuffles among rival party supporters, firebomb attacks on candidates or party offices and other violence. Scores were injured, although exact figures were not available, and 150 people were reported detained by police. Many people interviewed said they were most concerned by reports of widespread efforts to buy votes with meals, gifts and cash. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced it was expelling one candidate after authorities reported finding thousands of envelopes, each stuffed with the equivalent of $ 30 in cash, ready for mailing at a post office. `` I did not receive cash but got a case of soap,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-kil </PERSON>, 34, a taxidriver said. `` People say that only fools would not get gifts. In that sense, I am not a fool.'' A housewife in a relatively wealthy residential area in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said it was difficult to reject offers of free lunches or dinners, made through personal friends associated with certain candidates. `` I had received at least 10 offers of free sumptuous meals. I have a guilty feeling for not voting for any of the candidates who provided the meals,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has eased its `` anti-ugly'' law _ an ordinance aimed at eliminating suburban eyesores _ and will allow residents to air their dirty laundry in public, provided it's not in the front yard. The council on Monday scrapped some provisions of the new law and changed others, bowing to citizen complaints about the ordinance. Among other things, it altered the law to make it enforceable upon citizen complaint and not merely at the whim of someone in City Hall. Laundry still ca n't be aired in the front yard, but is permissible in side yards and on porches and balconies. The council in this <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area community also eliminated its ban on garbage cans in side yards. The revised law contains most of its original provisions intended to rid neighborhoods of discarded furniture, automobile bodies and other unsightly junk. It bans graffiti, dirt piles, overgrown vegetation or other debris on residential and non-residential property, if such messes can be seen from the street. Violators face fines up to $ 500, and those convicted of breaking the law more than three times within a year could face both a fine and a jail sentence.

 The government today celebrated the 10th anniversary of its socialist revolution with a Soviet-style parade of workers, soldiers and military hardware. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> led dozens of Afghan officials and a little-known <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation atop a reviewing stand for the morning procession. The parade followed a night of unusually heavy rifle fire and a rebel rocket blast in the eastern hills. On Monday, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> proposed a withdrawal of government soldiers from the posts near the Pakistani border to create `` a non-military line'' between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Afghan troops would leave its positions if anti-government guerrillas and Pakistani troops do the same. The proposal appeared to be little more than a face-saving admission of the difficulties the Afghan army is having against onslaughts by anti-communist insurgents, based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and supplied with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> weapons. At the parade, Afghan government troops bearing Soviet-supplied rifles marched past the leadership and about 500 dignitaries under striped awnings erected to protect them from the strong sun. Reflecting the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s recent attempts to cut a lower profile in Afghan government affairs, the senior Soviet in attendance was <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s parliamentary body, and even <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> journalists could not identify the two or three other <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> envoys who stood with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on the reviewing stand. Six bodyguards with <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> machine guns stood watch around <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, Defense Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Keshmandt </PERSON> and other Afghan officials. No disturbances took place during the two-hour parade. An <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> official confirmed today that a rocket fired by insurgents opposed to the Soviet-backed government had landed in the city but said he did not know details of damage or whether the blast had caused casualties. `` It was especially noisy last night, perhaps because they -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- wanted to say something about the holiday,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The celebration was reminiscent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s May Day and Revolution Day parades, in which hundreds of thousands of Soviets trek past the leadership assembled at Red Square. It was in April 1978 that Marxists inspired and armed by Soviet advisers staged a coup and killed President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>. The revolution sparked a widespread insurgency, plunging the nation into a civil war and driving an estimated 5 million Afghans into neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Soviet troops and tanks moved in to assist the embattled <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> leadership in December 1979, replacing one pro-Soviet government with another. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> became leader in May 1986, succeeding <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>, who is believed to be taking refuge in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now. An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> but they will begin leaving May 15 under a U.N.-mediated peace accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 15 by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and several other countries have been aiding the Afghan guerrillas via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> arms the Afghan military forces. Each superpower has reserved the right to continue its assistance as long as the other one does. The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord, have vowed to continue fighting until <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government is overthrown. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Monday, a nine-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring team arrived for preparations to monitor the implementation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. Under the pact, a 50-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer force will monitor the agreement with headquarters in the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>.

 A university student whose African gray parrot died after warning him of a kitchen fire will get another bird, courtesy of a sympathetic couple that breeds parrots as a hobby. `` I feel sorry for the guy,'' said <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arvada </LOCATION> who, with her husband, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, agreed to replace the parrot. `` I know how it feels to lose a pet.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' 7-year-old parrot, Coco, died Saturday morning from fumes from a burning Teflon-coated pot. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' roommate had fallen asleep after leaving a pot of boiling water on the stove.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell in early European trading as foreign currency dealers waited for the release in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later today of first quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figures.

 The city overwhelmingly has rejected a request by a group of military veterans to deny actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> an official welcome when she arrives here to film a movie. The Board of Aldermen on Monday voted 11-2, with two abstentions, to defeat the resolution offered by <PERSON> Gaetano </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, a retired major general of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the 300 people watching the vote applauded the final tally. Twenty-three speakers pleaded with the board to reject the resolution. Only three offered testimony in support of it. The proposed resolution, backed by a group of veterans bitter over the movie star's 1972 trip to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> in which she was photographed on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun, stated the city would not extend <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> any official welcome, `` symbolic or otherwise.'' <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> spoke against the resolution, saying residents appeared to be forgetting `` our basic laws and privileges that goes with them.

<HEAD>After Wreath Laying, Soviets Greeted With Music And Cheering</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Strains of bluegrass music and cheerleaders' chants of `` go Soviets, go'' filled the air as a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation and 150 Americans commemorated the linkup of Soviet and American troops in World War II. To greet three retired Soviet military officers, all veterans of the linkup of the two armies at the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on April 25, 1945, junior high school cheerleaders yelled `` Let's go, red and gold, go Soviets, go Soviets, big and bold!'' Two dozen schoolchildren sang `` Let There Be Peace on Earth.'' The Soviets exchanged hugs and handshakes during the ceremony Monday with four American World War II veterans from <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. Earlier in the day, the three-member Soviet delegation laid a wreath at the grave of <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, to honor the leader of Allied forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during the war. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, a retired lieutenant general and the head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation, said the former president is well remembered in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The meeting of Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops at the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> signaled an end to the war. <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> committed suicide three days later, and the Germans surrendered on May 7, 1945.

 <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> says she would consider appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry's television show to help raise money, and says she wants the financially troubled ministry to survive. `` People probably think I'm so anti-PTL.

It's not -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder -RRB- <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s dream. God gave him the dream. ...

Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> is the former church secretary whose sexual encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> led to his downfall.

<HEAD>Diplomats: Soviets Withdrawing From Eastern Afghanistan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet forces are beginning to withdraw from eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where anti-communist guerrillas have taken several posts since the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord was signed, Western diplomatic sources said today. The sources, speaking in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> also has begun transporting wrecked vehicles back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, apparently to prevent them from being salvaged by the insurgents. Under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement signed April 14, the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops are to start leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. Diplomats, quoting reports from their <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> missions, said evidence of the impending pullout is seen in heavy Soviet air traffic in and out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport and the movement of massive Soviet convoys near the capital. One source quoted an unidentified Soviet diplomat in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as saying Soviet troops are being `` consolidated'' in <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paktika </LOCATION> provinces, all of which border <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist president, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, also offered on Monday to withdraw his own troops from posts near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. He told three small parties loyal to his government that creation of `` a non-military line'' was contingent on agreement with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the guerrillas. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the insurgents are based, is a conduit for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the guerrillas. It also houses 3 million refugees of the civil war. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in late 1979 when they replaced one Marxist government with another. Diplomatic sources said the Soviets are resupplying the Afghan army as they prepare to hand the war over to them. However, government troops are reported to have fled several posts in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the past 10 days, including a strategic garrison at <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border in northeastern <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> province. The insurgents also reportedly have overrun six Soviet and Afghan posts in <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> province, just south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> in the southeast. Western diplomats disagree on the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government's ability to survive once the Soviets leave. Some diplomats say the insurgents recent successes in the east signalled the beginning of the end of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. Others predict that heavy fortifications in the capital might keep it secure after the Soviet pullout.

<HEAD>Russian Church To Get Bones Of English King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A High Court judge ruled that the bones of a 10th century English king can be transferred to a Russian exiles' church near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Deputy Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> decided Monday that the fragmented, 1,000-year-old bones of the young <PERSON> Saxon </PERSON> monarch, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> the Martyr, can be moved to the Russian Orthodox Church community at <LOCATION> Brookwood </LOCATION>. The bones are now in a box in a bank vault, and the judge said they can be transferred when the church, converted from an Anglican cemetery chapel, has been officially approved as a secure place. `` It's an answer to prayer,'' said the Very Rev. <PERSON> Archimandrite </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON>, head of the Orthodox community at <LOCATION> Brookwood </LOCATION>. The community has been looking for saintly relics for its church, which it renamed St. Edward the Martyr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, King of <ORGANIZATION> Wessex </ORGANIZATION>, ruled for three years and was only 16 or 17 when he was stabbed to death in <LOCATION> Dorset </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in 978. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> was canonized and his bones at <ORGANIZATION> Shaftesbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dorset </LOCATION> attracted pilgrims in the Middle Ages. The buried bones were found in 1930 but <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON>, two brothers who had inherited the site, could n't agree on what to do with them. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON> kept the bones and eventually presented them to the Russian community, while his <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON> sought to have them returned to the abbey site. `` I wanted them to be properly enshrined and only the Russian Orthodox Church was prepared to do that,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON> said. In the decision, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> awarded unspecified legal costs to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Brookwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> community. <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brookwood </ORGANIZATION>, said the reason for his church's interest in the bones dates to the 1054 split of <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION> into Eastern and Western churches. The Russian church claims <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> the Martyr as one of its own because the king died before the split and worshiped according to its original doctrines.

<TEXT>
 For two rubles, Soviet personal computer users soon will be able to access information probably beyond the capabilities of their present systems. In the first joint publishing venture between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, officials signed an agreement Monday to publish a Russian-language edition of a major personal computing magazine. `` No magazines of any kind in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> are based on the concept of a joint venture with another firm, for personal computers or anything else,'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salnicov </PERSON>, director of Radio i <ORGANIZATION> Sviaz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, said of the business agreement with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. About 50,000 copies of PC World <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> will hit Soviet bookstores and newsstands in late June priced at two rubles, or $ 3.20 at the official exchange rate, said <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> The magazine will contain about one-third original copy written by a staff of seven Soviet editors and writers. Personal computing is in its infancy in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which officials said has had trouble manufacturing computers. There are fewer than 100,000 personal computers in the country, but Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials tout a potential market of 30 million. The liberalization of foreign investment laws, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost and the recent easing of Western technology export laws are critical to the publication of the new magazine. <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high-tech export regulations were eased in January to allow 16-bit personal computers to be sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He predicted that American, Western European and Japanese computer makers will rush to secure joint production agreements. In keeping with Soviet guidelines on joint ventures adopted in January 1987, the Soviet partner will own 51 percent of the project to <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION>'s 49 percent. <PERSON> Salnicov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Volodarsky </PERSON>, chief advisor to the chairman of Goskomizdat, the Soviet state committee on publishing, printing and book trade, signed the agreement at <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> has invested $ 250,000 in the project but expects to recoup that almost immediately through advertising from Western computer makers seeking a foothold in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the principle problem with about 30 joint ventures between the Soviets and foreign companies to date has been the repatriation of hard currency. But <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> said PC World <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>'s sales will cover all production costs and that its revenues will come from advertising paid for in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> currencies. Foreign firms typically have had problems getting ruble earnings out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salnicov </PERSON> said some foreign language computer journals are available in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> libraries but that Soviet PC users have no information about developments within the country. <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> publishes PC World, the second largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publication on personal computers with a monthly circulation of about 475,000.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s embattled ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> blames his troubles with his own government on an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> adviser to Panamanian military strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Ambassador <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> told a news conference Monday his dismissal from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s army after 22 years service followed an argument with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Harare </PERSON>, a security adviser to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, who denied reports he also had been dismissed as ambassador, said his disagreements with <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> arose after he accused the Israeli of using his position to charge large commissions to Israelis trying to do business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` He blocked commercial ties and potential investments,'' <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> told reporters at his home outside <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` He demanded commissions before anyone could even set foot in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> is reportedly in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but efforts to locate him for comment were unsuccessful. A three-page, unsigned flyer issued in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last year accused <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> of making huge profits from business deals, including arms sales, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said in a telephone interview. The league issued a report linking anti-Semitic threats in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to the allegations against <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said that in January he `` went to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and told the government everything I knew about <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. I tore the mask off his face.'' He said the two quarreled in April after the ambassador sold an embassy car driven by <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. The ambassador said he sold the car to save money. <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> sent the ambassador a threatening letter warning him not to sell the car. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> wrote back saying he was not afraid. `` The letter arrived on April 18. That evening, the -LRB- Panamanian -RRB- radio reported that I was dismissed from the army,'' <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. No reason was given for <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>'s dismissal in reports from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but sources told reporters there that <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> had twice refused instructions to return home. <PERSON> Herrara </PERSON> said Monday an order for him to return home had been rescinded. He also denied reports from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that he was fired as ambassador. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said the Israeli government has not received any notification from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> has been dismissed. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and holds the power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Eighteen Arrested In Scheme To Steal Telephone Access Devices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eighteen people have been arrested for stealing and marketing long distance access codes that rang up an estimated $ 4.5 million in fraudulent telephone calls, officials said. The arrests came after a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> returned indictments alleging theft of telephone access codes that may have been obtained through sophisticated computer technology, federal officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office here, said in a news release Monday the 18 people were charged with conspiracy to steal and market long distance codes in a nationwide network. The indictments said the defendants acquired long distance telephone credit card numbers and access codes and then marketed those codes to defraud long distance telephone companies, the officials said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said they said they seized numerous unauthorized access codes and a variety of computer and telecommunications equipment used in the conspiracy. Access codes are numbers dialed before a telephone number that allow a caller to use a particular company's long-distance network. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the indictments and arrests culminated an eight-month undercover operation by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> into the wholesale marketing of unauthorized access codes. Agents made more than 600 undercover telephone contacts with people involved in marketing the codes, officials said. The undercover agents received more than 600 unauthorized telephone access codes from the individuals charged. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the industry has indicated that more than $ 4.5 million in fraudulent calls can be attributed to those 600 codes. According to industry estimates, several of those indicted are principal operators of marketing networks responsible for $ 125 million in telephone access fraud over the past year, they said. This represents half of the estimated loss of this type from such marketing schemes throughout the nation, they said. The government said the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a long distance telephone clearinghouse, estimates losses from all types of access device fraud at about $ 500 million annually for the $ 40 billion per year long distance telephone industry.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s family intends to continue its fight to vindicate the retired <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> autoworker who was sentenced to hang after an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court determined he was the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death-camp guard `` Ivan the Terrible.'' An Israeli panel of judges Monday sentenced <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, to death. The three judges ruled a week ago that the former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> concentration camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law, said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> `` has been railroaded through the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court system.'' <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> said the family still believes that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is innocent and would `` fight all the way to the end.'' `` I spoke to Mr. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> yesterday. He believes half the world already knows he is not ` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible' and the rest of the world will learn it soon,'' <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> claimed a case of mistaken identity, but some concentration camp survivors identified <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as the prison guard who would beat Jews on the way to the gas chamber. The judges ruled that his alibi, that he was a prisoner of war who never was in <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, did not stand up to scrutiny. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horrigan </PERSON>, who as an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney represented the government in <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s 1981 denaturalization trial, said the death sentence came as no surprise. `` In the end, they, like every other court or tribunal who looked at the case, were left with little alternative but to find him guilty and impose the only sentence consistent with that finding,'' <PERSON> Horrigan </PERSON> said. `` His alibi was a joke.'' But members of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s Ukrainian community still believed <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. `` It has been the unanimous opinion of this parish that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is innocent. That has been the opinion since the beginning,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakonachny </PERSON>, a priest at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vladimir </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> family's parish. After the verdict, vandals painted purple circles on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vladimir </LOCATION>'s, and Jewish organizations in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, asked for additional police protection because callers were threatening local Jews. Police said a priest at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vladimir </ORGANIZATION>'s told them the purple paint might signify blood on the church. In <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s former attorney said he does not think <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> will be executed. `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> people are the real jury,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> for five years during deportation proceedings and during the beginning of trial. `` While they have doubts I do n't see how the court can go through with it.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he was fired last year because <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s family thought he was being `` pro-Jewish'' by refraining from attacking witnesses and using the Talmud to make his points. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Plax </PERSON>, Cleveland-area director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the sentencing represented `` a sense of relief and closure that the sort of behavior exhibited by ` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible' has been adjudicated. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dackiewicz </PERSON>, operating the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demjanjuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said donations to the fund had slackened recently, but calls picked up again Monday. `` The phone calls are from people who have been totally outraged at what happened over there,'' she said. `` They're people from all different backgrounds wanting to donate money and asking what they can do to help.''

<TEXT>
 A fire at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> storage depot gave off a huge cloud of smoke that dusted nearby communities with dangerous asbestos, authorities said. Officials used bullhorns to warn people living just west of Monday's fire to stay inside and avoid stirring up the asbestos powder. The asbestos came from the roof of the burning 10-acre warehouse at the depot in <LOCATION> Donnington </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A team of 120 local workers put on masks and protective clothing to clean up the worst contaminated areas. Asbestos is a fibrous material used to fireproof and insulate. It has been linked to lung cancer and other diseases, and other building materials have increasingly replaced it. In dust form, asbestos can cause an often fatal lung disease called pneumoconiosis. The warehouse that caught fire is part of a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> depot employing several thousand people. It is one of the Western defense alliance's biggest storage areas for technical equipment and spare parts for military vehicles. The army said the warehouse contained no ammunition. No cause of the fire was given. The 190 civilian and British army personnel working in the warehouse were evacuated, and there were no reports of injury. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said damage was expected to run into millions of dollars.

<HEAD>Former President Says Party Ticket With Jackson `Amazingly
Attractive'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said today that a Democratic presidential ticket with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be `` amazingly attractive'' and enable the party to carry the South. `` Six months ago, to be blunt about it, I would have said ` no','' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has fooled everyone.'' The former president said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` attractiveness and the quality of his campaign has been amazing'' and `` it's much easier to say very honestly that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be amazingly attractive on the ticket compared to what everybody thought he would do before this campaign started.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he thought a ticket with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on it would win in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and carry his home state of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` As you know, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came in first in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> as it was,'' he said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> did not specify whether he envisioned <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the presidential or vice presidential slot. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who will attend the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> as a `` super delegate,'' has refused to endorse any of the party's candidates, but said if someone `` had to bet one way or another,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be the most likely nominee Asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should be the party's vice presidential choice, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said it would be improper for him to presume that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ not <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ would win the nomination. He added that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins the nomination, `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has exhibited in the last year or so a remarkable element of substantiality and common sense and loyalty to the party and attractiveness to a wide range of people and I guess then, in the convention, that whatever happens, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support will be constructive whether he's on the ticket or not.''

 An anti-nuclear group's choices for the nation's worst nuclear power plants are largely identical to a list compiled by government regulators in 1986. The group, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday named 16 plants as the nation's worst. Thirteen of those plants were also on the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s list. Of the 16, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> named two as worst than the rest. Those plants were Pilgrim, near <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. Both were closed throughout 1987 at the insistence of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to correct operational and management problems. Local authorities are discussing the sale of Rancho Seco, now operating at 30 percent of full power under recent restart approval granted by the commission, and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> voters will decide next month whether to keep it open. `` The similarity between Public Citizen's list and the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s list strongly suggests that these plants are indeed the worst in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Critical Mass'' project said in its Monday report entitled `` Nuclear Lemons. Public Citizen is an advocacy organization founded by consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>. Responding, the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-nuclear trade group, said industry performance is improving, as shown by reductions in unplanned automatic shutdowns of reactors, radiation exposure and lost-time accidents. Spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> said the committee had not had a chance to study the Pulic Citizen report in detail. Public Citizen ranked the nation's 105 operating civilian nuclear power reactors according to 10 criteria such as downtime, operation and maintenance expense and exposure of the workforce to radiation. A reactor was awarded 15 points if it was the worst in a category, 14 if the second worst and so forth. Rankings were made by the number of `` 15 worst'' lists the reactor appeared on, with points used as a tiebreaker. The 16 plants named by Public Citizen are: <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; Pilgrim, <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; Peach Bottom No. 3, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; Peach Bottom No. 2, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; Fermi No. 2, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Forked </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; Sequoyah No. 1, <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry No. 2, <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry No. 3, <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry No. 1, <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Besse </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>; Dresden No. 2, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; LaSalle No. 1, <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; Sequoyah No. 2, <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and Byron No. 1, <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, Ill. The Ranch Seco, Pilgrim, <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry plants were all closed throughout 1987. A similar list compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 originally included <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and the two Cook plant reactors at <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. These three were deleted and replaced by the two Peach Bottom reactors. The commission also included the LaSalle No. 2 plant and the <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> Point No. 3 and No. 4 plants near <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and did not include the Dresden No. 2 and Byron No. 1 plants that appeared on Public Citizen's list.

 Riot police today fired tear gas to break up demonstrations against alleged vote fraud as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> cast ballots for a new parliament in an election the governing party was expected to win. The opposition, which failed to unify before the election, charged the government was manipulating vote-counting computers after a state-run television station reported Monday that a governing party candidate had won with 39 percent of the vote. The <ORGANIZATION> MBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> said a local affiliate on <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> accidentally broadcast an election rehearsal. The network said it fired the station manager and four other officials. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> prosecutors today said their counterparts on <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> were investigating whether election laws were violated by the broadcast. The state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> KBS </ORGANIZATION> television network, meanwhile, reported after the polls closed that five governing party members and three opposition candidates were leading their races. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police fired tear gas to disperse 300 <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students who threw rocks and firebombs to protest alleged election manipulation in favor of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Earlier, police broke up a similar protest by 50 <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> students. No injuries were reported in either demonstration. In the afternoon, hundreds of students dashed through alleys and sidestreets in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s downtown Myongdong shopping area, shouting slogans against `` election rigging'' and chanting `` Down with dictatorship.'' Police pursued them, sometimes hurling tear gas grenades. At one point, citizens rescued a student being dragged away by riot police. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency, said police arrested more 120 students in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and nearby areas in southwestern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION>, about 500 dissidents and opposition supporters battled riot police in the streets for nearly two hours. Voting began at 7 a.m. at 13,812 pollings stations nationwide to choose a 299-member National Assembly. The polls closed at 6 p.m. -LRB- 5 a.m. EDT -RRB-. Most returns were expected by early Wednesday. Officials estimated 72.6 percent of the 26.2 million registered voters turned out, down from 84.6 percent in the 1985 legislative elections and 89.2 percent in the December presidential election. Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who ran for an assembly seat in the southern city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, accused the government of staging `` unfair, unjust elections unprecedented in our history.'' On Monday, the governing party expelled one candidate after 4,296 envelopes, each containing the equivalent of about $ 30 and campaign leaflets for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Kwon </PERSON> <PERSON> Joong-dong </PERSON>, were intercepted by opposition members at a post office in <LOCATION> Andong </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police reported 90 cases of election-related violence nationwide in the campaign, with more than 150 people detained and 77 of them formally charged. A 90-second broadcast on Monday on southern <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> by an affiliate of the state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> MBC </ORGANIZATION> national television network said a governing party candidate had won in a local district and it gave vote totals. The network later apologized for what it called a technical error by engineers during a rehearsal for scheduled live broadcast of the ballot count. But protesters said the use of definite numbers in the broadcast was proof the government planned to manipulate the computer vote count. About 400 students in <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION> marched in the streets early today, protesting `` an unforgivable government attempt at computer manipulation.'' Students in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION> also held rallies to denounce the broadcast and vowed to launch more anti-government protests. Later, however, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said: `` The voting is proceeding relatively smoothly.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s rising popularity and a split within the opposition were expected to help the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> win a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Public support for the opposition eroded after its leaders, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> of the Party for Peace and Democracy and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, both insisted on running in the December presidential election, splitting the opposition vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won the first direct presidential election in 16 years with 36 percent of the vote. The opposition gained momentum in widespread anti-government protests last June. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, then chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to many of the democratic reforms demanded by the opposition and the political climate has become freer. The governing party, campaigning on pledges of stability for economic and democratic progress, hoped to win about 125 of the 224 seats being decided in single-member districts, along with 38 of the 75 seats to be decided by the parties' nationwide vote proportions. A new constitution that took effect in February gives the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> greater power in such matters as inspecting state affairs, and the president no longer can dissolve it.

More than 500 Americans still are listed as missing in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> from the war in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. In the negotiations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the two sides are to discuss the processing of Vietnamese under the Orderly Departure Program.

 A federal appeals court has decided that attorneys for indicted <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> do n't have a right to secret documents the federal government is protecting. A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled unanimously Monday that a lower court was incorrect in ordering government prosecutors to share the documents. Federal prosecutors want to keep the documents confidential until the July 12 trial of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and co-defendants <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, fellow officers of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s Teamsters Local 507 The appeals court reversed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, who had ruled in favor of defense attorneys. `` In essence, the district court concluded ... that the defense has a constitutional right to know the tactical strengths and weaknesses of the government's case against it.

 An evacuation rehearsal of the town surrounding the nation's only methyl isocyanate plant was not realistic because it was too well planned, critics claim. Sirens sounded twice about seven minutes apart at <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to signal the evacuation, the first coming at 9:19 a.m., 19 minutes late. One hour later, only about 30 people had arrived at an emergency shelter in nearby <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` The participation of citizens is not all that important,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON>, who called Monday's exercise successful. Most residents and workers at businesses and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> State College either skipped work or ignored the drill. Construction workers at the college's new science building across the street from one siren continued working. The town is the site of a <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION> chemical plant that formerly was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The plant produces methyl isocyanate, the chemical that leaked from a Union Carbide plant in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, in 1984, killing more than 2,000 people. Less than a year after the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> disaster, the leak of another chemical at the Institute plant injured at least 135 people, prompting the call by some community leaders for an organized evacuation plan for the town of 1,500. Local officials built a one-lane emergency road to help residents flee, but the gate to that road is kept locked except when needed. Monday was the first time it was used. Stump said the drill was designed primarily as a training exercise for police, firefighters and other emergency workers. `` It's like basic training in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>; you know the procedures but every real incident will be different,'' he said. Monday's evacuation was conducted under special circumstances. <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, next door to the plant, called off classes in the morning, so there were few students to evacuate. The town also was evacuated in stages so the roads leading out of town would n't be too crowded. `` When this was prepared, people did n't take it seriously,'' said <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON>, a custodian at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> State. `` I'm sure if the students were here, they would n't know what was going on.'' `` I can envision cars all over the track. It's just a little trail. It would be mayhem,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a health and physical education instructor at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> State. `` It will be a mess.'' <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyree </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION> employee and <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> resident, was among dozens of volunteers who manned the streets to direct traffic, carried out emergency procedures or took notes on Monday's drill `` All in all I think the community's glad this kind of response is going on,'' said <PERSON> Tyree </PERSON>. `` I'm sure a lot of persons have learned what to do in an emergency as far as coordinating ... learning who does what.'' <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, who lives about a mile from the plant, said she did n't hear the siren and did n't realize the drill was under way until her husband came by their house. `` I wanted to participate so they can get an accurate play out on what would happen,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said. `` If they're going to spend all that money trying to get this operation, the least we can do is participate.''

<HEAD>AMA Files to have FDA Regulate `Smokeless' Cigarettes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s move to seek federal regulation of so-called `` smokeless cigarettes'' is premature and unecessary, a tobacco company spokesman says. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to regulate the nicotine products, introduced last fall by <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and to review their ingredients and safety before they go on the market. Dr. <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> board member, said nicotine is an addictive, harmful drug that constricts blood vessels. Because the Reynolds cigarette contains nicotine, he said, it should be regulated. `` It promotes and maintains the nicotine addiction,'' he said in an interview. `` For those individuals who have vascular disease, it is particularly dangerous because they may be lulled into thinking they are using a safe product,'' he said. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said court decisions have affirmed that cigarettes do not come under <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations, and the new product should be in the same category. <PERSON> Fishel </PERSON> said the new cigarette, which generates a smaller amount of smoke than regular cigarettes, is being tested and results will be available to the scientific community before it is test marketed. `` We think it's a very uninformed, premature attempt to bring about regulation of a product which they know very little about at this point,'' <PERSON> Fishel </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> petition. At a news conference unveiling the cigarette last September, <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Horrigan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the company was not claiming the new product was a safe or safer cigarette. He said, however, that it eliminated or greatly reduced most of the compounds produced by burning tobacco, `` including most compounds that are often associated with the smoking-and-health controversy.'' But <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said any impression that the `` smokeless'' cigarette is better for health is dangerous. `` It's sort of like saying ` We wo n't have people dying from lung cancer; we'll have them dying from vascular disease'' because of nicotine's effects, <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> said. Vascular disease affects the arteries and veins, causing blood circulation problems. The Reynolds cigarette introduced in September contains tobacco that is heated, but not burned. Nicotine is delivered to the user through a tiny metal capsule which, when heated, produces an aerosol resembling tobacco smoke. A piece of charcoal in the `` smokeless'' cigarette's end is lit and generates the heat, <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, initially indicated it hoped to market-test the product this year. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> petition states that other products with nicotine, such as gum and a non-tobacco cigarette that produces a nicotine vapor, have come under official <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny. Under federal law, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has six months to respond to the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> petition. In a related issue, three other health groups asked the government Monday to begin regulating low-tar cigarettes on grounds that advertising claims for the products make them a drug subject to federal oversight. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> argued that advertisements pushing cigarettes with low levels of tar and nicotine in essense make a health benefit claim for those products. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribb </PERSON> said the groups' petition would be reviewed in the next few weeks.

 Israeli troops today ambushed a band of Arabs at the Lebanese border as the guerrillas launched a raid into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the military said. Three Arabs and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were killed. Two other soldiers were wounded, the army said. One was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, hospital authorities said. The Israeli army said the clash occurred 200 yards inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after troops on an early morning patrol encountered guerrillas trying to infiltrate from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. However, a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> police spokesman said the pre-dawn clash occurred in <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> territory near the southern village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shouba </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops opened fire at a seven-man guerrilla group. The army said soldiers chased the guerrillas through rocky terrain and scrub brush and fought a brief battle in which the guerrillas threw hand grenades and fired a rocket. The Lebanese police spokesman said the `` fierce clash'' raged for about three hours. The Israelis `` fired flares at the rate of 20 every five minutes as their helicopter gunships chased the guerrillas in the region,'' he said. The guerrillas were `` apparently ambushed before launching a cross-border raid into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with standing regulations. Israeli radio said the soldiers fought the guerrillas at a distance of two yards but did not give the exact site of the clash. The Lebanese police spokesman said the guerrillas were from two pro-Soviet groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>. Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, head of northern command, identified the guerrillas as Palestinians. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is made up of <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuba </PERSON> is a small village on the slopes of biblical Mt. <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON>, about one mile from an area where the borders of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> converge. The Lebanese village is inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone.'' The zone, intended to protect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from attacks across the border, was created by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1985 after it withdrew most of its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> said the guerrillas had targeted `` civilians, children, Israeli settlements'' in their raid. The army did not say whether any guerrillas escaped. News of the incident was held up eight hours while the border was searched. `` It was difficult, bushy terrain, easy to hide in,'' said a military commander at the scene who was interviewed by Israeli radio but not identified in keeping with army regulations. `` We closed off the area and chased them for several hours. They hid in the bushes and were difficult to see,'' he said. `` They fired first at our force and the soldiers fired back.'' Today's incident was the 11th attempted infiltration and the deadliest along the Lebanese border since Nov. 25 when a guerrilla landed in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a hang glider, entered a military base and killed six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers before being shot to death himself. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have linked past infiltration attempts to a nearly five-month long Arab uprising in the occupied territories in which 173 Palestinians and two Israelis have died. The two dead soldiers were the first Israeli casualties involving <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Feb. 23, when two soldiers died when their tank ran over a mine in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The most recent attempted infiltration was April 13, when soldiers shot and killed three Arab guerrillas on a hostage-taking mission. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and news reports said Israeli steps to break the Palestinian uprising could temporarily block tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabagh </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the army was preventing people from reaching jobs by taking their identity cards and returning them only after the Arabs underwent lengthy checks at three government offices. Israeli television said the program was aimed at breaking a tax boycott that has been a tactic of the Palestinian uprising. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemned the assassination of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military commander. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not use its veto, allowing the resolution to pass 14-0. <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, was gunned down April 16 at his home in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Israeli sources and Tunisian officials have said <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was slain by Israeli commandos. The Israeli government has declined comment. Israeli leaders expressed concern about attempts by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> to end five years of bloody rivalry and revive a hard-line alliance against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, who expelled <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in 1983, met the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief on Monday in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hail Damages Cars, But Tornado Passes Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thunderstorms peppered 10 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> counties with hail the size of tennis balls, leaving thousands of car owners and car dealerships sizing up dents and cracked windshields. `` It looks horrible,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McGough </PERSON> said Monday as he surveyed the lot at Capitol Chevrolet in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. `` We've got close to 2,000 vehicles on our lot, and I would say 99 percent of them have some damage,'' <PERSON> McGough </PERSON> said. `` Hail is the worst thing that can happen to an automobile dealership because it dents all your vehicles up.'' <PERSON> McGough </PERSON> said one employee estimated damages at close to $ 500,000. Meanwhile, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> were relieved that even worse damage was avoided as tornadoes swept across three counties without touching down. Tornado warnings, which mean a tornado has been spotted on radar, were issued in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> counties during the late afternoon. By 7:30 p.m., however, the warnings had been lifted. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>, a spokesman at the Montgomery-based AEMC, said officials received numerous reports of heavy thunderstorms and hailstorms, but that there were no reports of a tornado touching down. In <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, an ambulance driver called emergency officials to report winds gusting so hard that he could n't control his vehicle. State troopers reported no fatalities or serious injuries related to the storms. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the tornado warnings were issued after radar showed several funnel clouds moving toward <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> at about 60 mph. `` It's like a tornado aloft, but not touching the ground,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said hail from an inch and a half to three inches in diameter is often produced in such a storm. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said the emergency office had heard several descriptions of the size of the hail. `` We've heard anything from tennis-ball sized up to baseball-sized.'' In <LOCATION> Eufaula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said, officials reported `` pigeon egg-sized hail.'' `` I think somebody sits around and tries to think up this terminology,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nationwide Seizure Of Grapefruits Ordered After Poison Found In
Rome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health authorities today ordered the seizure of all grapefruits in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> after tests showed that several grapefruits in a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> supermarket had been laced with poison. Italian news media said the poisoned grapefruits apparently had been imported from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, although officials did not immediately say where they were grown. Last week, an organization saying it was supporting the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories claimed it had poisoned Israeli grapefruit on sale in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. Laboratory checks at the time found no trace of poison. But authorities in the region of <LOCATION> Lazio </LOCATION>, which includes the city of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said health officials later inspected grapefruits in one <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> supermarket after a newspaper received a threatening telephone call. Of the 12 grapefruits on sale, six were found to have been injected with a bluish poison so powerful that it immediately killed laboratory mice, the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The caller said he was speaking in the name of the previously unheard of `` Organization of Metropolitan Proletarians and Oppressed People.'' The first seizure order was made today by health authorities in <LOCATION> Lazio </LOCATION>. It was quickly followed by a national health ministry order for the seizure of all grapefruits on sale or in warehouses around the country. In <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, the northern region of <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> issued a separate announcement that ordered all Israeli-grown grapefruits seized. It appealed to residents to destroy any grapefruits they had at home. Israeli-grown `` <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION>'' grapefruit in cellophane wrappers are sold widely around <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Woman Gets Two Years In Plea For Shaking Baby To Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who shook her 13-day-old son so violently that he died must spend just over a year in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aust </PERSON>, 22, pleaded guilty Monday as part of an agreement in which first-degree murder charges against her were dropped. She was sentenced to eight years in prison, but <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> suspended all but two years and credited her with the time served since her arrest in August.

<TEXT>
 Jurors who convicted former Mayor <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> on perjury and conspiracy charges could be put on trial themselves under an appeals court ruling on jury tampering allegations, a dissenting judge said. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said Monday he will appeal a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, which ordered a lower court to hold an evidentiary hearing on jury misconduct and jury tampering allegations. Compelling former <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> jurors to testify in the hearing could create a `` colossal discouragement'' towards jury duty among citizens, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney. `` It used to be that jurors were protected from that. The law wanted to protect them from that kind of intimidation and harassment,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. `` This certainly transcends the <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> case and we're concerned about it.'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said Monday's ruling was a dangerous precedent because the evidentiary hearing could expose jurors to subpoenas under new trial motions. `` Until now, it seemed fairly clear that you could not bring a juror -LRB- on subpoena -RRB- into a motion for a new trial in a criminal case,'' said <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, who litigated the appeal for the district attorney's office. `` That's a change in the law and creates a conflict of authority amongst published cases.'' The dissenting judge in the 2-1 ruling agreed. Justice <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the decision `` authorizes a trial of jurors who return a guilty verdict in a criminal case.'' In the majority opinion, justices said the trial judge failed to properly consider jury misconduct complaints by <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON>, who resigned as a convicted felon on Dec. 10, 1985, two months after his conviction. However, the majority opinion added: `` In our view, the evidence fully supports the jury's conclusion that <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> was part of a conspiracy to violate the disclosure requirements of the Political Reform Act and the local campaign finance laws.'' <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON>'s conviction stemmed from a campaign finance conspiracy and coverup attempt in which hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions went unreported on state-mandated disclosure forms. <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevilla </PERSON>, alleged in his appeal that a bailiff made derogatory remarks within earshot of the sequestered jurors, telling one person the former mayor was guilty and that prosecutors would win the case `` hands down.'' The allegations against the bailiff were cited in affidavits by two jurors. The remaining 10 jurors and the bailiff denied the allegations. The justices rejected 23 other issues raised in <ORGANIZATION> Sevilla </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal. <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON>, who now works as a local radio talk show host, was convicted in October 1985 on one count of conspiracy and 12 counts of perjury in his second trial. His first trial ended in a mistrial when the jury hung 11-1 in favor of conviction. The charges stemmed from a plot to illegally finance his successful 1983 mayoral campaign with more than $ 350,000 from the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. investment firm. <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> was sentenced to a year in jail and three years probation and fined $ 1,000, but has remained free pending his appeal. He is vacationing in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> this week.

 Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> says she will file amended financial disclosure statements listing land, loans and partnerships to avoid `` additional doubts and nitpicking.'' But former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who faces criminal charges over alleged omissions on his statements, notes that amending his statements did n't help him. A top aide to Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said meanwhile that his office was looking into Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s original filings and that `` under the circumstances now'' it could not give Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> advice. Lawmakers said they would prefer to leave matters in <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s hands, but some left open the possibility of another legislative investigation, similar to the one that led to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment `` We'll just have to wait until the <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> says,'' said House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who initiated the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> investigation after <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s activities were being scrutinized by a grand jury. `` I just hope she gets everything fixed up.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s office, in a written statement, said she hoped to file the changes by the end of the week but needed more time to research them. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> had not listed land, loan and partnership transactions on the public officer reporting forms that she was in charge of during her 10 years as Secretary of State. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said that many of the transactions stemmed from arrangements made by her former husband and that she had not profited from them. `` I'm not trying to hide anything,'' she said at the time, adding that everything was reported on her income-tax forms. She declined to make the returns public. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> married T.R. Mofford in 1957. They were divorced 10 years later, but the governor says they remained good friends until T.R. died in 1983. On Monday, the governor reiterated her position. `` I still question whether the law requires that these items be disclosed, but I wish to avoid even the appearance of impropriety,'' she said. `` <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> has been through enough without additional doubts and nitpicking.'' But <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, read Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s statement, laughed and said `` I love it'' when he got to the passage about doubts and nitpicking. `` I do n't see any place in the -LRB- reporting -RRB- law where it says you have to make any profit,'' he added, saying that the transaction he is accused of concealing _ a $ 350,000 campaign loan _ did not involve any profit to him. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said she would ask <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> to determine whether the items should have been included on her disclosure forms `` so that his advice can be available to her and to other public officials faced with questions,'' her office said. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> was out of town Monday, but chief assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Twist </PERSON> said his agency planned to review records of the transactions. `` Under the circumstances now, it would not be appropriate for us to give any personal advice to the governor,'' Twist said.

<TEXT>
 A government commission said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks can immediately resume some operations suspended nearly two months ago, but customers will not be allowed to withdraw much-needed cash The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that banks can resume offering a dozen services that were suspended following the imposition of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions aimed at ousting strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In another development, an opposition leader said Monday that a group of Panamanian dissidents is planning to undertake a military operation against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by the beginning of next week. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has maintained his loyalty to ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, told reporters the group is made up of officers who have supporters in the Panamanian Defense Forces. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> gave no details, but the group apparently is comprised of high-ranking defectors from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shortly after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster two months ago. A coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last month was put down quickly. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, quoted an unidentified official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as saying the sweeping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions were a mistake and that they will be relaxed `` within a week or so.'' The Times today quoted the official as saying that the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, charged with enforcing the sanctions, was considering a long list of exemptions. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s newly appointed foreign minister on Monday said his top priorities are normalizing relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and persuading it to lift the economic sanctions. The minister, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, made the comment in an interview at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the services banks can now resume include handling letters of credit, transferring funds within the country, collecting outstanding loans and currency and metals exchanges. Although customers will not be allowed to withdraw cash, the panel called the resumption of services `` an important and decisive step'' toward normal banking operations. The cash crisis has become so severe in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that many people have been forced to resort to bartering to obtain food for their families. Panamanian banks were ordered shut March 4 because there was not enough cash to cover withdrawals. Some banks reopened on April 18, but only to accept deposits. The closures followed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions that included the freezing of Panamanian funds held in American accounts and the withholding of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> toll fees normally paid to the government. The sanctions helped create a liquidity crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its official currency. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration hoped they would help oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the power behind the civilian government, is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. He denies the charges. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian chief executive, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, said on Monday that he will talk with domestic opponents of the government only if they dropped calls for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation. `` What we will not do is surrender before the start of battle,'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> told reporters. Opposition leaders rejected an offer of negotiations with the government in March, saying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must leave first.

<HEAD>Swiss And U.S. Say Iran Ambassador Question Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> said today that it would not reconsider its decision to accept the new Iranian ambassador despite allegations from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he played a key role in the 1979-1980 <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hostage crisis. A Swiss Foreign Ministry statement made it clear that despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition the Swiss government would accept <PERSON> Sayid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON> as ambassador. The four-sentence statement followed a meeting between <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador Faith <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittlesey </PERSON> and State Secretary <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> at which both sides presented their views in the case. `` Thus, both sides consider the question as settled,'' it said. `` We agree that the question is settled but we remain disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Korff </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy spokesman. In a separate press statement, Mrs. <PERSON> Whittlesay </PERSON> said `` all aspects of the recent press reports concerning the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's interest'' in <LOCATION> Malaek </LOCATION> were reviewed at today's meeting. `` We have no intention of allowing our disappointment in this matter to complicate the excellent relations that continue to exist between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has been representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic interests in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following the November 1979 seizure of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Fifty-two Americans were held hostage by Iranian militants for 444 days. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung newspaper said Monday that <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> planned to reiterate at his meeting that <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> does not have sufficient evidence to reject <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON>, who presented his credentials March 22. The newspaper said the `` Americans failed to present the Swiss authorities with a dossier compiling the evidence allegedly incriminating Malaek.'' <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> said Friday that <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON>'s role as one of the leaders in the hostage-taking was so well known that fou Western countries refused to accept him as envoy. The Neue Zuercher Zeitung said <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> was referring to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Citing Swiss sources, it said the Canadians told the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that they can not recall any request by <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON> for accreditation. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> is headed by a charge d'affaires who does not require accreditation. The newspaper said there was also `` no substantial information from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aimed today to add <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to the string of primary victories propelling him toward the Democratic presidential nomination, while Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expected to lock up the Republican nomination. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> counted on large turnouts in the state's two biggest cities to give him a shot at an upset victory over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the non-binding popularity vote that was part of a long, complex primary ballot. But Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was virtually assured of capturing a solid majority of the 178 convention delegates at stake in the primary and add to his growing lead in the two-man race for the nomination. `` The turnout is light this morning,'' said <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Elections Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>. But he added, `` I think the weather will help a lot. It's going to be a beautiful day.'' In northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, Erie County Elections Supervisor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Edler </PERSON> said polling places reported good turnout. `` The weather is sunshiny,'' she said. `` It's beautiful. The turnout's been fantastic this morning.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got high praise from former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> who appeared on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> show, `` Good Morning America'' and said the former civil rights activist would be `` amazingly attractive'' on the Democratic ticket. The former president said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` attractiveness and the quality of his campaign has been amazing'' and `` it's much easier to say very honestly that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be amazingly attractive on the ticket compared to what everybody thought he would do before this campaign started.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning today in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, had critical words for the former president, saying that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would return the country `` to the malaise days of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>.'' During the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` there was n't a malaise. There was a lack of leadership. I want to build on our outstanding record.'' All the candidates wound up their <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> campaigning on Monday and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scheduled appearances today in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the next big state on the primary schedule. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was back in the governor's office in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. With 1,081 delegates in the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was only 58 short of the 1,139 needed for a majority at the Republican National Convention in August. His only active opponent, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, has 31. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> elects 78 Republican delegates, giving the vice president a strong chance to get his majority when the results come in tonight. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has put together a string of primary victories in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to knock out all opposition but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and build the impression that his nomination is inevitable. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was more than halfway toward a delegate majority, holding 1,075.15 national convention votes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 836.1 while 602.75 are uncommitted. A tally of 2,081 or more is needed to win the nomination at the July convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with a overwhelming victory in Monday night's <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> caucuses, also would win 19 of the 23 delegates from that state if late results hold up. With 90 percent of the legislative districts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 71 percent of the vote and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 17 percent, a total that would leave him with four delegates. About 11 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> voted in the caucuses to remain uncommitted. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> hold primaries next Tuesday. During campaign appearances on Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sounded as though he felt his strongest opponent was overconfidence. He urged supporters to ignore the polls that said he held a wide lead in the state. `` Pollsters do n't vote,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also took pains to explain the complicated ballot. `` It is n't enough just to vote for me,'' he told a rally in Erie. `` This is one election where you've got to vote more than once and it's legal. I need your vote as a candidate. Our delegates need your votes. ... We must do both.'' While he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> staged a long-distance debate over policy toward terrorists, jobs was the major theme at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appearances. `` Make no mistake about it,'' he said. `` I'm a dyed-in-the-wool, true-blue, full-employment Democrat.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also talked about jobs when he spoke to striking workers at a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> refinery outside <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said profits at the company were up 400 percent last year and said, `` For profits to be up and wages down is greedy and unfair.'' He told the strikers, `` I know it's tough, but hold on. I know it's tough, but Reaganomics is on the way out.'' He also referred to articles saying that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was appropriating many of his campaign themes. `` Well, No. 1, that ratifies my leadership,'' he said. `` But since he got my message, do n't choose margarine, choose butter, choose the real thing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured a job-retraining center in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and praised `` the combination of initiatives on the local level.'' On the question of dealings with terrorists, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> agreed that it was proper to talk with people who were holding Americans hostage in an effort to get their freedom. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` You never make concessions to terrorists _ ever.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rejected what he called `` material concessions'' to terrorists. But he said he could envision situations where he would agree to allow safe passage to hostage-takers and added, `` I choose negotiation over blind, bloody confrontation.''

 A convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, the first since last week's clash between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian naval forces, headed into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> today but turned back because of uncertainties about mines, shipping executives said. The executives, speaking on condition they not be identified, said a sandstorm over the gulf restricted visibility of helicopters and mine-hunting vessels accompanying the two tankers and their <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> escorts. A source close to the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said, however, that the convoy might get under way again within 24 hours. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials conceded earlier that the convoys were falling behind schedule because of concern about mines laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the central gulf and the threat of Iranian missile attacks in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the narrow entrance to the waterway. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guided missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was damaged by a mine on April 14, and about a dozen mines were later found in international waters used by commercial shipping. American military sources said six of the 11 Kuwaiti tankers reflagged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year have been waiting in the anchorage in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, departure point for the U.S-escorted convoys, for the past week. Two had been ready to move since April 15 and the other four arrived over the next few days, creating what one officer called an `` unprecedented traffic jam'' off the port of <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON>. A seventh tanker, the 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier Gas King, arrived at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on April 10. It has been stranded there, loaded but unable to sail down the gulf, because of what the source close to <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` reticence'' to risk the mine hazard. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns the reflagged ships. The company source said the decision to send the tankers to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> reflected a belief by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials that the minefield was clear and the missile threat was not serious enough to warrant further delays. `` British and French convoys have gone through the mine danger area without trouble,'' he said. The mine strike against the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> caused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to retaliate against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On April 18, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or damaged six Iranian gunboats and three <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships came under Iranian missile attack in the Strait of Hormuz, but were not hit. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said here that he could provide no information on the convoy movement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> customarily does not confirm the movement of Kuwaiti tanker convoys escorted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships until they have passed specific danger points in the gulf. Today's convoy was sighted on radar by coastal observers in the southern gulf. They were unable to identify the ships involved. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had denied last week that the escort operations had been suspended.

<HEAD>Polish Transport Workers Strike for 11 Hours</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Transit workers in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> were back on the job today after shutting down bus and streetcar service for 11 hours in a rare show of labor unrest by a government-sanctioned union. The bus and streetcar drivers ended their walkout Monday by agreeing to hourly pay raises of about 60 percent, the chairman of the official union said. `` People are not satisfied but this is sufficient for them at the moment,'' said <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Matuszewski </PERSON>. The sudden walkout in this western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> city forced thousands of people to walk to work and school Monday. A spokeswoman for the official transport workers union, one of the labor groups put together by the government after the activist trade union Solidarity was banned in the 1981 martial law crackdown, said the strike even took union leaders by surprise. `` It was an initiative of the drivers,'' she said. Buses and streetcars rolled again at about 5.30 p.m. on Monday. Workers negotiated with a deputy mayor and a deputy provicial governor at a streetcar depot in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>, the spokeswoman said. The union spokeswoman said hourly pay will increase by 12 cents to 33 cents. One driver said he now earns the equivalent of $ 75 to $ 90 a month and expects his pay to be about $ 25 more. Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had said earlier he would go to <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> in support of the strikers, but he remained at home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, apparently because of the settlement. Pressure for pay increases has grown because prices of many necessities have gone up 42 percent this year under an economic reform program instituted by the communist government. According to official figures, wages had risen about 45 percent by April 1. Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the Polish leader, told managers of state enterprises last month they risked dismissal if they were too generous with wage increases. Meanwhile, two Solidarity leaders at a heavy machinery plant in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were fired because of a protest rally last week, and workers there are threatening to strike, an opposition spokesman said today. <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtas </PERSON>, chairman of the founding committee of the plant's Solidarity local, and <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Turasz </PERSON>, a committee member, were dismissed Monday from their jobs at the <ORGANIZATION> Stalowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wola </ORGANIZATION> mills, said <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaberna </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in the city. She said workers `` announced a strike alert and are preparing a general strike,'' but she did not know when it might take place. Opposition spokesman said about 5,000 workers took part in the rally the start of the afternoon shift at the sprawling plant in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, about 95 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The plant employs 18,000 workers.

<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The World Court today ruled against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' attempt to shut down the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The ruling implicitly condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> by supporting the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> position that the dispute must be submitted to independent arbitration. The ruling was the court's second decision against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in two years. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial arm condemned as a violation of international law the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's support for the rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. The World Court, officially known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its rulings. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office dispute emanates from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> anti-terrorist legislation signed into law by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last December. The legislation aims at closing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s 14-year-old observer mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The law classifies the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a `` terrorist organization,'' and bars it from operating on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s information office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> was closed down prior to the passage of the legislation. The attempt to shut down the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has been condemned by all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member nations except the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as well as by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also opposed the law. Briefs on the case have been filed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, as well as by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Although their contents are confidential, the East German and Syrian briefs are widely considered to support the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> position. Because only sovereign states and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> bodies are entitled to bring cases before the court, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was unable to plead its case before the 15-judge panel. At the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> filed the court case March 9 in the form of a request for a legal opinion on whether the dispute is subject to arbitration. The so-called Headquarters Agreement, a 1947 pact between the <ORGANIZATION> Truman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, specifies that disputes are subject to arbitration by a three-member panel. Under that treaty, diplomats of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member nations and organizations with observer status are guaranteed the right to operate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has rejected independent arbitration in the case as premature, noting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> case is under review by a federal court in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But in its submissions to the court, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has also said that the anti-terrorist law calls for closing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> `` irrespective of any international legal obligations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have under the Headquarters Agreement.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was accorded permanent observer status at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 and has maintained an office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> since then.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says He Will Raise Bullet Issue In New Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bullet lodged in <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON>'s buttocks since a robbery a decade ago is expected to surface again as an issue in attempts to keep <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON> from being executed. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday refused to consider a death row appeal based on prosecutors' remarks about the bullet during <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON>'s 1978 murder trial, but lawyer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> says he will raise the issue again in a different form. <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON> refused to let doctors remove the slug after the robbery and shooting death. Prosecutors told the jury trying him for capital murder in the death of Deputy Constable <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> that <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON> probably feared the bullet would be identified as having come from the dead officer's gun. <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> contended in his appeal that state District Judge <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by permitting the remarks. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declined to hear those arguments, but <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> said he will file a new appeal claiming that the mention of the bullet violated <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON>'s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. A 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling held that suspects have a constitutional right to refuse to have a bullet surgically removed, and in general, prosecutors `` may not use against you the fact that you invoked your constitutional rights,'' <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> said. He noted that prosecutors may not tell jurors that a defendant refused to talk to police. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has tried to strike a balance between protecting suspects against deeply intrusive acts such as forced surgery while still allowing police to get the evidence they need by such lesser measures as taking fingerprints or samples of hair, blood or skin, all of which are permitted, <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> said. But state Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> said federal courts generally will not rehear cases in which appeal is based on search and seizure issues that the defense has had a previous opportunity to raise. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> was working as a security guard at <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> Jan. 6, 1978, when it was held up by three men. <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 30, was killed in a shoot-out with police. The third man, <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillory </PERSON>, 27, later pleaded guilty to murder and testified against <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON> in return for a 40-year sentence. <PERSON> Guillory </PERSON> testified he saw <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON> standing over <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>. `` The officer asked <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> not to shoot him again,'' <PERSON> Guillory </PERSON> said, but <PERSON> Rougeau </PERSON> replied, `` Die like you should'' and pulled the trigger again.

In February, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> restored legal status to <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 98, whose green card was canceled by immigration officials in 1962. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> reduced the number of years normally necessary to get citizenship in her case and Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> became the first amnesty applicant granted citizenship on April 8. Mrs. <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> has been making television commercials for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to urge other aliens who qualify to apply for amnesty.

 Layoffs have forced the temporary closing of the city's treasurer's office because the city's primary bank account held only $ 884, officials said. Twenty-five layoffs took effect Monday and included all of Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s regular workers. `` They laid off my administrative assistant and two accountants,'' as well as four other workers, Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` They did n't leave anyone in here.'' Three workers from other departments were transferred into the treasurer's office, but Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said accountants and account clerks were replaced with clerk-typists and reference clerks. Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said a city payroll of about $ 230,000 is scheduled to be paid Friday. But even with an expected infusion of state sales-tax receipts during the week, the city could still not have enough to pay its workers, she said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> is plagued by a dwindling industrial base, high unemployment, crime and a growing municipal debt. The city also faces a $ 4 million judgment awarded last year to a man who suffered brain damage when he was beaten by a cellmate in the city jail. The company that had handled municipal trash collection filed suit last fall over $ 262,000 in unpaid bills. And last month the city pleaded innocent to charges that it is endangering its police officers with inadequate equipment. Layoffs were recommended two weeks ago by the city's <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to cut costs to meet payroll and pay city debts, including a $ 29,000 monthly garbage contract and a monthly $ 20,000 payment on the lawsuit judgment.

 A tenant whose rent-controlled apartment was demolished around him will get $ 2.9 million from the landlord for damages and harassment, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> jury has decided. The jury made the award Monday to <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellitti </PERSON>, a retired garment industry worker who has lived in a $ 350-a-month, two-bedroom apartment for 35 years. <PERSON> Bellitti </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruskin </PERSON>, said his client and the building's six other tenants were asked in 1983 to leave so the house could be gutted and renovated. <PERSON> Bellitti </PERSON> and his now-dead roommate, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizika </PERSON>, refused. <PERSON> Gruskin </PERSON> said that in the summer of 1984, the landlords, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavanant </PERSON>, gutted the building with <PERSON> Bellitti </PERSON> still there. `` During demolition, the ceilings and walls in my client's apartment collapsed,'' <PERSON> Gruskin </PERSON> said `` Fortunately, he was not physically injured.'' `` They could n't get him out legally so they decided to just try to drive him out by going ahead with work,'' the lawyer said. <PERSON> Gruskin </PERSON> said that in April 1985 he reached agreement with the Lavanants, owners of about eight buildings in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, to rebuild <PERSON> Bellitti </PERSON>'s apartment, but proceeded with the suit anyhow `` because of the way the landlord ignored my client's rights.'' After a six-day trial and two days of deliberations, the jury of three men and three women awarded Bellitti $ 400,000 in compensatory damages, a rent abatement worth about $ 6,000, and $ 2.5 million in punitive damages for the landlord's `` reckless disregard of the tenants' safety,'' <PERSON> Gruskin </PERSON> said. The lawyer said <PERSON> Rizika </PERSON>, also a retired garment industry worker, died in October 1986. He said his legal status regarding the award is not clear yet.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court said today that a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> inmate whose cell toilet was broken for 37 days may have grounds for a claim of cruel and unusual punishment. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> returned inmate <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s complaint to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> for further review. Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellam </PERSON> had ruled in favor of Warden <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samberg </PERSON> on the commode claim, as well as other issues raised by <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> alleged, in addition to the toilet and other complaints, that a lockdown at the downtown <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> prison was unlawful, that he was denied food, that he was illegally put in punitive confinement and that meals were unsanitary and insufficient. The appeals panel upheld <PERSON> Kellam </PERSON> on all points but the broken toilet, which <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said caused sewage to flood his cell. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also said he was denied cleaning materials and that his meals during a lockdown were slid under his cell bars through raw sewage. <PERSON> Samberg </PERSON>, in an affidavit, said he was not aware of any waste in <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s cell and that the delay in fixing the toilet was caused by having to wait for ordered parts. `` <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s description of his broken commode, if taken as true, may well state a claim for cruel and unusual punishment,'' the appeals panel said in returning the case to the lower court for a determination of the facts. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 44, is serving two life sentences plus 46 years for murder, robbery and other convictions. His sentence began in April 1970.

Workers at a big heavy machinery plant in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, meanwhile, threatened a strike today after two Solidarity leaders were fired for leading a protest rally there last week, members of the banned trade union federation said. According to <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bocian </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, the strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> mill in the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> began this morning in three departments of the plant and spread later to a fourth. A spokesman at the office of government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said only 900 workers went on strike. A spokeswoman at the plant office told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that no one authorized to comment was available. The reported job action came one day after an 11-hour strike by 2,800 transit workers in the western Polish city of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> achieved a wage increase for bus and tram drivers. The strike was reported in Polish newspapers and on television. The <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel workers seek pay increases of $ 30 a month, <PERSON> Bocian </PERSON> said. He said the strike was launched by <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Mach </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist. One worker reached at the plant by telephone, who identified himself only as an electronics engineer, said workshops were idle and talks with management representatives continued. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is getting hotter and hotter. Anything can happen anyplace,'' Solidarity chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters today in an impromptu news conference at the Norwegian embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. He met there privately with visiting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Thorvald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Asked about the <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> strike, which was led by members of the officially sanctioned trade union and not by Solidarity, he said: `` It does n't matter what you are a member of. People are fighting to improve their lives.'' Solidarity was declared illegal after the 1981 martial-law crackdown in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, although its leadership has managed to remain active. The government later organized an officially sanctioned trade union alliance, whose unions now claim 7 million members. Urban, at his weekly news conference, said that under <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s program of economic reform, decisions on pay no longer will be made by the central government He said factory managers themselves will have to decide how much their enterprises can afford to pay. The government says prices in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> rose 42 percent in the first three months of 1988, and wages climbed by 45 percent in the same period. Government officials have expressed concern that wages are growing too quickly and will spur even more inflation. At the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> heavy machinery plant in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtas </PERSON>, chairman of the founding committee of that plant's Solidarity local, and <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Turasz </PERSON>, a committee member, were fired Monday afternoon, said <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaberna </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in the city She said workers `` announced a strike alert and are preparing a general strike'' to protest the firings. She said she did not know when the job action would take place. Opposition spokesmen said <PERSON> Wojtas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turasz </PERSON> led about 5,000 workers in a rally before the start of the afternoon shift Thursday at the sprawling plant in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, about 95 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The plant employs 18,000 workers. Ms. <PERSON> Kaberna </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wojtas </PERSON> read a speech at the rally listing the Solidarity committee's demands, including across-the-board pay raises of $ 50 a month.

 Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leukemia specialist who treated victims of the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant disaster in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, predicted today that 3,000 to 30,000 people will die of cancer as a result of that accident. He also said he expected another major nuclear accident `` somewhere in the world in the next 25 years, maybe in the next 10 years.'' <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>'s forecast was a revision of his prediction a year ago that there would be as many as 75,000 Chernobyl cancer deaths. Last year, British radiologists said they expected that the delayed effect of the radiation would add about 1,000 deaths to the estimated 30 million cancer deaths that can be expected to occur in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the next 50 years. `` We're predicting at the moment somewhere between 3,000 and maybe as many as 30,000 extra deaths from cancer over the next 50 years,'' <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> said. He was interviewed from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning'' on the occasion of the second anniversary of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> and the publication of his book, `` Final Warning: The Legacy of Chernobyl.'' Half of the Chernobyl fatalities will occur outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, mostly in Eastern and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> said. `` When you have an accident in one of these power plants, it's an international event,'' he said `` And, it's always going to happen that at least half of the events are going to occur outside of the country of the accident. We're all in this together in a nuclear age.''

 Raw sewage is pouring into the <LOCATION> Chattahoochee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> treatment plant and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> officials have warned municipalities downstream in both <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Ruptured pipes at the R.M. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> Water Pollution Control Plant forced officials to start dumping untreated sewage into the Chattahoochee on Sunday. By midday today, the total spill was expected to exceed 180 million gallons. State officials took water samples at several locations Monday in an effort to determine how quickly the sewage was moving downstream and how serious the environmental damage might be. `` I would certainly not want to fall in the water,'' said <PERSON> Gib </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. In three cities downstream _ <LOCATION> LaGrange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> _ officials have been warned to take precautions to ensure that their drinking water is safe. Officials in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, which borders the west bank of the <LOCATION> Chattahoochee </LOCATION>, also were advised of the situation. Untreated sewage may contain large quantities of disease-causing bacteria and other microorganisms. The waste also can rob the river water of dissolved oxygen, which is necessary to fish and other aquatic organisms. Pumps were moved into the treatment plant Monday to remove 30 feet of water from the basement and sub-basement, where the ruptured pipes were located. The plant's own pumps were flooded and unable to function. City officials said it might take three or four days to fix the broken pipes and halt the spill.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today temporarily withdrew the press credentials of two foreign correspondents because they reported details of the assassination of a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader without submitting the reports to military censors, the reporters said. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> were required to hand over their credentials today to the Government Press Office. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, quoting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, reported that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was responsible for the April 16 killing of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, better known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> later reported details on the operation. He also quoted Israeli sources. Israeli sources have confirmed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carried out the assassination. The government has declined comment. The correspondents said they were told by press office head <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON> that their credentials, which journalists need to cover government officials, were revoked pending an investigation. Israeli law requires journalists to submit reports relating to security matters to military censors. The government has given a broad definition to security matters and has left submitting the reports to the correspondents' discretion. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> expressed anger Monday over the correspondents' reports. `` They -LRB- the journalists -RRB- should be punished,'' he was quoted as saying on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` It's natural that there are conflicts between any government keeping what it considers to be secrets and a free press,'' <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is one of those conflicts.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said that in his view he broke no censorship law `` because we just continued to work the way we always work. We waited for them to call us and they did n't so we assumed all was OK. I assumed what I had was a government leak.'' `` The whole area of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> censorship as it involves foreign correspondents is a gray area,'' he said. `` I think this is all a matter of crossed wires.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, 40, has worked in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the past five years after stints for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He has worked for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for 11 years. <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>, 38, has worked in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for two years. He previously was the paper's southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> bureau chief for three years and also worked in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 The blast that crippled the USS Bonefish may have been caused by a battery explosion, and three missing members of the submarine's crew may have died trying to save the lives of their comrades, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top officer said today. The Bonefish remained tethered to a rescue ship as officials waited for toxic gases to clear before starting salvage efforts after the Sunday explosions and fire that injured 22 crewman. <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> headquarters confirmed today that the first explosion occurred while the sub was at periscope depth. However, the spokesman refused to comment on speculation that the ship was recharging batteries at the time. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said a battery explosion was a likely cause, and said the three missing men might have died while saving the lives of their comrades. `` All three of those individuals ... were on watch in the ship's control room and were last seen there,'' said <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, who is chief of naval operations and a submariner himself `` So it may well be that they simply ensured that everyone got clear and they themselves did n't make it.'' Relatives of the missing sailors, meanwhile, maintained vigils. `` We still have a little ray of hope,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, mother of Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pisgah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` When he enrolled in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> I gave him to the Lord and I have to have trust in him now.'' The 30-year-old submarine, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s last diesel-electric subs, was participating in training exercises Sunday in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> about 160 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when it was rocked by a series of explosions. At least one blast occurred in the battery compartment and fire broke out in the forward battery compartment, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. The crew brought the sub to the surface and its captain, Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, ordered it abandoned because of the dense smoke and toxic fumes. Of the 92 officer and crew board, 89 were taken aboard the frigate USS <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and aircraft carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, which were involved in the exercises. The ships were unable to find the three crewmen, and officials were uncertain whether they were aboard the vessel or in the water. The Bonefish was afloat today alongside the submarine rescue ship USS Petrel. Salvage workers were to board the sub once experts decided it was safe, but <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials were unsure when that would be, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Long refused to say what types of toxic gases might be present or what caused the explosions. The Virginian-Pilot of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> reported today that the first explosion occurred at periscope depth, leading to speculation that the ship was recharging its batteries via a generator drawing air through a snorkel raised with the periscope. Fleet spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Henney </PERSON> confirmed this morning that the first explosion did occur at periscope depth, less than about 70 feet below the surface, but would not comment further. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said `` battery explosion is the best information that we have'' as to the cause. The salvage ship USS Hoist from the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amphibious </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> was expected to join the Petrel at the scene today. On Monday, injured sailors were taken by helicopter from the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Twenty were held for observation, and two were in serious but stable condition in intensive care suffering from smoke inhalation `` The majority of them are expected to be released today,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, hospital administrator. The only two that will definitely have to stay at least 48 hours are Lt. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Antone </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>. The injured crewmen will receive X-rays and pulmonary function tests to see if they have recovered from the effects of smoke inhalation, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said none of the sailors was expected to talk with the media about their experience after being released from the hospital. The rest of the crew was taken Monday to the <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, then flown back to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where the submarine is based. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Causey </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> went to <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> to meet their 30-year son, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Causey </PERSON>. `` He did n't say much. He was just glad to be back,'' <PERSON> Causey </PERSON> said. `` It's good to see him. I was on a submarine for 21 years, so I know what he's going through.'' The sailors, who refused to answer reporters' questions, looked grim as they walked across the windy tarmac at the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base to meet relatives. One had a bandage on his head. About 30 people, many holding balloons, greeted the plane. One woman held up a single yellow rose. Another held a balloon and wore a jacket reading `` Diesel Boats Forever'' beneath a cartoon of a submarine. The 219-foot Bonefish, commissioned in 1958, is powered on the surface by diesel engines, but when submerged it uses electric motors powered by two battery compartments. The batteries are recharged by a generator when the ship is surfaced. Each battery is equipped with an exhaust system to remove battery gases and hydrogen created during recharging. The Virginian-Pilot quoted retired Adm. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Train </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who commanded the Bonefish's sister ship the <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON> in the early 1960s, as saying that hydrogen builds up during recharging and can be hazardous if not vented. The Bonefish is among the last of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s diesel-electric submarines, which are used primarily to mimic Soviet submarines in training exercises. The Soviets still operate about 100 such subs. Besides <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, the missing were identified as Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Willis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today that the law establishing independent counsels unconstitutionally `` strips the president of a purely executive power'' and improperly relieves <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of its duty to scrutinize federal officials. The power to prosecute high-ranking federal officials `` can not be turned over to a serene process ... to platonic guardians'' outside the political fray, said Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, the administration's top courtroom lawyer. The justices heard 90 minutes of arguments in a crucial battle over the federal law that lets independent counsels investigate alleged crimes by high-ranking federal officials. Their decision is expected to be announced by July. Among those defending the law today were <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, questioned vigorously by several justices, said the post-Watergate law does not tip the balance of power the Constitution apportioned among the executive, legislative and judicial branches. He said the law permits the attorneyunsel must stay within the constitutionally required parameters of his office.'' <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> was responding to a question by Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, who raised concern <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might trigger a probe of an official simply because members of a committee did not like the official's response to their questions `` I am concerned about the reality of affecting the balance of power'' between the branches, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said. A congressional committee could call for an independent counsel investigation `` anytime testimony -LRB- by an official -RRB- is displeasing,'' he said. Fried said a problem of the law is that it excuses <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from exercising its proper scrutiny over the president. He cited the Watergate scandal as the prime example of the political system working properly. Public opinion and the threat of impeachment _ rather than an independent prosecutor _ guaranteed that the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration was investigated thoroughly, Fried said. `` Everyone knows those -LRB- Watergate -RRB- prosecutors proceeded to a denouement without missing a beat,'' he said. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court in February, has disqualified himself from taking part in the case without explanation. His absence creates the possibility of a 4-4 tie. A deadlock would have the effect of upholding a ruling by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here that struck down the special prosecutor law. The appeals court ruled that the Watergate-era law creating independent counsels impermissibly gives presidential appointment powers to the federal courts. The 2-1 appeals court ruling also said the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 were an unconstitutional encroachment of the exclusive power of the president to enforce criminal laws. Under the law, a special court appoints independent counsels or special prosecutors at the request of the attorney general to investigate alleged criminal wrongdoing. The law was challenged in the investigation of former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> is investigating allegations that <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 during a dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup program for toxic waste. Also at stake could be the January conviction of former presidential aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> for lying to a grand jury and to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities. The eventual <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision also might affect the indictments of former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three others accused of crimes in the Iran-Contra affair. However, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is acting in the Iran-Contra case with separate, backup power from Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, and that authority has been upheld by the courts. Nonetheless, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his co-defendants say <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s probe still is subject to constitutional challenge because his investigation began before the backup authority was conferred.

But the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the campaign of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s county clerks opposed the plan, saying it was contrary to party rules, would limit a voter's choices and would be expensive On Monday, <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON> decided to permit voters who wish to do so to pull one lever to select their candidate and his delegates.

The administration wasted no time in boasting about the GNP report. `` So much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the first quarter,'' Commerce Under Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said at a briefing for reporters. `` Today's report shows the economy entering its sixth year of expansion with inflation remaining moderate.'' In further good news, the growth was accompanied by a slowdown in the rate of inflation, with a price measure tied to the GNP rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said that the GNP report should allay fears that have cropped up recently in financial markets that growing inflationary pressures would force the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to raise interest rates in coming months. `` The economy is on track for moderate further expansion and restrained inflation in 1988,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said at a White House briefing. The GNP grew at a much faster 4.8 percent rate in the October-December quarter, but analysts said that growth masked some dangerous imbalances that were not present in the first quarter report. Almost all of the fourth quarter increase in GNP wound up as unsold inventory sitting on shelves. At the same time, consumer spending was taking a rare nose dive, falling by 2.5 percent, the biggest drop in seven years. This combination has in the past been a harbinger of a recession. This pattern was reversed in the first quarter with business inventories, which had risen by $ 39.4 billion in the fourth quarter, falling by $ 13.2 billion in the first quarter, indicating a success by businesses in reducing swollen inventories. Much of the success in working down the inventory bulge occurred in auto showrooms, as dealers were aided by a new round of sales incentives. This helped boost consumer spending by $ 23.6 billion in the first quarter, a 3.8 percent annual rate of increase. The report said more than half of that growth came in auto sales. Business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual rate of 32.5 percent in the first quarter, the fastest advance since a 39.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983. In other good news, the country's trade deficit, after removing the effects of inflation, narrowed by $ 3.6 billion in the first quarter, continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid-1986. The administration, which is forecasting that GNP will grow 2.9 percent for the full year, is counting on further improvements in the trade deficit to supply almost half of GNP growth this year. Much of the rest of the increase is expected to come from higher business capital spending as companies expand production facilities to meet a growing export demand. Both of those trends were evident in today's GNP report, providing good news for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which is counting on a sixth straight year of economic growth to boost chances for a Republican presidential win in November. In another report, the government said that after-tax corporate profits rose an even faster 2.6 percent in the final three months of 1987. This was an upward revision from a month ago, when the government put the increase in business profits at 1.6 percent. Two factors that held back GNP growth in the first quarter were a 9.4 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 22.3 percent drop in spending by the federal government, reflecting in large part a swing in farm subsidy payments. The various changes pushed the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, up by $ 21.8 billion, to a new annual rate of $ 3.90 trillion. The first quarter growth was welcome news when compared to forecasts being made at the beginning of the year. At the time, some analysts were actually predicting that the GNP would decline in the first quarter, signalling the start of a new recession. The pessimists believed that a combination of the shock to consumer confidence from the stock market collapse and the huge overhang of business inventories would severely depress economic activity in the early part of this year. The fear was that after a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth, nervous consumers would stop spending and manufacturers, caught with huge inventories of unsold goods, would cut back on production and lay off workers. But, those events did not occur. Instead of cutting back after the market turmoil, employers actually boosted hiring. Since October, an average of 362,000 new jobs have been added to the economy each month, more than twice the size of the monthly gains before the crash. The big gains in employment helped restore consumer confidence, considered critical for the economy's health since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is predicting that the GNP will expand at a 2.9 percent annual rate this year, marking the third consecutive year the economy has grown at this rate. This view is in line with the outlook of many private forecasters as well. Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a <LOCATION> Sedona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> newsletter, said that its latest survey of 51 top economists found a consensus forecast for growth of 2.7 percent this year, up significantly from a 1.9 percent GNP estimate made in the month following the market crash.

 Two seriously injured sailors from the USS Bonefish will remain hospitalized for at least two days, but most of the other sailors hurt after an explosion on the submarine will be released shortly, officials said today. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Tuesday that 19 of the 22 hospitalized sailors would probably be released today from a hospital at the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and flown to their homeport in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Sixty-seven uninjured fellow officers and crewmen solemnly returned home Monday while the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> continued its search for three sailors missing since Sunday afternoon's accident in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> 160 miles east of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The injured were taken from the disabled sub aboard the aircraft carrier USS <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The only two that will definitely have to stay at least 48 hours are Lt. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Antone </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, the hospital's administrator. They were listed in serious condition. The injured crewmen will receive X-rays and pulmonary function tests to see if they have recovered from the effects of smoke inhalation, he said. Most of the injured crewmen suffered smoke inhalation, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The submarine had a crew of 92 men. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said none of the sailors here was expected to talk to the media about their experience after being released from the hospital. The uninjured sailors, many wearing blue coveralls and some of them shoeless, also refused to answer reporters' questions here or after they returned to their home base in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>. A few carried small plastic bags, apparently holding personal belongings Sailors arriving at the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> looked grim as they walked across the windy tarmac to meet relatives. One sailor's head was bandaged About 30 people, many holding balloons, greeted the plane there. One woman held a single yellow rose aloft. Another held a balloon with the legend `` P.S. I Love You'' and wore a jacket reading `` Diesel Boats Forever'' beneath a cartoon of a submarine. The Bonefish is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s last diesel-electric subs. While the crew waited on a bus for the ride to their own base, sailors sitting at the windows were asked if they were all right. `` Yes,'' one unidentified sailor said. `` Thank God for that.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Causey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> drove to <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> to greet their son, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Causey </PERSON>, 30. `` He did n't say much. He was just glad to be back,'' <PERSON> Causey </PERSON> said. `` It's good to see him. I was on a submarine for 21 years, so I know what he's going through.'' Chaplain <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> went aboard the other rescue ship, the frigate USS Carr, at <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> and visited the Bonefish crewmen. The general mood was `` overwhelming fatigue,'' he said, adding that most had been up all night and many had been on watch the night before. Most spent the night in the <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s mess hall, talking about the experience. `` They've been through a real trauma,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said.

 Presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials today that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> should be treated as a terrorist nation because it backs <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> rebels who have allegedly killed 100,000 civilians. The Democrat was briefed at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on a recent study describing `` systematic abuse'' and murder by the <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> rebels. He told reporters that the sponsorship of the rebels by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` defines state-sponsored terrorism.'' <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, joining <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at a news conference outside the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ties to the rebels. But he declined to characterize <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a terrorist state, saying only that its involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> goes against a previous commitment made by <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> described the session this morning, which included Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, as a briefing session for the candidate. The study was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gersony </PERSON> and released a week ago. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> siezed on it to underscore his call for a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the so-called frontline states around it. The report was based on <PERSON> Gersony </PERSON>'s interviews with 196 <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> refugees and numerous relief workers who told of random murders, rapes, burning of villages, forced labor, mutilation, looting and beatings by <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to bring down <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist-led government `` It is conservatively estimated that 100,000 civilians may have been murdered by <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> in this manner,'' the report concluded. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> challenged his Democratic opponent, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to also characterize <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a terrorist state. He also called for an increase in humanitarian aid to the frontline states and for a congressional delegation to visit <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and report to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on conditions there. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has sought to make <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and African affairs part of the presidential campaign debate, but other candidates have not made it an issue. Earlier today, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met at <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members and ambassadors of the frontline states on the issue. Some conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have called for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> officially supports the Mozambican government.

 Riot police battled protesters today during violent demonstrations against alleged vote fraud as opposition candidates took a surprise lead in about half of the Parliamentary races nationwide. With 30 percent of the vote counted, the state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> KBS </ORGANIZATION> television network reported that candidates from three opposition parties were leading in 117 races. Candidates in President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led in only 90. There were no immediate trends reported in the other 17 races for the 224 single-member districts. Another 75 seats in the 299-member assembly will be decided by the parties' nationwide vote proportions. The Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> predicted that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s party would fail to win a majority. Earlier predictions said the governing party would triumph because of divisions within the opposition. Opposition control of the legislature would have added impact under a new constitution that took effect in February, when <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> started a five-year term after winning office in December with 36 percent of the vote. The new basic law, part of democratic reforms begun last summer after widespread anti-government demonstrations, gives the assembly powers to investigate government actions. The president no longer can dissolve the legislature, which has a four-year term. Today's protests followed a report Monday by one television station that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Hyun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-dae </PERSON> had won a seat on southern <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with 39 percent of the vote. The station, part of the <ORGANIZATION> MBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION>, said the report accidentally went on the air during a rehearsal for today's election coverage. The network said it fired the station manager and four other officials. But the gaffe fueled protests on the island, where an estimated 1,000 people fought with police. News reports said authorities were investigating whether the broadcast broke election laws. In other developments, an opposition campaigner died after drenching himself in gasoline and igniting it during an argument with government supporters in the southern city of <LOCATION> Woekwan </LOCATION>, Korean press reports said. The man was identified as <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwang-ho </PERSON>, 21, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Korean newspapers also said two opposition campaigners were in critical condition after being stabbed by unknown assailants in <LOCATION> Hwasoon </LOCATION>, another southern city. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police fired tear gas to disperse 300 <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students who threw rocks and firebombs to protest alleged election manipulation in favor of the governing party. Earlier, police broke up a similar protest by 50 <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> students. No injuries were reported. Hundreds of students dashed through streets in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s downtown Myongdong shopping area, shouting slogans against `` election rigging'' and chanting `` Down with dictatorship.'' Police pursued them, sometimes hurling tear gas grenades. Citizens rescued a student being dragged away by riot police. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON> said police arrested more 120 students around <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION>, about 500 opposition supporters battled riot police. In <LOCATION> Mockpo </LOCATION>, another southern city, hundreds of protesters occupied downtown streets. Voting began at 7 a.m. and the polls closed at 6 p.m. -LRB- 5 a.m. EDT -RRB-. Officials estimated 72.6 percent of the 26.2 million registered voters turned out, down from 84.6 percent in the 1985 legislative elections and 89.2 percent in the December presidential election. Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who ran for an assembly seat in the southern city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, accused the government of staging `` unjust elections unprecedented in our history.'' On Monday, the governing party expelled one candidate after 4,296 envelopes, each containing about $ 30 and leaflets for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Kwon </PERSON> <PERSON> Joong-dong </PERSON>, were found by opposition members at a post office in <LOCATION> Andong </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. At an Andong cathedral, riot police fired tear gas at 40 <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> farmers who demanded the candidate's arrest, <PERSON> Yonhop </PERSON> said. Police reported 90 cases of election-related violence nationwide in the campaign, with more than 150 people detained and 77 of them formally charged. Observers said before the election that the opposition was too weak to win. Support for the opposition eroded after its leaders, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> of the Party for Peace and Democracy and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, ran in the December presidential election. They split the opposition vote and allowed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to win the first direct presidential election in 16 years. The governing party, campaigning on pledges of stability for economic and democratic progress, had hoped to win about 125 of the 224 seats being decided in single-member districts, along with 38 of the 75 seats to be decided by the parties' nationwide vote proportions.

 The leader of an American expedition in the <PERSON> Himalayas </PERSON> said Tuesday his missing colleague had fallen or frozen to death after reaching the top of 23,488-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pumori </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibindgut </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Wasilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, has been missing since April 18, the day he and expedition leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckey </PERSON> reached the top of the mountain. `` Either <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> fell to death or froze or both,'' said <PERSON> Tuckey </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Girdwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` We could not find his body. So we presume ... he has got to be dead right now.'' According to <PERSON> Tuckey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leibindgut </PERSON> disappeared at 6:40 p.m., two hours after the two had reached the summit, at a place about 148 feet below the highest point. `` At the summit, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> complained of dizziness and was acting confused,'' he said. `` So we descended a short way below the summit.'' `` It became dark ... -LRB- and -RRB- very windy,'' he continued. `` So, I started to dig a snow cave for us in preparation for spending the night there. While I was digging, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> wandered off and walked away. I have not seen him since then.'' <PERSON> Tuckey </PERSON>, 37, said he spent the night alone in the snow cave and the next day descended the east ridge of the mountain. On April 11, the two had started climbing the southern ridge of the peak, accompanied by <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopal </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Eldorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. The group left their base camp at the 17,318-foot level without the help of Sherpa guides, setting up their first camp the same day and a second camp the following day. White and <PERSON> Kopal </PERSON> then returned to base camp. `` They were moving slowly,'' <PERSON> Tuckey </PERSON> said. `` We thought we would have a better chance of success if we moved faster. So, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> and I continued. We went in Alpine style _ no fixed ropes even. That is why we had to go fast.'' During the climb, <PERSON> Tuckey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leigindgut </PERSON> spent some nights in snow caves and one night in the open without shelter. <PERSON> Tuckey </PERSON> said the toes on his right foot became frostbitten during the climb but he believed they would be OK.

 A black Labrador retriever whose hind legs are paralyzed won a bicycle as the top fund-raiser in a March of Dimes walk-a-thon. The dog, named <PERSON> Remy </PERSON>, raised $ 108 in pledges by completing an eight-mile route as part of the local March of Dimes chapter's <LOCATION> Walk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> fund-raising effort. A specially built cart holds the dog's crippled hind legs so that he can propel himself with his front legs `` It's amazing how fast he is,'' said <PERSON> Julianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a veterinary technician at the Prairie Veterinary Hospital in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> was an inspiration for the 34 participants in Sunday's walk, some of whom were in wheelchairs, said <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanzal </PERSON>, a state human services worker The hospital has cared for <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> since a hunter accidentally shot him in the spine nearly a year ago. `` He got his cart last summer, and he learned quickly how to use it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` He does n't scratch the woodwork anymore, and pulls himself up when he comes to a sidewalk or door sill. If he gets stuck in a corner or a deep pile of snow, he just backs himself out.'' Officials are still discussing what to do with the 10-speed bicycle that was offered as a prize for the top fund-raiser, Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. It may be traded for another model that would be better suited for a handicapped person, or auctioned to raise money for the March of Dimes, she said. While <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> wo n't get the bike, the dog thoroughly enjoyed the walk, Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` He has an extremely pleasant personality,'' she said. `` This was a big day for him.

 <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, once one of the nation's biggest makers of hard-core adult films, has filed for bankruptcy while its president faces federal charges. <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>, based in the suburban <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, claimed in an April 5 bankruptcy filing that it has no assets and more than 100 creditors, including film director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>, husband of actress <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> owes <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> $ 6,500 in royalties from a film titled `` Love You'' that he made in the mid 1970s. What happened to <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>'s films and licenses is a mystery. Former <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> salesman <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> has started a new adult video company called <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, which took over <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters and has thousands of videocassettes in its warehouse But <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> insists <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> has no connection to <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>. `` I have a silent partner,'' he said, refusing to identify that person. <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>, along with <ORGANIZATION> Caballero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, also both based in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, were at one time considered the Big Three in the pornographic film industry, said Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the police department's vice unit.

The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> alleges that since 1982 <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON> was shipping what the agency described as obscene videos across state lines, a federal offense. <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, 30, was quoted in Tuesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying he would plead guilty to the charges. However, he denied that <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> produced pornographic films, a violation of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s pandering laws if the movies are made in the state. <PERSON> Essex </PERSON> was founded in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the late 1960s by Colombian immigrant <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, who bought the rights to adult films and sold copies to theaters nationwide. He retired in 1979, turning over the business to his son <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>. The company quickly expanded into the home video market in the late 1970s when videocasette recorders became popular, transferring its huge film library to tape. But intense competition drove the price of videos down, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said. `` Today there are tapes selling for $ 5 that were selling for $ 42 two years ago,'' he said.

<HEAD>European Papers Comment on Demjanjuk Death Sentence</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Demjanjuk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading newspapers on Tuesday appealed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to spare the life of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, sentenced to hang for war crimes committed as concentration camp guard `` Ivan the Terrible.'' But two Swiss papers took the opposite line, saying the sentence was justified given the thousands of Jewish deaths ascribed to <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. Some European papers highlighted the cheers and singing that broke out in the public gallery when the judges announced the sentence. `` Singing and insults greet <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> death sentence,'' headlined the Independent in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Its competitor, The Times, said: `` Cheers and dancing at end of ` Ivan' trial.'' The conservative Times editorialized that the death penalty `` arouses misgivings,'' but said that since `` the sentence appeared to be little more than a formality, it is to the credit of the judges that they deliberated for three hours before pronouncing sentence.'' It added: `` If the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities could see their way to commuting the death sentence, this would further mark the emergence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as the civilized state it aspires to be. There could be few more appropriate ways in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could mark the 40th anniversary of its foundation.'' The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> commented that in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` the trials of war criminals assist an explicitly political and propagandist purpose: to remind the world until the end of time of the nature of the Holocaust, and what was done to the Jewish people.'' It added: `` Yet even for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in this 40th year of its existence, there must come a moment when it is time to look forward; not to forget the Holocaust, but to cauterize its terrible wounds.'' The Telegraph said: `` If <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is convinced of his guilt then let him rot in his cell.'' But it claimed the evidence against <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was flawed, and executing him `` could conceivably do as much harm to the Jewish nation today as ` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible' did to individual Jews.'' In <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the independent <PERSON> Basler </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> commented: `` Given the atrocities he has been convicted of, the sentence is of secondary importance. No punishment can render justice in his case.'' The conservative <PERSON> Neue </PERSON> <PERSON> Zurcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> agreed, saying: `` One could argue that it would be wiser to sentence a person, whose identity is only 99 percent sure, to life imprisonment instead of to death. But there is no third between guilt and innocence ... and the crimes committed ... justify the sentence imposed according to Israeli law.'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmerlich </PERSON>, a legal expert with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anzeiger </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> that his party condemns the death penalty in general, including in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` There is always the possibility of a mistake, and there is no way to correct such a mistake when the death penalty has been carried out.'' In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, Rabbi <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Soetendorp </PERSON> said he welcomed the death sentence as a symbol but did not want it carried out. `` I face a certain conflict of conscience because I am opposed to capital punishment,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Soetendorp </PERSON>, a prominent Dutch lobbyist for Jewish causes, said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> should be jailed for life. `` It's a good thing the trial's finally over ... and that it's become clear that he -LRB- <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> -RRB- really is <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrible </PERSON>,'' he said Reporting from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauduc </PERSON> wrote that if <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> lost his appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, he would hang, `` carrying away with him the memory of the horrors of an epoch, but also the doubts of all those who, looking at this man of peaceful appearance, have difficulty believing he could have committed such crimes.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> swept to an easy victory over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> presidential caucuses, preparing for today's delegate-rich <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary by collecting a large majority of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s 23 Democratic delegates. Unofficial results with 94 percent of the vote counted in Monday night's caucuses showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 7,550 votes, or 71 percent, compared with 1,682, or 16 percent, for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Some 1,231 voters, or 11 percent, were uncommitted. Those percentages would leave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 19 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with four. `` We're really happy,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> state campaign coordinator <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Knoblock </PERSON>. `` It's a long way from home to be winning by this kind of margin. We've been slowly climbing in the West, but this took a quantum leap.'' Complete statewide returns were not expected until late today. Campaign aides touted the victory as another sign that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had momentum going into today's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, where 178 delegates are at stake and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has been heavily favored in polls. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters, meanwhile, said they were pleased to have come away with any delegates from a state where 93 percent of the population is white and less than 1 percent is black. A candidate must get at least 15 percent of the vote to qualify for a share of the delegates. `` The votes that came in for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were certainly not all-inclusive minority votes. I feel very good about what we've done,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> state chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> In 1984, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won only 4 percent of the vote here. Counting the three `` super delegates'' who have endorsed him, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' total <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> count would be 22 delegates. National Committeewoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and state party Chairman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Horiuchi </PERSON> have endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, while National Committeeman and former Gov. <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rampton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Willey </PERSON> remain uncommitted. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also had the endorsement in the caucuses of former Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>. Of the 23 delegates apportioned in Monday night's binding balloting, 20 will be elected at the state convention in June, and three will be elected separately by the state party's central committee. In addition to the presidential poll, those attending the caucuses elected delegates to county conventions next month and voted for precinct captains. Republicans had planned a non-binding presidential preference vote, but abandoned the idea after Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> virtually locked up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Instead, Republicans voted on their preference for vice president and whether they favor holding a western regional primary in 1992 similar to the South's `` Super Tuesday'' this year Results of the Republican balloting will not be available for several days. <PERSON> Horiuchi </PERSON> said the turnout, estimated at more than 10,000, was considerably better than 1984, when only 6,000 to 7,000 attended what were then called mass meetings.

<TEXT>
 The Democratic presidential candidates have left behind <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> but the big industry problems that plague that state follow the campaign into the next round of primaries in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held solid leads over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in polls of voter sentiment leading up to next Tuesday's primaries in those Midwestern states. However, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces were hoping their candidate would be helped in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> by the efforts of <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, his campaign manager who helped steer the successful campaigns of Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> in 1982 and 1986. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> also holds its primary next Tuesday, and Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> predicts <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could win as much as 70 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vote in the city that gave <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> one of his few 1984 victories. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were expected to keep hitting hard at such issues as plant closings and a need for government to help create new jobs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s first appearance in the state was at a steel plant. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, already well ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the delegate count, could add to the increasing sense of inevitability about his nomination if he could win the lion's share of the 159 Democratic delegates at stake in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and the 79 in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was beginning a full week of campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides were speaking as if they were taking nothing for granted. `` We've got a tough job cut out for us in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, director of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> campaign. `` I do n't think there is any way to possibly downplay the effect that <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> will have on <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s primary.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spokeswoman, agreed, saying, `` It's certainly an asset for us because of <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s visibility here in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> area and his track record with past <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> campaigns. Still, state Rep. <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> McLin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> campaign chairman, said, `` I'm not fooling myself. It's going to be difficult. But I still think we have a chance.'' A Gallup Poll conducted April 8-10 showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 50 percent to 23 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also holds a comfortable lead in most recent polls in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> survey taken April 17-19 showed him favored by 49 percent to 21 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Democratic leaders have generally taken no stands on the race _ unlike four years ago when most endorsed <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, only to see <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> win a narrow victory in the primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' name will appear on ballots throughout <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> failed to qualify delegate slates in three of the state's 21 congressional districts: two largely rural districts with few black voters and a district west of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Although Democrats hold both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and virtually every statewide office in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the state has been friendly territory for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In 1984, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won the state with 59 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political science professor, said, `` I think two major things the candidates need to keep in mind are that the state really has eight major media markets. It is a difficult state to campaign in because there is no single dominant area. `` I think the other thing that really is new to the Democrats is that it finally is down to a two-person contest. ... That means, then, that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are campaigning against each other.'' In the Republican primary, 88 delegates are up for grabs in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and 30 in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, most of them expected to move into Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s column as he smoothly sails toward the GOP convention. In the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, 11 delegates will be directly chosen in the Democratic primary, a contest that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has virtually nailed down in the heavily black city.

 A spill at a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> refinery has left dozens of birds and marsh animals coated with crude oil during nesting season in the wildlife haven of the <LOCATION> Suisun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> marshland. By Monday, about 100 oiled birds _ including egrets, avocets, cinnamon teals, mallard ducks, grebes, herons and endangered clapper rail birds _ had been rescued and taken to centers in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> for cleaning, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, of the state Department of Fish and Game. In another <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> oil industry development, a federal judge has decided that local ordinances did not violate federal regulations in a ruling that threw out 10 of 13 oil industry claims against cities and counties attempting to control offshore drilling. The birds were trapped after 21,000 gallons of thick, unrefined crude gushed Saturday from <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refinery </ORGANIZATION> holding tank, 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The oil coats the birds' feathers, leaving them unable to keep warm or move around. Also threatened are the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse and such marsh creatures as tortoises, muskrats and otters. Volunteers have reported a dozen dead muskrats, several oil-coated turtles and a dead heron. State officials said Monday they planned to sacrifice a section of <LOCATION> Suisun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> marshland in order to save hundreds more acres of wetlands. `` We're trying to keep new areas from becoming oiled,'' said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. By Monday, a slick stretched 10 miles from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> east to <LOCATION> Ryer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Six vessels with oil skimmers and 16 vacuum tank-trucks were sent to capture oil but <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> estimated it could take until next week to clean up the oil. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said it traced the spill to a damaged drain on a tank on the west side of Interstate 680. <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> will have to pay for the damage, including new paint for the bottoms of hundreds of pleasure boats. In the offshore drilling case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> ruled in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that in 10 cases the local ordinances did not challenge federal supremacy as the oil industry had claimed. The judge, in a decision made public Monday, said further examination of the evidence was necessary to determine if ordinances in three areas might violate the commerce clause of the Constitution. The Western Oil and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> filed suit last August. Western Oil contended in the suit that the local ordinances would `` create a wall from the Mexican border to the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> state line blocking development of oil in the outer continental shelf.'' Development would be hindered by severe restrictions on onshore support facilities such as pipelines and processing plants, according to the suit. But the judge ruled the ordinances are not true obstacles to commerce. `` By implication, the judge has recognized the local governments have good reason to be concerned about the impacts and effects onshore facilities can have on the quality of their environments,'' said <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, attorney for the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which helped fight the claim. Western Oil spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Getts </PERSON> said he did n't know if the two associations would appeal the decision.

 The Communist Party chief in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was fired because of public protests about contaminated water that caused an outbreak of typhoid fever in which 121 people were hospitalized, it was reported Tuesday. No one died in the outbreak earlier this month in the city of <LOCATION> Tskhinvali </LOCATION>, about 45 miles northwest of the Georgian capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, according to the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>. The first secretary of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, F.S. <PERSON> Sanakoev </PERSON>, was fired at a regional party meeting Saturday, a week after protesters gathered in front of party headquarters to complain about the water, <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said. It said that 87 percent of the people who responded to a March 31 survey said the inadequate water supply was the city's main problem. `` In the best circumstances, there is only water in the homes in the mornings and the evenings. Often there is none at all,'' <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said. The representative of the Georgian regional government appointed a commission to propose a plan for improving the city's water supply, but the protesters were not satisfied with the offer. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said regional leaders had been negligent in not ensuring that a new water supply long under construction be put into service. The first patient was hospitalized with what was diagnosed as typhoid on April 2, and the outbreak reached its peak between April 11 and 15, when 121 people were hospitalized, according to the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>.

The measure, approved on Monday by voice vote, would implement an international treaty on child abduction that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed in 1981 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved five years later. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which had passed an almost identical bill March 28, approved on Monday a slightly different <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version giving jurisdiction over international child abduction cases to both state and federal courts. The measure is intended to remove difficult, time-consuming legal issues involved in returning children abducted to another country, often by the other parent, or helping foreign parents recover children wrongfully taken to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The manufacturer of baby swings that could collapse is offering free replacements. Involved are 6,562 wooden baby swings sold under the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hedstrom </ORGANIZATION> brand names. They were manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Hedstrom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, between April and December 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. According to the agency, four incidents have been reported in which the swings collapsed because the glue failed to hold the joints between the slats and frame. The models being replaced are <ORGANIZATION> Hedstrom </ORGANIZATION> brand 4-798 and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> brand 512.70907, the commission said. Consumers should stop using the swing and return it to the place of purchase for replacement.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration today affirmed its determination to push a $ 460 million arms purchase by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the argument that improving AWACS radar planes is essential to protect <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. A bipartisan group of 187 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members has written Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> opposing the sale of advanced equipment in light of the Saudis' recent secret purchase of missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that could devastate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> have offered assurances the missiles would not be nuclear-armed. `` We have not changed our view that the AWACS maintenance package is critical to our gulf policy,'' he said. `` The Saudi AWACS operation provides important support for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in the gulf, including protection of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel.'' American warships are protecting <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers, outfitted with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags, in the tanker war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A number of clashes with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have resulted. `` We expect to go forward with the formal notification in the near term,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said 186 other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members had signed a letter he wrote urging Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to withdraw the proposed sale. The letter was to be forwarded to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today after additional signatures were gathered. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> made the announcement Monday after learning the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> planned to serve notice later that day of the proposed sale, said spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Genachowski </PERSON>. Formal notification subsequently was postponed, he said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> said the administration had made no decision on when to formally notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the arms sales, but that officials were `` doing some consultations'' on the proposal, `` particularly since there has been some evidence of congressional concern.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has 30 days to pass legislation to block the arms sale once it is formally announced. Those signing the letter maintained it would be rewarding Saudi deceit to allow such a sale after recent disclosures that the Saudis had secretly purchased medium-range ballistic missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, meanwhile, today decided to sign the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty. The decision, as reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, is an apparent effort to reassure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it will not try to arm its CSS-2 missiles with nuclear warheads. The decision also could blunt <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s allegations that the missiles constituted a threat to its safety. The letter expresses concern that the Saudis `` went to such lengths to conceal the missile purchase from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In a separate letter sent earlier, 58 senators urged <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to rethink the proposed sale of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> fighting vehicles, <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> missiles and ground support equipment for AWACS early-warning aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members' letter says it is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy to sustain <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s advantage in quality of arms over the advantage in numbers possessed by more heavily populated Arab neighbors.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has expressed concern to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government and its congress regarding proposed legislation that would ban nuclear weapons in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The legislation, on which debate began in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> this week, would prohibit nuclear weapons at the two major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and would ban port calls by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships and planes carrying such arms. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had told the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> that the bill `` would permit no flexibility on nuclear matters and would be incompatible'' with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. That policy prohibits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from revealing whether its ships and planes are carrying nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> declined to further discuss the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> legislation, saying it was still in its early stages. The bill is expected to pass the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but would face strong opposition in the 200-member lower house. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has expressed strong opposition to such bans in other countries. It expelled <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> from a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> defense alliance with <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> adopted a nuclear ban, and has protested similar action being considered in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>.

 Engineers today lifted a giant oven lid to check a mirror that astronomers hope will lead to the next generation of super telescopes, and the huge piece of cooling glass was pronounced `` just fine.'' `` I do n't know how nervous you are, but I'm certainly feeling it,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Strittmatter </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday after engineers began spin-casting glass into what they hope will become a honeycombed 11-foot mirror, the largest ever to be made in that manner Colleague <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> is credited with the idea that he and other Steward astronomers hoped would bear fruit. The first 24 hours, during which the mirror actually is molded, are the most critical, <PERSON> Strittmatter </PERSON> said Monday. He said scientists were lifting the lid today to get a view of a `` red-hot product.'' <PERSON> Strittmatter </PERSON> said today the mirror apparently formed without any problems but that engineers and astronomers will have to wait the six weeks until they know for certain whether the mirror was successfully produced. `` So far, so good,'' <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> said. `` The trick is to get it from this temperature -LRB- about 1470 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- down to room temperature in one piece.'' The mirror, a prototype for more powerful telescopes than now exist, is to be sited at the <ORGANIZATION> Astrophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- ARC -RRB- telescope being built in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> ARC is a joint project of five universities _ the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. `` The goal is obviously to make much bigger mirrors than we have ever been able to make before,'' <PERSON> Strittmatter </PERSON> said. Traditional big mirrors have weighed four to five times more than the two tons the finished 11-foot mirror will be, and have required as many as two or three years to grind and polish, he said. In addition, they are slow to adjust to outside air temperature, making for blurred images, and require large support structures and buildings to house them, he said. The new technology offers many advantages, Angel and <PERSON> Strittmatter </PERSON> said. Combined with a new technique for polishing the glass blank with a more deeply curved surface, the mirror being cast and those to follow will have short focal lengths resulting in great cost savings through smaller buildings for the telescopes, they added. Domed telescopes thus could become a thing of the past, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Strittmatter </PERSON> said the advances have spurred renewed worldwide interest in astronomical research, with several new major telescopes planned, including a binocular-like telescope with twin 26-foot mirrors called the Columbus Project that would be the world's most powerful telescope. Collaborators include Italian astronomers, the universities of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Mirrors of 26 feet in diameter are considered the current limit, given atmospheric distortion, <PERSON> Strittmatter </PERSON> said. The honeycombed understructure, which makes for lightweight yet rigid construction, helps minimize the distortion, he said. Thermal temperatures of the mirror can be controlled much more effectively than in conventional telescope mirrors, he said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Steward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lab </ORGANIZATION>, beneath the stands of the university's football stadium, the 19-foot furnace began spinning about 8 -LCB- times a minute once its temperature reached 705 degrees Celsius, or about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. The furnace began heating late Saturday. Lab workers cast a 4-foot mirror in November with the same spinning furnace.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the peaceful <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday as he bid to lengthen his lead in convention delegates and certify his status as Democratic presidential front-runner. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought the final delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by far in the pre-election polls after a week-long campaign that looked and sounded more like a mutual admiration society than the typical 1988 Democratic primary brawl. Aides hoped the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor would win the popular vote impressively and claim as many as 150 of the 178 Democratic National Convention delegates at stake. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had scant hopes for a popular vote victory in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and already was looking ahead to next week's primaries in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> His chances in the delegate hunt were little better, since his campaign failed to file a complete slate of delegate candidates around the state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looked to the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> returns as the final count was tallied from his victory in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Monday night caucuses. The New Englander was ahead for 19 of 23 delegates at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began the day with 1,095.15 delegates, to 840.1 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It takes 2,081 to gain the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 1,081 of the 1,139 needed to nominate. Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has ceased active campaigning, had 31. `` We're putting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the top,'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> State Chairman <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said even before the polls closed. `` We're going to do the same thing in November,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination has been all but assurred since he routed his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rivals across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on Super Tuesday last month, and his aides have been working for weeks on their strategy for the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and for the fall campaign against the Democrats. The vice president has been running virtually uncontested for weeks, winning primaries and caucuses as they rolled by on the calendar and methodically claiming virtually all of the delegates available. He needed to win only 58 of the 78 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> delegates at stake to amass a nominating majority in The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count. In contrast, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't take on the air of prohibitive front-runner until a week ago, when he scored a decisive victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary and knocked Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> from the race. That left only himself and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as active candidates in the once-crowded Democratic race, and his aides said they hoped for a string of victories that would yield enough delegates to claim the nomination by the time the primary season ends on June 7.

<HEAD>Law Doesn't Require EPA Action Against State Pollution Plans,
Court Told</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never intended to allow states to challenge other states' air pollution control plans in efforts to reduce the precursors of acid rain, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told a federal appeals court Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCord </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> thus has no duty to order a group of Midwestern states, at the behest of a coalition of Northeastern states, to force pollution reductions on coal-burning utilities and other sources. In the section of the Clean Air Act relied on by the Northeastern states in a petition to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, `` there is no reference ... to a state -LRB- pollution control -RRB- implementation plan. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' intent ... was to focus on a source or group of sources'' that might cause air pollution across a state line, not an entire state or group of states, <PERSON> McCord </PERSON> told a three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. He said there was nothing in the history of the legislation giving <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> the duty to act against entire states when other states complain. The panel was hearing arguments for the second time in a lawsuit brought against <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The first argument in December 1985 had to be disregarded because two of the three judges that heard it left the court _ <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> to join the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> by resignation after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected his nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday's court hearing fell in the middle of three days of rallies and news conferences arranged by environmental groups seeking action against acid rain timed to coincide with the visit Wednesday of Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who also has been pressing the administration to reduce the northbound flow of air pollution from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that causes acid rain. As part of those events, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syrup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said at a news conference <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> syrup production had fallen 45 percent since 1981 and acid rain was `` the prime suspect.'' A 1985-1986 aerial survey of 27,000 square miles of Quebec maple stands showed 4 percent of the trees had lost more than 25 percent of their leaves and were doomed to die, and 44 percent had lost 11 percent to 25 percent of their leaves and were badly damaged, the institute said. Though researchers are still seeking the cause of maple decline, `` there is unquestionably a significant correlation between the death of maple trees and acid rain,'' Institute President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlan </PERSON> said. The institute and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> both called for enactment of pending revisions to the Clean Air Act that would institute an acid rain control program and other measures. But <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON>, executive vice president of the forestry association, said, `` For me to say how much acid rain is affecting -LRB- syrup -RRB- production is something I ca n't do.'' The Northeastern states are appealing <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of their petition requesting the agency to order revisions in the air pollution control plans of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, a principal precursor of acid rain. There are no federal laws on acid rain, so the complaining states had to argue that <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> could not meet various other federal air quality standards because of the Midwestern sulfur dioxide. The Clean Air Act has a section requiring the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator to make sure that one state's air pollution control plan does not cause impermissible pollution in another state before he approves the plan or revisions to it. In answering the Northeastern petitions, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it did not know enough to tell the allegedly offending states how to revise their plans. For the Northeastern states, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Sample </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> attorney general's office argued that opponents were overestimating the effects of granting the petition. `` It is not fair to say that our petition seeks to evaluate all sources or even all major sources'' of sulfur dioxide,'' he said. `` We have constantly urged the administrator -LRB- of EPA -RRB- to concentrate on the 50 major sources'' in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> debated twice in their <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary campaign, treating one another with exceptional good humor while attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The Democratic rivals held their hands aloft like prizefighters in a gesture of unity at one debate and proceeded to joke about the vice presidential slot on the ticket _ the No. 1 topic on the minds of Democrats everywhere. `` Are you interested?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a soft, back-stage voice. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even held a private meeting during the week with some of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s black supporters in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ with his rival's advance knowledge and approval Said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` However it goes, when it's all said and done ... we will come out -LRB- of the convention -RRB- as a unit to send the Reagan-Bush forces back to private life.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also began pointing his attack toward the Republicans during the week, saying it would be a `` tragedy'' if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed a trade bill over a provision requiring companies to give notice before closing manufacturing facilities. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got entangled the last two days of the campaign in a flap over how to deal with terrorists, particularly in situations where they were holding Americans hostage. In a speech Sunday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took issue with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hard-line statements opposed to negotiations with terrorists. `` I disagree with that,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` If I could get the hostages out, I'd do it.'' The next day he was peppered with questions about whether he was implying he would make concessions to hostage-takers. He rejected what he called `` material concessions,'' such as selling arms. But he added, `` I choose negotiation over blind bloody confrontation'' and said he would consider allowing terrorists safe passage in exchange for release of hostages. He also said, `` If we are going to deter terrorism we are going to have to address the underlying caucses of terrorism. Terrorism does not emerge out of the blue.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to continue `` showing the flag'' in the remainder of the primary season, despite his certain nonmination, and he had a feisty rejoinder when hecklers dogged him at one stop in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` I'm glad to see the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters here, or maybe the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters,'' he said. `` I welcome then in debate, and I will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them in the fall.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides said the vice president might soon begin focusing his criticism more specifically on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and less on Democrats in general. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> provided a preview when he described the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner as a `` Northern fried <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>,'' the man turned out of office in 1980 by the Reagan-Bush ticket. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman also said the vice president intends to summon <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors and experts to his home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> for a week-long brainstorming session in June to help shape the foreign policy and economic issues for the fall campaign.

 <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> ditched his wife and job in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> five years ago and started a secret life here with a new wife, but he attracted police curiosity when he paid cash for a house and expensive cars. Police Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> finally unraveled the mystery surrounding <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> after seeing his picture on an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> flier issued in connection with the television series `` Unsolved Mysteries.'' Authorities said <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, 40, was arrested Monday and accused of embezzling $ 1.1 million from the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where he had worked for 10 years and was described as a reliable and respected employee. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelt </PERSON> today ordered <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> held without bond at least until a detention hearing, which was scheduled for Friday afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> admitted his identity following his arrest,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent in charge of the district office at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and police called <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> and asked him to come to the police station to discuss a neighborhood juvenile case that <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> and his new wife had reported. `` I showed him the flier and asked him if he was <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> and he answered, ` Yes, I am,''' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` There was a big sigh of relief and then he said, ` I'll cooperate fully however I can.''' <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> was reported missing by his wife and family in July 1983, the same time the money disappeared from the credit union. Authorities believe <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> took a July 21 flight to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but were unable to track him. He called home to alert his wife to a letter he left behind saying he took the money and fled because he `` could no longer cope with home and work pressures.'' In part of the letter included in federal court documents, <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> wrote to his wife that, `` This is a very difficult letter to write but I could n't let you find out from someone else first. If I call you to read this letter, it means that I have successfully left the state with around $ 1 million from the credit union.'' In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, his wife, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>, has divorced him and retained custody of their three children _ who were 11, 7 and a year old when their father disappeared. For the past three years, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and others at the <ORGANIZATION> Friendswood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have been researching <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> after he bought a home and two expensive sports cars in cash, but had no visible means of support. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> had been in <LOCATION> Friendswood </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, since 1984 when he bought his house, a Ferrari and an <PERSON> Alfa </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>. `` We did a reverse investigation,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` We researched how he came into a lot of money. When he bought his house and fancy cars in cash, people were suspicious.'' `` There was no doubt in my mind it was him when I saw the flier,'' he said. `` I was shocked. I probably have 600 pages of reports on this guy from the last three years and he looks the same.'' <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> has since remarried and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> says the new wife had no idea of <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>'s real identity.

<HEAD>Museum Visitor Points Out Error In Remington Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bronze cowboy sculpture `` The Rattlesnake'' by famed Western artist <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> stopped museum visitor <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> in his tracks _ the cowboy's tiny spurs were on upside down. `` There's no way a cowboy would wear his spurs pointing up like that,'' said <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON>, a former rodeo cowboy who now drives a beer truck and raises quarter horses. `` It would be totally out of character.'' <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON>, who was touring the Remington exhibit Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, apparently was the first to notice the error. `` I saw it immediately,'' he said. `` I just think it's funny that nobody noticed it before now.'' After <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> pointed out the problem, museum workers checked other bronzes on display. They found that all the spurs on the four horsemen in a casting of `` Coming Through The Rye'' were also upside down. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassrick </PERSON>, one of the curators of the exhibit, said he has occasionally noticed similar problems with <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> works in private collections. He said he had n't noticed the problem in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> exhibit. But that does n't necessarily mean that <PERSON> Remington </PERSON>, the famed sculptor and painter of Western themes who lived from 1861 to 1909, made the error. The spurs on the bronzes and other small pieces were cast separately from the main work and, as a result, it was sometimes left to a foundry worker with little knowledge of a cowboy's gear to attach the spurs to the boots. On other occasions, <PERSON> Hassrick </PERSON> said, the spurs may have been damaged and replacement spurs attached turned the wrong way. `` It's just a silly little thing, but I'm sure Remington wold have liked to have seen them the right way,'' <PERSON> Hassrick </PERSON> said. `` If they were on one of our bronzes, we'd turn them around,'' said <PERSON> Hassrick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cody </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and an authority on <PERSON> Remington </PERSON>. Neither of the works in question, however, is owned by the museum. `` The Rattlesnake'' casting is from a private collection, and the casting of `` Coming Through the Rye'' is on loan from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The exhibit is open in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> through May 22.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> navigational satellites that put on a spectacular light show after launch reached their planned circular polar orbit Tuesday, officials at this coastal base said. A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> consultant at <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Forney </PERSON>, said the launch aboard a Scout rocket Monday evening went `` by the numbers.'' <PERSON> Forney </PERSON> said solar panels that charge the batteries powering the satellite were deployed on one of the satellites shortly after it reached orbit. The spare satellite will be stored in orbit until needed. The functional satellite will be operational in 10 days. The OSCAR satellites, each weighing 131 pounds, are used as a navigational system for submarines and commercial shipping, as well as in oil and mineral deposit work. Their 6:57 p.m. launch left an exhaust contrail clearly visible from <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, about 100 miles to the south. The contrail was the result of a `` twilight phenomenon,'' said Master Sgt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zielsdorf </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> spokesman. `` It is the result of spent fuel from the booster rocket as it travels through the upper atmosphere. The fuel combines with water droplets that crystallize,'' he said. `` Those crystals are struck by high-altitude sunlight,'' he added. `` It may be dark on Earth, but there's still sunlight above. It causes an aurora borealis effect and is usually visible for 15 to 20 minutes.'' The contrail, which reflected shades of blue and green over <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, resembled a giant pretzel in that area after it was blown by high-altitude winds.

 Accused drug kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> virtually admitted his guilt in radio and television interviews given in 1983 and 1985, federal prosecutors claimed Tuesday as they argued for the interviews to be presented at his trial. But defense attorney <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>, arguing against allowing the jury to see and hear the tapes, claimed that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, was being tried for his political views instead of the 11-count indictment. The indictment alleges <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Defense and prosecution attorneys went line-by-line over transcripts of a radio interview and a television interview <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> gave in late June 1983, before he was indicted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts; and a jungle television interview given in February 1985, when <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was a fugitive on the charges for which he is now being tried. The jury was excused during the arguments. `` The entire statement amounts to a confession,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, when discussing a section of the radio transcript that dealt with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s activities on the island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` This is his manifesto,'' said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who added that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> equated his cocaine smuggling with the liquor smuggling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the Prohibition era. `` This is a very eloquent statement ... that Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is in fact guilty,'' said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, after reviewing the transcript of the audio tape. <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> charged that certain parts of the tapes are highly prejudicial and should not be admitted into evidence. `` This has become a political trial, nothing more, nothing less,'' said <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>. `` This is not a political trial. This is not a political crime,'' answered <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who added that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> smuggled drugs to further his political views. It now appears that the prosecution may rest its case on Thursday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said he may recess most of Wednesday to allow him to determine whether the tapes, which are in Spanish, can be admitted into evidence. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged only with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy.

<HEAD>Danes Told to Choose Between Nuclear Ban and NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Political leaders are telling <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> to choose in upcoming elections between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies and the country's longstanding ban on nuclear weapons. Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> backer, called the parliamentary elections for May 10, urging voters to `` take a stand'' in favor of the Western military alliance. The sudden storm over <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s role in the 16-nation alliance came as a surprise to many voters. The peacetime ban on nuclear weapons has been in effect for three decades, and a shaky coalition government has been struggling with economic, not military issues. Indeed, some voters say economic troubles remain the chief issue. `` It's not just a question about nuclear weapons but about the way the government runs society,'' said <PERSON> Susane </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, a conservative voter who works in a health insurance office. `` We have to face these economic problems.'' The unexpected showdown began April 14 when the leftist opposition pushed through a parliamentary resolution intended to strengthen the country's ban on peacetime nuclear weapons. The move, which has been delayed pending the election, requires the government to notify individual warships of the country's ban. Parliamentary negotiators have not decided if the ships would then have to respond. Until now, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> has simply stated its policy to one and all. Some allies reacted sharply to the latest proposal, warning it jeopardizes <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s participation in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. A meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s Nuclear Planning Group was rescheduled from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> called off naval maneuvers in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. Some <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> have reacted with resentment to the foreign pressures. `` Has the <PERSON> Danes </PERSON>' national pride deteriorated so much that we will bow to pressure from abroad?'' the left-leaning newspaper Information asked in a front-page editorial. `` The question is the central one in the current debate, and in that sense, the election is the most important since World War II.'' Of course, it did not help matters when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> joked to reporters that `` Danish means breakfast to me.'' National radio played the English-language tape on the air, an unusual step. `` Reagan Staff Demonstrates its Knowledge of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>,'' said a sarcastic headline in the liberal Politiken newspaper. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> later apologized. The confrontation comes at a politically unstable time for this country of 5 million people. The last general election in September left <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s center-right coalition in command of just 70 of parliament's 179 votes _ just enough to command a majority on economic matters. Polls suggest that <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> favor <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> membership. A recently published poll by the Observa organization showed that 66 percent of <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> favor staying in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and just 16 percent oppose it, the most lopsided margin in years. A Gallup poll said <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> favor membership 59 percent to 16 percent. Another survey, published in the <LOCATION> Boersen </LOCATION> business newspaper, showed that 46 percent of <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> believed it was reasonable to ask <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ships to guarantee they carry no nuclear arms, 36 percent did not and 18 percent were undecided. The responses crossed political lines. Further strains in relations between <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and its allies could carry strategic implications. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s low-lying peninsula and islands command approaches to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategists envision it as a key supply point in case of invasion from the east. The dispute follows years of contention over <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s declining defense spending, which amounts to 2 percent of its gross national product, among the lowest in the alliance. However, random interviews with window shoppers along <PERSON> Stroeget </PERSON>, a pedestrian street in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, suggest many people are more worried about the country's weak economy than its military role. Unemployment is running at 9.7 percent, and the national debt has reached $ 43 billion. <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thy </PERSON>, editor and writer for a computer magazine, said he planned to vote against the government because `` I do n't think they have achieved much.'' He calls the nuclear question `` a joke.'' `` That's not the issue,'' he says. Indeed, Danish elections have focused mainly on economic issues since World War II.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who has sought to improve relations with <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, discussed human rights and economic issues Tuesday with the highest-ranking Bulgarian official to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since World War II. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, minister of foreign economic relations, outlined Bulgarian plans to improve its economy and told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> his country was eager to increase trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through joint ventures, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks were `` cordial, relaxed and businesslike.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reminded <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about Bulgarian treatment of its Turkish minority, the official said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and others have accused <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> of seeking to force assimilation on 900,000 people of Turkish origin. Under a 1975 law, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and other Soviet allies remain ineligible for special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariff reductions _ most favored nation status _ as long as their emigration policies are deemed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be restrictive. In practice, a nation's entire human rights policies are scrutinized before a decision is made on most favored nation status. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has sought to join <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> as Soviet-bloc countries eligible for the benefits, but the request has been denied. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the issue was not raised with <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, who is the first Bulgarian politburo member to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> became a communist country following World War II. `` This was basically an overview of relations, rather than a detailed discussion of economic issues,'' the official said. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> traditionally has taken its economic and foreign policy cues from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its recent moves to improve efficiency and add marketplace approaches to the economy have mirrored similar efforts by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> also has sought to increase the amount of high technology it is permitted to buy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will include a trip to the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> region known as <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> because of its numerous high-tech industries and to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Southern Illinois City Struggles As Coffers Near Empty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST St. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local officials are scrambling to avert a financial crisis as a $ 230,000 payroll comes due Friday with only $ 884 in the city's bank account to cover it. Officials of this financially strapped Southern Illinois city laid off 25 city employees on Monday and the treasurer's office was closed for the day in cost-saving measures. But Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who lost all her regular workers in the cutback, said the layoffs might not save enough money to keep the city solvent. `` They laid off my administrative assistant and two accountants,'' as well as four other workers, said Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` They did n't leave anyone in here.'' She said an expected infusion of money from state sales-tax receipts may not provide enough cash to cover the city's debts, which include the $ 230,000 city payroll, a $ 29,000 monthly garbage contract and a monthly $ 29,000 payment on a $ 3.4 million lawsuit judgment. Disputes over payment for garbage pickup and the recent court judgment have added to the woes of this economically depressed city. Officials have said they must trim about $ 144,000 a month from the budget to keep the municipality from going bankrupt. To help Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s office function, three workers from other departments were transferred into the treasurer's office. But Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said she was unhappy with the transfers, which replaced accountants and account clerks wth clerk-typists and reference clerks. Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and City Clerk <PERSON> Alzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, who lost one of her three employees to the layoffs, said they were to meet with their attorneys to determine whether they can take legal action to prevent the gutting of their offices. Ms. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said the loss of her deputy reference clerk _ one of those transferred to the treasurer's office _ kept her from being able to fill all the requests for city documents received Monday.

 A federal court jury found today that <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> did not steal an unknown reggae musician's song and turn it into his 1985 hit, `` Just Another Night.'' Fans in the courtroom broke into applause after the verdict, and <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> said he planned to celebrate by having a beer with his lawyers. `` My reputation is really cleared. If you're well-known, people stand up and take shots at you. It's one of those things in a litigious society,'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> told reporters. The six-person civil panel had listened to tapes of both <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s song and one written in 1979 by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, 36, which is also named `` Just Another Night.'' `` I still believe and I know that's my song,'' said <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, 36, who had accused <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> of copyright infringement. Shortly before issuing the verdict, jurors asked for a rereading of the law on access. They were apparently trying to determine whether <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> could have heard or known about <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song prior to writing his own. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s lawyers said <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> made $ 6 million from the song, which appeared on an album called `` She's the Boss.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, looking weary, had testified Monday, rebutting a statement by <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s attorneys that longtime collaborator <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> tended to write the music while <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> handled the lyrics. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> was gracious to fans throughout the trial, but pushed angrily through a mob as he left the courthouse Monday night. Crowds waiting to see the rock legend broke a door at the small courthouse, according to security officials. Two alternate jurors, dismissed when the jury began deliberations, said they also would have found for <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>. `` I think he did it independently,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION>, who found <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> to be a `` gentleman... He's completely different than what I thought from his videos.'' Her children, ranging from 16 to 25, are fans.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that school reforms pushed by his administration had brought `` truly revolutionary'' changes to American schools, including a new emphasis on discipline and homework that is paying off in better results. `` We still have a long way to go,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said after Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> presented a progress report on the schools. `` I'm confident this report will help us find the way.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held a White House ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s biting critique, `` A Nation At Risk,'' that spawned efforts in nearly every state to raise academic standards and the pay and performance of teachers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the earlier report, commissioned by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s predecessor, T.H <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, `` helped heighten and acclerate a wave of education reform in states and communities all around the country.'' He said it led many states to install career ladders and merit pay for teachers, and many schools placed `` a new emphasis on quality and discipline, more homework, more attention to basic skills.'' `` This was truly revolutionary after two decades in which money had been the only measure of progress in education and in which while federal spending on education went steadily up, test scores fell steadily downward. Too many schools accepted the fashions of the day, fashions of liberal culture that held traditional standards in scorn,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Earlier, 350 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> members rallied in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> across from the White House to protest the report. Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., drew applause when he called <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` the secretary of ignorance. <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s report was an attempt to `` whitewash'' the administration's failure to fulfill its obligation to help improve schools. `` American educatioan can be made to work better and it can be made to work better now,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the 200 people gathered in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> of the White House. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> was not invited to the ceremony. Eight of the 18 members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> did attend, including <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, who said afterwards of the <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> report, `` It was timely, helpful, tended to be constructive. I believe it could have been written in a more positive fashion. ... I also think it was short in terms of the role the federal government ought to be playing.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in presenting the report to the president, `` American education has made some progress in the last few years. ... But we are not doing well enough, and we are not doing well enough fast enough. We are still at risk.'' `` If our schools are to improve, the powerful resistance to reform must be overcome. ... The nation's modest success over the past five yers is both proof of reform's possibilities and a summons to renewed effort,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` I guarantee you we will seize the opportunity to elect a pro-education president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> in addressing the protesters. `` Only then will we have a secretary of education more interested in leadership than in showmanship.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> was one of the few major education groups not invited to the ceremony. `` A Nation At Risk'' made headlines and laid the groundwork for moves in `` I think it's an excellent report, a good summary of what progress has been made and also of what remains to be done,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said he wished the report had given greater emphasis to `` what the federal government should be doing,'' especially on the `` horrendous problem'' of 40 percent dropout rates for minority youths. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` If Secretary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and the president really feel that the nation is still at risk, they ought to propose something that the federal government does to get us out of this mess other than just preaching at everyone else.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s report said: `` American education has made some undeniable progress in the last few years. The precipitous downward slide of previous decades has been arrested, and we have begun the long climb back to reasonable standards. `` We are doing better than we were in 1983. But we are certainly not doing well enough. ... We are still at risk.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` He does n't recognize that we've made these gains at the same time we've admitted over 2 million non-English speaking immigrant students to the school population ... -LRB- and -RRB- in the face of growing numbers of poor families. `` He does n't recognize the fact that we're fending off the drug pushers with one hand from the community and trying to teach them with the other.''

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Helps Economy Grow By 2.3 Percent In First
Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Strong spending by American consumers helped the economy grow at a healthy 2.3 percent annual rate during the first three months of 1988, the government said Tuesday, dispelling fear of any lingering ill effects from the October stock market crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in its first look at overall economic peformance this year, said consumer spending, the biggest surge in business investment in more than four years and growing exports kept the gross national product rising despite declines in government spending and housing construction. `` So much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the first quarter,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON>. `` ... Whatever the impact -LRB- of the crash -RRB- was, it's pretty much behind us.'' `` I think these are uncommonly good GNP numbers,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. Early this year, economists had feared the evaporation of $ 500 billion in wealth during the Oct. 19 stock market crash would scare consumers, whose spending represents two-thirds of the economy, and cause a drastic slowdown or even a recession. But as signs of strength accumulated through the quarter, most analysts began expecting moderate growth about in line with what was reported Tuesday. Interest rates on bonds, which likely would have risen on news of stronger-than-expected growth, showed little reaction to the GNP report. The economy had expanded at a much faster 4.8 percent rate in the October-December quarter, but most of the increased production went into inventories and consumer spending actually dropped. That combination often presages a recession. Manufacturers, faced with a backlog of unsold goods, cut production and lay off workers. However, consumer spending rebounded by $ 23.6 billion in the first quarter, a 3.8 percent annual rate of increase, with more than half of that growth coming in auto sales. In turn, business inventories, which had risen by $ 39.4 billion in the fourth quarter, fell by $ 13.2 billion in the first quarter. <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said automakers are now well positioned to increase production, adding 1 percent or more to second quarter GNP. Business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual rate of 32.5 percent in the first quarter, the fastest advance since a 39.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983. Much of the strength there came in computers. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing that the big boost in capital spending should help ease inflationary pressures. As manufacturers in industries running at almost full capacity expand their factories, production bottlenecks and resulting price increases gradually will become less likely, he said. The rate of inflation as measured by the GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the January-March quarter, down from a 2.7 increase in the fourth quarter. `` The economy is on track for moderate further expansion and for restrained inflation in 1988,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said. In other good news, the country's trade deficit, after removing the effects of inflation, narrowed by $ 3.6 billion in the first quarter, continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid-1986. However, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said an increase in imports, although slower rate than the rise in exports, was troubling. Exports rose 10.2 percent in the quarter, while imports rose 5.2 percent. `` The problem with trade remains too many imports. Americans are not yet buying American,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. The administration, which is looking for a sixth straight year of economic growth to boost chances for a Republican presidential win in November, has forecast that GNP will grow 2.9 percent for the full year. The administration is counting on further improvements in the trade deficit to supply almost half of the growth. Much of the rest is expected to come from higher business capital spending as companies expand to meet a growing export demand. In another report, the government said that after-tax corporate profits rose an even faster 2.6 percent in the final three months of 1987. This was an upward revision from a month ago, when the government put the increase in business profits at 1.6 percent. Two factors that held back GNP growth in the first quarter were a 9.4 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 22.3 percent drop in spending by the federal government, reflecting in large part a swing in farm subsidy payments. The various changes pushed the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, up by $ 21.8 billion, to a new annual rate of $ 3.90 trillion.

<HEAD>Administration Asks High Court to Scrap Special Prosecutor Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to scrap a federal law used to prosecute several former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides and to investigate Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The law gives too much power to people `` totally untethered to any politically responsible person,'' argued Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top courtroom lawyer. Disputed provisions in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 allow independent counsels, formerly called special prosecutors, to investigate alleged misconduct by key executive-branch officials. Fried said such investigations should be conducted only by officials answerable to the president. Independent counsel <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, defending the law, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted to `` preclude the appearance or the reality of a conflict of interest'' arising from an administration investigating itself. The high court's decision, expected by July, could help define the nation's political life in future years. The decision also could affect the criminal convictions of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and the Iran-Contra affair prosecutions of <ORGANIZATION> ex-White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> is investigating allegations that <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, a former assistant attorney general, lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 during a dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup program for toxic waste sites A federal appeals court ruled the independent counsel law is an unconstitutional encroachment on the president's power to enforce criminal laws. Fried urged the justices to uphold the appeals court ruling, saying the law `` strips the president of a purely executive function _ criminal prosecution.'' He said the law also wrongly `` absolves <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of its weightiest and most painful duty'' _ serving as a watchdog for abuses of executive power. Fried said the proper remedy for such misconduct is impeachment by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, added that the law `` radically alters the structure of how we are governed.'' Joining Ms. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> in defending the law during a 90-minute argument session was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s chief lawyer. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> fielded questions from several justices who voiced concern about the law's empowering a special court, rather than the president or his subordinates, to appoint special prosecutors. He said such appointment power is a minor aspect of the law. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> seemed less than convinced. `` You can not assign to one branch certain functions that inherently belong to the other,'' he said. But <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s lawyer, why the special-prosecutor provision was dissimilar from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> routinely placing limits on a president's power to remove one of his executive-branch appointees. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, `` Should n't a prosecutor be independent? What's wrong with it?'' The case is being decided by eight justices because Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has disqualified himself for unexplained reasons. His absence creates the possibility of a 4-4 tie, which would have the effect of automatically upholding the appeals court decision invalidating the law. Asked by reporters whether that possibility concerned her, Ms. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> would not comment, saying only, `` I will anxiously await the court's ruling.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he did not expect an evenly divided court. `` I think a consensus will emerge, and I do n't expect a 4-4 split,'' he said. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was convicted of perjury earlier this year for lying to a grand jury and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and two others were indicted in special prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation of the Iran-Contra affair. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who successfully prosecuted <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> for illegal lobbying, also is investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in connection with possible financial conflicts of interest.

<HEAD>San Francisco Rationing Plan Would Limit Use And Raise Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An emergency water rationing plan under consideration in the city would close down decorative public fountains and prohibit restaurants from giving water to customers unless they ask for it. The second phase of the proposal by the city's <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would require each resident and business to pay a higher rate for less water by the end of May. The conservation plan, which will be considered Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, would begin Sunday. It would allow each home or business a water allocation based on a 25 percent reduction of the amount of water it used in 1987. Washing down sidewalks or patios with drinking water would be prohibited under the plan. Fountains, including those in Civic Center, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> and the Villiancourt Fountain near the Ferry Building, would be shut off. Washing a car with a hose would be prohibited unless the hose has a shut-off valve. The increase, which has not yet been determined, would accompany penalties for using more water than the allocation. The city will also consider placing flow restrictors on water lines in homes or businesses that do not cut use. Water rationing is necessary because of two dry years in a row, water officials said. Last week's rains did little to increase runoff from melting snow in the <LOCATION> Tuolumne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> watershed, where the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area gets most of its drinking water. Runoff was 34 percent of normal as of Monday, officials said. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> would be the second water system in the area to impose rationing. The <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> last week adopted a flat daily allocation of 400 gallons for its 1.1 million customers.

<HEAD>Seven Indicted For Allegedly Bilking $800,000 From Coin Investors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A company used a videotaped appeal from famed test pilot <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON> and the promise that profits from its sales would fund a veterans park to lure investors into losing $ 800,000 in a fake medallion scam, prosecutors said. The 37-count federal indictment, issued last week and unsealed Monday, names seven individuals and two companies, Can-Am Mint and <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which had offices in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Vets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was incorporated in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> but shared offices with Can-Am. `` Many of these victims are very elderly people and a number have lost members of their families in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ericksen </PERSON>. `` They are an extremely vulnerable group of victims.'' Among the victims, one elderly <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> man sent in $ 81,000 and received nothing in return, <PERSON> Ericksen </PERSON> said. In all, she said, about 45 investors from as far away as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were involved. The indictment alleges that since March 1986 the defendants tried to induce veterans and other investors to buy 3-ounce silver commemorative medallions for $ 99 each, and promised that the medallions would increase in value by 12 percent in a year. Only a few of the investors received the medallions, <PERSON> Ericksen </PERSON> said. The investors were assured that half the profits would be used by Vets for Vets to fund a veterans park near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, according to the indictment. The defendants allegedly told investors that 70 acres had been donated for the park and that groundbreaking would take place on Memorial Day 1987, according to the indictment. The government claims that no land was donated or bought for the park and no park had been built. <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> general and the first pilot to break the sound barrier, withdrew from the project after a short time, <PERSON> Ericksen </PERSON> said. `` It sounds like a really good idea,'' she said. `` You sell these medallions, build a park in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, honor these veterans _ I can see why his agent would be interested in this.'' `` Obviously, shortly after he got involved with these folks he figured out what was up and he withdrew his support,'' she said. He got involved because `` he was simply lied to,'' she said. A woman answering the telephone in <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said he was out of town and not available for comment. A telephone call to the Can-Am Mint and <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> office was answered by a recording saying the number had been temporarily disconnected at the customer's request. A call placed to the number given for Vets for Vets did not go through. `` It looked legitimate,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellingson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Inver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, who said he agreed to buy 10 medallions at more than $ 80 each after doing some videotape editing and duplicating for one of the defendants' companies. `` Their offices had the fanciest of furniture, the biggest of layouts,'' he said. `` They kept calling me back and saying, ` <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>, you're going to miss the market. ... These things are really soaring.''' Charged with numerous mail fraud counts are <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, 39, who is in custody in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on unrelated fraud charges; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sannes </PERSON>, 43, of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Burnsville </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kesler </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Burnsville </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheatham </PERSON>, 40, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krzyzaniak </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The indictment says <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> was the president of Can-Am, <PERSON> Kesler </PERSON> was the company's director of administration and <PERSON> Sannes </PERSON> was president of Vets for Vets. <PERSON> Kesler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> appeared last Friday before a federal magistrate and were freed after each posting 5 percent of $ 50,000 bail. <PERSON> Ericksen </PERSON> said she will ask that <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION> be transferred from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The three remaining defendants were not in custody as of Monday, according to federal officials.

<HEAD>Gulf Convoy Turns Back, Apparently Due to Bad Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers moved into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Tuesday for the first time since last week's clash with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but the vessels turned back, reportedly because of bad weather. One source, an official close to the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> which owns the tankers, said another attempt to move the ships might come within 24 hours. Shipping executives said a sandstorm reduced visibility in the central gulf to less than two miles, thereby limiting the ability of mine-hunting helicopters and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels to detect mines. They said that although two `` mine danger areas'' had been cleared by American and other mine sweepers in recent days, there still was too much risk in sending ships into the area without adequate mine-hunting protection. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said he could provide no information on any convoy activity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> customarily does not confirm the movements until they have passed specific danger points in the gulf. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking privately, earlier had conceded there was growing concern over the freeze in convoy movements that followed the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> navy frigate and the subsequent U.S.-Iran skirmishes. The 3,700-ton guided missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> ran into a mine on April 14. Ten crewmen were injured in the blast. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated four days later with a series of attacks on Iranian targets in the gulf. During the day, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or damaged six Iranian naval craft. After the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> incident, more than a dozen mines were found and destroyed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British, Dutch, Belgian and Italian mine hunters in that area. French warships destroyed mines in another area 70 miles away. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they still were trying to identify the type of missiles fired at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships during the April 18 battles. Officers aboard the ships identified them as Chinese-made Silkworms, but military officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said that had not been confirmed. British and French convoys were reported to have passed through the `` mine danger area,'' but the source close to the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil firm said the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> convoys would not move until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials were satisfied that the mine and missile threat was under control. The 11 Kuwaiti tankers, reflagged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year for protection from Iranian attack, operate on a fairly tight schedule in delivering petroleum cargoes to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s long-term contract customers, mainly in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A two-tanker convoy that had been scheduled to enter the gulf April 15 was canceled, and four more ships arrived within days at the convoy staging area off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON>. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offcer called it an `` unprecedented traffic jam.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had denied last week that the escort operations had been suspended. The ships at <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON> included the 401,283-ton supertanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, which had been slated to make one of its infrequent trips into the gulf since it was hit by a mine on the first convoy last July 24. The others were the 46,723-ton Gas Queen, scheduled to move with the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, and the oil products carriers <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, 294,739 tons, the <LOCATION> 81,283-ton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, both 79,999 tons. A seventh tanker, the 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier Gas King, was stranded at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, awaiting clearance to sail south.

<HEAD>Cold, Wet Weather Slowing Spring Planting</HEAD>

 Cold, wet weather has slowed spring planting and crop development in a large part of the nation's farmbelt, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday. `` Precipitation slowed planting in the central and southern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and Southeast,'' the facility reported. `` The cold weather slowed wheat growth in the northern and central <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and Corn Belt.'' Dry conditions continued to hamper winter wheat growth in the northern Plains, while disease and insects were the main problems in central areas. The facility, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments, said corn planting was about 15 percent completed in the major producing states by April 24, ahead of the 11 percent pace of a year ago and the long-term average progress of 9 percent by this time. `` Planting was under way in all states except <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` Seeding surpassed the average in nearly all states, -LRB- although -RRB- below-normal and sometimes freezing temperatures slowed planting in some Corn Belt states.

<HEAD>Benefit Increases Double Over Past Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pay raises are continuing to grow rather than diminish for the first time this decade, with benefit increases doubling in size overall in the past year and tripling for blue-collar workers, the government said Tuesday. Wage and benefit increases for the 12 months ending in March averaged 4.1 percent, compared with 3.4 percent during the previous 12 months, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Over-the-year gains of 3.5 percent in basic wage rates for non-union workers in private industry exceeded those of union members at 2.6 percent, continuing a trend that has dominated most of the decade, the department said. But when benefits are included, that gap narrowed considerably: a 4 percent total compensation gain for non-union workers versus 3.9 percent for those who belong to unions. And in the rebounding manufacturing sector, union members with combined wage and benefit gains averaging 5.5 percent outpaced non-union workers with an average increase of 4.2 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said. The government data reflects what analysts and labor negotiators for both businesses and unions have been seeing as a growing demand for more untaxed benefits rather than taxable wage increases despite nominally lower tax rates. Just last month, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union were told by 180,000 members to take back a contract just negotiated with the trucking industry and swap some of the pay increase for bigger employer contributions to health and pension plans. Benefit increases in the past 12 months have averaged 5.8 percent overall in private industry, double the 2.9 percent rate during the previous 12 months, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s statisticians said Tuesday. And among blue-collar workers, benefit cost increases to employers have nearly tripled _ from a 2.3 percent gain a year ago to 6.8 percent that past 12 months. In manufacturing, the average benefit increase the past 12 months was 7 percent, compared with just 1.5 percent a year ealier. The government said the bulk of the accelerating benefit increase is represented by escalating health insurance costs with a smaller portion coming from increased Social Security contributions by employers. `` Some of these benefits have turned into entitlements, and just like the government, a lot of businesses have lost control of them,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belous </PERSON>, an labor economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business research group. `` For a while, it looked like many employers were containing health care costs but in the last year a lot of the solutions such as increased outpatient care and requiring second opinions before surgery have unraveled,'' he said. `` With mandatory health insurance on the horizon, a lot of companies are going to have to go back to the drawing board.'' However, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalusky </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, said much of the difference in the benefit increases between union and non-union workers can be explained by the stock market crash last October. `` Union employers tend to have defined benefit pension plans, which means that when the market crashed, they had to put more money into the kitty,'' he said. `` Non-union employers have switched more to defined contribution plans in which the beneficiaries absorbed the brunt of the crash.'' <PERSON> Zalusky </PERSON> agreed that unions are emphasizing non-pay items more at the bargaining table, such as profit-sharing, bonus and employee stock ownership plans that do n't show up in the government's collective bargaining or employment cost figures `` The worker retraining programs negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T now constitute the largest privately endowed education program in the country,'' he said, `` and they are nowhere reflected in the data.'' In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said first-year pay increases in major union contracts negotiated the first three months of 1988 averaged only 2.1 percent, excluding cost-of-living adjustments -LRB- COLA -RRB- and lump-sum bonuses. However, excluding the 20 percent who agreed to wage freezes _ often in exchange for profit-sharing, stock ownership or bonus arrangements _ the average increase under the new contracts was 2.7 percent, the department said. Including the <ORGANIZATION> COLA </ORGANIZATION> payments and lump-sum or profit-sharing bonuses from other, older contracts, the average effective wage increase over the past 12 months under collective bargaining agreements has been 3.8 percent, the government said. That compares favorably with both the 2.4 percent effective wage increase a year earlier for union members and the 3.5 percent gain the past 12 months for non-union workers. Earlier government data showed that union workers last year maintained a roughly 36 percent wage advantage over non-union workers _ $ 465 a week vs. $ 342 in 1987.

 A collection of the personal scrapbooks, tape recordings, published and unpublished sheet music of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` Duke'' <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> was presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday by the son of the late composer-orchestra leader. `` We've come to perpetuate <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> as a composer,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> said. `` Personally, it gives me the satisfaction of knowing we have located Ellington in a place of posterity. `` We will come to see him take his place among the other great composers of note, such as <PERSON> Debussy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> said. `` There is also the fact that a black American was able to achieve this without having to go anyplace else. He got it at home.'' Acquisition of the 6,000-item collection followed three years of negotiations with the <LOCATION> Ellington </LOCATION> estate and a special congressional appropriation of $ 500,000, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>. The collection will be housed in the jazz section of the museum's division of musical history. He said about half the funds would be used to preserve the older manuscripts, some still stored in brown cardboard boxes. The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> also plans to sponser performances of Ellington's previously unknown works and issue an unspecified number of publications featuring articles from the collection. `` We have produced many good songwriters in this country,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, cultural historian of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` But he was much more than that _ he was a composer-orchestrator. `` It is on those accomplishments that he receives the respect that he has ... as a major figure in 20th century music,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The author of several Smithsonian jazz books, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the collection offers `` Ellingtonologists'' the opportunity to examine the original sheet music of the Duke's classics, including `` Satin Doll,'' `` Mood Indigo'' and `` Caravan.'' All other sheet music of <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s works had been transcribed from old recordings and tapes, he said. `` To Pop the best song was the one he was writing at the time,'' <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> said, noting that his father had written some rock' n' roll songs from his rhythm and blues times <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> also told of the time when his father put together a be-bop group called The Spacemen. `` He never excluded himself from any generation.''

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Tuesday after agreeing with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> to work for a strategic alliance against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> on Monday to try to end a five-year feud between two of the Arab world's most influential figures. <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s political department, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would return to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> soon, after `` the foundations for a common action'' had been laid in the 3 -LCB- - hourt meeting with <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> also said that a summit meeting grouping <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> probably would be held next month in either the Libyan or Algerian capital. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also met for one hour Tuesday with Vice President <PERSON> Abdul-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> before leaving for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> aboard a special plane. He later told reporters his talks in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> were `` useful and will have positive results on the Palestinian and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> levels.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Sunday and visited the grave of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s deputy who was gunned down April 16. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief was accompanied on Tuesday's flight to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, better known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, his No. 2 man in <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream faction and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s power base. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> left <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> and other aides behind to work out the details of a new Syrian-PLO alliance. In an interview after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s departure, <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` have agreed to work together in a joint struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace -RRB- plans.'' That was a reference to a peace plan presented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> last March. Under the peace plan, Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would be granted limited self-rule. Palestinians in those territories have been rioting against the Israeli occupation since Dec. 8. Both <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> rejected the plan and insist on settling the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> problem through an international peace conference that would lead to the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> said there was `` complete harmony'' in the stands of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on this issue. He said `` the uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> is our -LRB- Syrian and PLO -RRB- first concern. We agree that all our efforts should focus on bolstering the uprising and rallying support for it.'' <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief diplomat, said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have worked out details of their new alliance before an extraordinary Arab summit meeting tentatively set for early June in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. He said both leaders hope they will go to the summit `` with identical views on all issues, if not a common working paper.'' <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Natsheh </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> central committee member who attended the talks in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had solved most of their problems.

 Your bank cash machine has gone berserk, giving out $ 20 bills as if they were fivers, yet your receipt shows no sign of overpayment. Do you: a. -RRB- Use the emergency telephone to alert the bank. b. -RRB- Take the money and run. c. -RRB- Call your friends to get down there, too. If you chose the first option, you are a rare breed of cat, judging from an unintentional ethics experiment staged Sunday at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> bank branch. Because some hapless employee loaded a canister of $ 20 bills into the slot for $ 5 bills, the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>'s branch at First Avenue and 14th Street launched an accidental exercise in income redistribution. Although the cash machine panel has a 24-hour telephone for reporting problems outside bank hours, the response was not overwhelming _ `` one or two calls,'' according to bank spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>. Instead, a line of eager card holders quickly formed at the machine. `` I called everybody I knew,'' a writer, who asked not to be identified for fear of prosecution, told <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. An actor named <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, who asked for $ 40 and received $ 160, was amused by the range of reactions: `` One person let out a holler of joy. Another barely raised his eyebrows and sneaked out. One woman went into a tirade about how she's getting back at the bank for money it owed her.'' Nor did guilt apparently set in later. The bank received only one call on Monday reporting Sunday's malfunction. `` I was really surprised the gentleman called,'' admitted <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Saavedra </PERSON>, the branch manager. The most a customer could ask for was $ 200 _ and get $ 800. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said that although the bank's audit was not finished, it appeared the automated teller overpaid a total `` somewhat less than $ 5,000.'' <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said the bank was not dismayed by its customers' eagerness to profit from the foul-up. `` I would n't want to characterize them all,'' he said of the customers. `` I think some individuals were innocent recipients of the machine.'' He said First Federal would learn the identities of those who reaped windfalls, once it determined how much was lost and who was making withdrawals during the time the machine was in the giving mood. `` We'll be able to determine who requested what, and what they really got,''' <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said, adding that customer accounts would be automatically charged for the amount overpaid. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district attorney's office said bank customers might be subject to prosecution for larceny. But it was unclear whether the bank would be able to prove that all the bills in the $ 5 slot were really $ 20s. Bank cash machines in the city typically hold about $ 100,000, according to banking industry experts. Overpayments like Sunday's are said to be extremely rare `` It's much more common for the reverse to happen _ a customer is shortchanged,'' said <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Love </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, an industry newsletter. `` But we estimate these kinds of problems only occur in about one-twentieth of 1 percent of all -LRB- automated teller -RRB- transactions.''

<HEAD>Soviets Leave Mobile Without Sister-City Certificate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet delegation that came to Mobile seeking a sister-city bond departed in frustration Tuesday after their weeklong visit to the port city turned diplomatically chilly. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON>, who spearheaded the sister-city proposal after a trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year, said the Soviet mayor and two city council members from <LOCATION> Rostov-on-Don </LOCATION> were `` hurt and distraught'' by their rejection. But the visitors enjoyed their tour of the Gulf coast, said <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON>, a librarian and archivist for the city who has written a book on his travels in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> titled `` Fast train <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>.'' Mobile Mayor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Outlaw </PERSON> said at the outset he disapproved of the proposed sister-city agreement and the proposal never received a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> vote. Thus, the proposal died without official consideration Tuesday. `` I do n't see what can be gained by relations between an appointed government and an elected government that responds to the will of the people,'' Outlaw said while attending a welcome reception for the group last week. The visitors included <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Balashov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Tupchenko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gennadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorenko </PERSON>, and translator <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Khokhlova </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Crommelin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said members of the <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION> group were likely Soviet agents. `` It is well known to be standard operating procedure for all Soviet delegations, of whatever type, to have at least one-third <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> GRU </ORGANIZATION> agents as members, both to prevent defection and to gather intelligence,'' <PERSON> Crommelin </PERSON> told The Mobile Register. He also suggested that the sister-city link could be proposed to gather military intelligence on the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base at Mobile and nearby <LOCATION> Ingalls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, Miss. `` That sounds absurd,'' <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Higgenbotham </PERSON> was a member of a group of residents from Mobile that visited the Soviet city last year and arranged for the exchange. He said the <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION> officials `` came over trying to make a good impression.'' <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON> said Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> had declared the visitors honorary citizens of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. But he said they left thinking something they had said or wore provoked the rejection by Mobile officials. `` It was a little pitiful,'' <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON> said.

 An upbeat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> met with his family for two hours Tuesday and was optimistic that his conviction and death sentence on Nazi war crimes would be overturned, relatives said. But an official at the prison where he is being held said guards were ordered to put the retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker under suicide surveillance. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, was returned to solitary confinement in the maximum-security <LOCATION> Ayalon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> on Monday after being sentenced to death for executing hundreds of thousands of Jews as the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> guard `` Ivan the Terrible.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who insisted he was innocent throughout the 14-month trial, plans to appeal to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> prison service spokesman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tester </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was placed `` under 24-hour guard, and we are asking his guards to be more careful, more alert. We want to be prepared in case of a suicide attempt.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the precautions were `` a bunch of baloney.'' `` They're going to pop up with that kind of stupid propaganda to try to make it seem like he might kill himself out of remorse or guilt,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 22, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` My father would never attempt something like that because he's innocent and he'll fight this to the last minute,'' the younger <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Maday </PERSON>, 38, said her father was cheerful Tuesday during the family's first meeting since he was sentenced to die. `` We definitely get our strength from him. You keep thinking when you go in there you're going to have to pump him up and it's just the opposite,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Maday </PERSON> said `` He's prepared to move on and get ready for the appeal.'' She said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who was extradited to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from his suburban <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> home, told the family he bore no animosity toward the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> judges or the 650 spectators who clapped and chanted `` Death! Death!'' when the sentence was announced. `` He's not vindictive. There's no hate,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Maday </PERSON> said. `` He just said it's a shame that people have to rejoice in someone else's sorrow. You just have to overlook it. A lot of people did n't feel that way. Mrs. <PERSON> Maday </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a devout <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, cited passages from the Bible and said `` Christ was spat upon and villified and yet he turned the other cheek. My dad says he's another innocent victim and he can take it too.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the defense would not file an appeal for several weeks, until after the family returns home to map a strategy. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was convicted April 18 of being the sadistic guard who helped operate the gas chambers at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where 850,000 Jews were killed. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who lost relatives in the Holocaust, praised the sentence. `` All of us are proud that a Jewish tribunal in the Jewish state has judged and condemned one of the cruelest war criminals who murdered many of our Jewish brethren and relatives,'' the Polish-born <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. Some Israelis saw the 14-month trial as a crucial opportunity to educate the younger generation and remind the world of the horrors of the Holocaust. `` The personal fate of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is n't important or very interesting,'' <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commentator and Holocaust survivor, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` The importance of the trial was to remind us of the Holocaust. For most of humanity the Holocaust is cloudy history.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, seeking to spotlight southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the presidential campaign, went to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday to discuss Mozambican rebel atrocities and to say <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> should be treated as a terrorist state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pointed to a new report by a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> consultant that said the rebels in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have killed 100,000 civilians and engaged in systematic murder, beating, mutilation, rape, looting, burnings and abductions. The Democratic presidential contender said South African support for the rebels amounts to `` state-sponsored terrorism'' and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should provide security to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s neighbors. He met with top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, including Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, for a briefing on the report, which was compiled by a department consultant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gersony </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, joined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at a news conference afterward. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said there is `` a pattern of continuing contact between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>,'' the rebel group, and he said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s involvement goes against a 1984 treaty it entered with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> denies having supported the rebels since that time. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> used the <PERSON> Gersony </PERSON> report to underscore his call for a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the `` frontline states'' around it. He called on Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to join him in calling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should pass legislation `` clarifying its meaning of state-sponsored terrorism to specifically include <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Poison-Laced Grapefruit Spurs Nationwide Seizure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health officials on Tuesday began seizing all grapefruit on sale in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> after some pieces of fruit believed imported from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were found laced with a powerful poison. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> ordered the nationwide seizure of all grapefruit on sale and and in warehouses after health officials in the <LOCATION> Lazio </LOCATION> region, which includes <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, reported that poisoned grapefruit was found in a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> supermarket. Italian news media said the grapefruit apparently was imported from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but officials said they could not immediately confirm where the fruit originated. Last week, an organization that said it supported the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> claimed to have poisoned Israeli grapefruit on sale in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. It called for a boycott of Israeli products. Laboratory checks at the time found no trace of poison. The claim was made by a caller to a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> newspaper who said he was speaking on behalf of the `` Organization of Metropolitan Proletarians and Oppressed People,'' a group that was not known to have existed. Of the 12 grapefruit on sale at the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> supermarket, six were found to have been injected by syringe with a bluish poison. The substance, which was not identified, was so powerful that it killed laboratory mice instantly. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rome </ORGANIZATION>'s poison center reported receiving calls from three <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> residents who said they had eaten grapefruit with blue marks on Monday or Tuesday. `` So far none of them has reported any ill effects,'' said Professor <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Malizia </PERSON>, head of the department. Israeli-grown `` <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION>'' grapefruit in cellophane wrappers is sold widely in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Israeli Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Granot </PERSON> promised to cooperate with Italian authorities to determine whether the grapefruit poisoning was `` an isolated case, a gesture of a madman or a terrorist act.'' `` It is certainly a criminal act,'' he said. <PERSON> Granot </PERSON> said an expert from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> was on his way to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to help in the investigations. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said there was at least one precedent for the poisoning. It reported that oranges and grapefruits from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were poisoned with mercury in several Western European nations in 1978. There was no claim of responsibility. The news agency reported that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> imports about 23,000 tons of grapefruit from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annually. The figure represents about half of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s total import of grapefruit. In 1987, grapefruit imports from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were valued at an estimated $ 13.2 million. Owners of the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> supermarket where the poisoned grapefruit was found said they had sold about 36 <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> grapefruit the day before the contaminated ones were taken for testing on April 20. Supermarket clients said two or three youths were distributing pamphlets near the store last week urging customers to boycott <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> goods, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported. They said a poster affixed on a wall outside the supermarket said, `` Do n't buy <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> grapefruit. <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON>.''

<DATELINE>CEBU CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>

 Troops on Tuesday fought military deserters who have formed a religious cult on a small island, and seven people were killed, the military said. After the battle, dozens of former elite <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> remained holed up with about 600 civilians in a standoff on <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about 300 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. A renegade leader said he needed more time to convince his men to surrender, according to a mayor involved in the negotiations. Four government troops and three deserters were killed in Tuesday's predawn clash. Local radio stations said one civilian also died. The fight broke out when deserters, who took refuge on the island in 1986 and formed their religious cult, attacked a military checkpoint set up to prevent them from leaving their hideout, military officials said. <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Patalinhug </PERSON>, mayor of nearby <LOCATION> Lapu-Lapu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, met with the leader of the renegades to tell him to give up. Sgt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabandeja </PERSON> promised to ask his men to surrender but said he needed more time, the mayor said. About 600 civilians were staying with the deserters, maintaining they were willing to die with them, the mayor said. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermosa </PERSON>, regional military commander, said he called off a planned attack on the deserters Tuesday to allow officials more time to negotiate. `` The outlaws have many conditions which are not acceptable,'' <PERSON> Hermosa </PERSON> said. `` Their surrender would be unconditional. They should face the consequences.'' He said military operations would resume Wednesday. <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION> has vowed to capture the 30 to 50 renegades, who moved to <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> after deserting their unit on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island. The military claims the renegades have been involved in smuggling. Also on Tuesday, suspected communist rebels gunned down a police captain and an anti-communist vigilante in two separate attacks outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, officials said. Police said two men armed with .45 - caliber pistols shot and killed <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, deputy police commander of <LOCATION> Mabalacat </LOCATION> town, as he drove late Monday near the sprawling military base. Hours later, a lone gunman killed <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabile </PERSON>, a member of a vigilante group, while he played cards with friends in neighboring <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. The military also said 17 communist rebels were killed when government troops stormed a hideout in the northern province of <LOCATION> Kalinga-Apayao </LOCATION> on Saturday.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Chiefs to Meet on Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers open a two-day conference Wednesday to keep their policies in line with superpower efforts to cut nuclear weapons. The meeting comes amid internal strains between much of the Western military alliance and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, which has moved to strengthen its longstanding ban on peacetime nuclear weapons. This week's talks were originally supposed to take place in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, but they were moved to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in reaction to the Danish initiative. In addition, the ministers will grapple with West German fears about <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to modernize short-range nuclear arms. The Germans think such a move could make them a more likely target for Soviet aggression. However, this week's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting is not likely to yield major decisions, alliance officials say. It is instead intended to review long-range nuclear arms planning. It will be the first defense ministers' session since the Dec. 8 signing of the U.S.-Soviet accord to eliminate two classes of ground-launched medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing the treaty. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was expected to brief ministers at the meeting on preparations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for an elaborate, 13-year inspection system to check compliance with the treaty. However, ministers will likely discuss the whole range of arms control negotiations, said a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. That would include reviewing superpower efforts to sign another accord to cut their strategic nuclear arms by 50 percent, or 6,000 on each side. Hopes have faded of completing such a treaty by May 29 when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meets <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The defense ministers will review their long-term nuclear arms planning in light of the goals <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has set for itself in recent years, said allied officials. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has 4,600 nuclear warheads in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, down 2,400 since 1983. The stockpile is at its lowest in 20 years, said one <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official. The alliance is studying adjustments to its nuclear deterrent through modernization and redeployment of arms without raising the total number of warheads. The studies deal with developing a new short-range Lance ground-to-ground missile, a battlefield air-to-ground missile, and improved nuclear artillery shells. The issue of modernizing short-range nuclear arms, most of which are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, has also caused internal <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> friction. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> fears that as medium-range missiles disappear under the intermediate-range treaty, improved short-range arms would make its soil a greater target for Soviet attack. It prefers short-range nuclear arms talks in tandem with conventional talks, due to start in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> this fall. But its allies say the short-range arms must still be modernized by the mid-1990s. Ministers will also probably discuss <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s proposal to notify individual warships of its longstanding ban on nuclear weapons. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers have warned that such a move could threaten Danish participation in the alliance. The <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> will vote on a new parliament May 10 in what Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> has called a referendum on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Arizona Governor Says She'll Amend Disclosure Forms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. Rose Mofford, who gained office after former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was accused of misdeeds that included failure to disclose a campaign loan, has acknowledged that she did not report some land, loans and partnerships of her own. `` I still question whether the law requires that these items be disclosed,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who as secretary of state for 10 years was charged with accepting state officials' financial disclosure statements. `` But I wish to avoid even the appearance of impropriety,'' she said, promising to file amended statements. `` <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> has been through enough without additional doubts and nitpicking.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, a Democrat, was elevated to the governor's office from secretary of state April 4 after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, on two impeachment counts. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did not vote on a charge that he failed to disclose a $ 350,000 campaign loan, an issue on which he is to stand trial May 19. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> has said he believes such items as land, loans and partnerships are reportable, and an aide said Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s filings would be reviewed by his office. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said that if Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> is allowed to get off the hook by amending her statements, he should be treated the same way. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> laughed Monday and said `` I love it'' when he heard Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s statement about `` doubts and nitpickings.'' Lawmakers said they would prefer to leave matters in the attorney general's hands for now, but some left open the possibility of another legislative investigation like the one that led to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment. `` We'll just have to wait until the <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> says,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who initiated the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` I just hope she gets everything fixed up.'' The existence of the land holdings, loans and partnerships was discovered by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> through interviews and records in the <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Recorder's office, the state <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the secretary of state's partnerships office. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who divorced her husband T.R. Mofford in 1967 but remained on good terms with him until his death in 1982, said she undertook most of the ventures on behalf of him or his estate and therefore felt no need to report them. Others were of such a minor nature that she felt they did not need to be reported either, she said. `` I'm not trying to hide anything. Everything's on my income taxes,'' she said, adding that the ventures on her former husband's behalf did not result in any financial profit to herself Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said she would ask <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> to determine if the items should have been included on her disclosure forms `` so that his advice can be available to her and to other public officials faced with questions,'' her office said Monday in a written statement. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> was out of town Tuesday, but chief assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Twist </PERSON> had said Monday that <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office planned to review records of the transactions. `` Under the circumstances now, it would not be appropriate or us to give any personal advice to the governor,'' Twist added. State law requires officeholders to list any source of compensation totaling more than $ 1,000 in a single year and any title to or beneficial interest in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> real estate other than the officeholder's primary residence or primarily recreational property. It also requires disclosure of any business, partnership or joint venture in which the officeholder is involved, and debt of more than $ 1,000 owed by or to the officeholder and any gift above $ 500. It is a misdemeanor to file an incomplete or false financial disclosure statement and a felony to swear intentionally to a false statement. The statements are filed with the secretary of state's office. Two instances Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has not listed in any of her yearly reports involved land acquisition in 1978. In one, the Moffords and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Foudy </PERSON> bought a one-third interest each in land from <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>. The land was sold about 18 months later, and the Moffords and <PERSON> Foudy </PERSON> held a $ 25,000 note. T.R. Mofford and <PERSON> Foudy </PERSON> had died by the time the buyers fell behind in payments, and in 1986 Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foudy </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, filed suit. An out-of-court settlement paid them more than $ 21,000 in a lump sum, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Foudy </PERSON> said in an interview. In the other 1978 transaction, the Moffords and <PERSON> Foudy </PERSON> acquired individual interests in land from <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>. Mofford turned his share over to Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foudy </PERSON> turned his share over to his son. Records also indicate that n50 percent participation with him in a $ 20,000 loan in 1983 and her 26-plus percent paticipation with him and others in a $ 45,000 loan in 1984. Also unreported was Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s participation as a limited partner in Tempe-Motorola Properties and West Broadway Properties. In addition, the size of other land and partnership holdings is under-reported, and there are apparent discrepancies in acquisition dates.

 The government will put new visa procedures into place to make it faster and easier for foreign entrepreneurs, scientists and technicians to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, an official said Tuesday. The streamlined rules beginning Sunday are part of broader reform of Soviet economic and foreign policy, <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Avramenko </PERSON>, first deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s consular directorate, told a news briefing. `` The new procedure for entry into this country reflects the logic of the course of Soviet foreign policy, which is oriented toward active development of economic, scientific and technical contacts with Western and developing countries,'' he said. Under leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviets have been wooing foreign investors, proposing joint projects with firms abroad and seeking to use Western capital and expertise to revitalize the state-run economy. For years, securing an entry visa to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been a time-consuming affair, with delays that often stretched into months. Starting Sunday, however, it will be the practice of Soviet consulates abroad to issue visas within 48 hours to foreign business people, technicians and scientists who already have established contacts with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Avramenko </PERSON> said. He said foreigners would need an invitation from a Soviet firm or governmental agency in order to receive quickest attention. However, others who desire to explore economic or professional opportunities may still gain a visa at Soviet consulates within about five days, <PERSON> Avramenko </PERSON> There will also be a `` maximum broadening'' of the granting of multiple entry visas, documents valid for two or three years that allow bearers to enter and leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as often as they want, the diplomat said.

 Political leaders eulogized Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> Price Tuesday, saying the 22-term <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman was a friend of the common man and a model for other leading <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> politicians. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told about 1,000 mourners at the <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> that Price `` epitomized the best of that misused and sometimes abused profession'' of politics. `` He was not fashionable, not flamboyant,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` He helped the humble, the powerless, those who have no voice. He was their voice. He was their strength and he asked nothing for it.'' Price, 83, who died Friday of pancreatic cancer, had planned to retire in January at the end of his 22nd term. The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> Democrat had served <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' 21st District since 1944 and was the second most senior man in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after 24-term Rep. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Mass.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration affirmed its determination Tuesday to push a $ 460 million arms purchase by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> through a reluctant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the argument that enhancing AWACS radar planes is essential to protect <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. A bipartisan group of 187 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members has written Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> opposing the sale of advanced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equipment in light of the Saudis' recent secret purchase of missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that could devastate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 58 members are on record against the deal. But <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> had given assurances the missiles would not be nuclear-armed and had decided to sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Under the accord, states without nuclear weapons agree not to make or acquire them. `` We have not changed our view that the AWACS maintenance package is critical to our gulf policy,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> told reporters. `` The Saudi AWACS operation provides important support for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in the gulf, including protection of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel and equipment.'' American warships are protecting U.S.-flagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers in the war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A number of clashes with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> resulted above the <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hormuz </ORGANIZATION>, through which cargoes pass. The area is patrolled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radar planes, with the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> AWACS </LOCATION> _ or <ORGANIZATION> Airborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> _ aircraft confined to the southern region, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week in a secret briefing. In the south, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces are under threat of Silkworm anti-ship missiles <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> purchased from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The decision to sell new equipment to the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> sets the stage for a debate May 9, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is due to hold a hearing on the nomination of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The missiles <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sold to the Saudis are capable of carrying nuclear or chemical warheads and have a range of about 1,600 miles. They add to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security concerns that were heightened last year when <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> obtained missiles from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that also could rocket Israeli population centers with deadly chemical weapons. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said 186 other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members had signed a letter he wrote urging <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to withdraw the proposed sale. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had not replied yet. But, the spokesman said, `` we expect to go forward with the formal notification in the near term.'' When that step is taken, the deal will go through unless both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to reject it within 30 days. `` The Saudis have assured us that their missiles would not be nuclear-capable,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` By adhering to the <ORGANIZATION> NPT </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -RRB-, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> would further obligate itself not to develop or acquire nuclear devices.'' The spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was concerned about the proliferation of missiles throughout the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> _ not just with the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> purchase from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We remain fully committed to providing the necessary support to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for the continued operation of the AWACS,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` It is in the national security interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to conclude this deal.'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said signing the nonproliferation treaty `` is certainly a welcome move.'' But, he said, `` it does not diminish congressional concerns.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said `` the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles, even without nuclear warheads, pose a real threat to the security of the entire region, in part because they are easily equipped with chemical warheads.'' He added: `` The fact that the missiles were acquired under a cloud of deceit only heightens our concern.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was expected to announce a break in diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in response to Iranian attacks on shipping in the gulf According to an informed source, who requested anonymity, the Saudi council of ministers took the decision at a meeting Monday night. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, like most of the Arab countries, supports <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, already protecting 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, may extend the protection to neutral shipping. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> confirmed Monday at a news conference in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> that a decision was under consideration.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Schools Are Improving With Return to Basics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday that American schools are on the mend thanks to a restoration of discipline, homework and basic skills, but `` we still have a long way to go.'' At a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the landmark `` A Nation At Risk'' report, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said a new critique from Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` will help us find the way.'' But outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, several hundred teachers rallied in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to protest the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policies and heard Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., call <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` the secretary of ignorance. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the school reforms pushed by his administration have brought `` truly revolutionary'' changes to American schools. He said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, whose 1983 report warned of a calamity approaching from `` a rising tide of mediocrity'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools, `` helped heighten and acclerate a wave of education reform in states and communities all around the country.'' He said it led many states to install career ladders and merit pay for teachers, and many schools placed `` a new emphasis on quality and discipline, more homework, more attention to basic skills.'' `` This was truly revolutionary after two decades in which money had been the only measure of progress in education and in which while federal spending on education went steadily up, test scores fell steadily downward. Too many schools accepted the fashions of the day, fashions of liberal culture that held traditional standards in scorn,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The key to what works is not money or being in a prosperous neighborhood, but establishing a direction ... setting standards,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the bottom line of his report, `` American Education: Making It Work,'' is that `` American education has made some progress in the last few years. ... But we are not doing well enough, and we are not doing well enough fast enough. We are still at risk.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told a news conference that the educational establishment is criticizing his report because `` they want a whitewash of the problem and they want a blank check.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the 1.8 million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told the teachers at the protest, `` I do n't want a blank check. I want him to sign it.'' She charged <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was `` whitewashing what the administration is doing by coming out with another report that basically says they're not doing anything.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, a liberal Republican who has battled against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> efforts to cut education spending, said, `` On the basis of the fact that you get what you pay for, Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is not the secretary of education, he's the secretary of ignorance.'' The education budget today is $ 21 billion, compared with $ 14.8 billion seven years ago. But <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sought $ 19 billion in cuts in the last five years. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> and other speakers said Head Start and the Chapter One remedial program reach only a fraction of the youngsters eligible for the services. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, standing beneath a banner reading, `` 1983: A Nation at Risk. 1988: An Administration Asleep,'' said, `` The time has come for Secretary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to get out of the grandstand and into the game.'' Two-hundred people attended the ceremony in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, including eight of the 18 members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Commission chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s report `` was timely, helpful, tended to be constructive. I believe it could have been written in a more positive fashion. ... I also think it was short in terms of the role the federal government ought to be playing.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> added, `` But I think the conclusion was correct, namely we have a long way to go.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told reporters afterwards the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> remains `` greatest single obstacle to education reform in the country.'' `` I am not surprised that they were picketing or demonstrating there across the street, because they have been demonstrating against education reform since the very beginning,'' he said. `` I have re-evaluated my view of the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> and each time I re-evaluate it, it's worse.''

 Scores of workers toiled Tuesday to rescue waterfowl from a 21,000-gallon oil spill that officials say could leave a major wildlife area damaged for years and cost at least $ 1 million to clean. `` Now we're looking at a dead marsh,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, an officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` Do n't get your hopes up for the next few decades.'' The oil caused the greatest damage to a marsh area in <LOCATION> Suisun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, although a lighter slick extended about 10 miles west through the <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The marsh area, 35 to 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, is the most prized wetland of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a major stopover along the migratory bird route that extends virtually the length of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Directed by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter, six oil skimmers were deployed to the worst oil slicks, and vacuum pumps worked day and night to suck oil out of the marshes. The unrefined crude oil leaked from a storage tank Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> refinery. The company has acknowledged responsibility for the spill. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s tab for cleanup costs could exceed $ 1 million, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Qaulity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s regional assistant executive. In addition, the company also is likely to face penalties and other costs, including damage to bottoms of numerous pleasure boats, he said. Under state law, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> could face $ 210,000 in fines _ $ 10 a gallon _ and more if the state attorney general's office files a successful lawsuit. `` The cleanup could continue for days to weeks,'' said <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>. `` The damage may be there for years.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game official <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said about 200 soiled but living birds have been collected for treatment, and some 75 birds have been found dead. Biologists said the spill also threatened nests. The marshes are home to dozens of species of birds including egrets, avocets, grebes, sandpipers, ducks, herons, teals and the endangered clapper rail bird, as well as salt marsh harvest mice, tortoises, muskrats and otters.

<HEAD>Austin Urged to Rename Bowie High</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hispanic and black leaders are urging <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> school officials to name a new high school after someone other than <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> hero <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, arguing that <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> was a slave trader. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> chapter, said <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> is n't the kind of person whose name should be on a school. `` The plain and simple truth, according to some of the most noted <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> historians ... is that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> smuggled slaves into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, sold them at vastly inflated prices, owned then, sold fictitious land grants for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> land, fraudulently sold land owned by his in-laws and committed many other heinous and nefarious acts,'' <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> said. Black and Hispanic leaders have suggested naming the school after a Hispanic. No Austin high school has a Hispanic namesake. The Daughters of the Republic of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and 420 other people recommended that the school be named for <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>. In a March vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> approved <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>'s name for the school with two board members dissenting. For the matter to be reheard, a board member who voted in favor of <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>'s name must move for reconsideration. No such motion was made at the panel's latest meeting Monday. A <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> native, <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> was an adventurer who by age 18 had earned a reputation for riding alligators and wrestling bears. In 1828, he moved to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and settled in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. After first sharing command at the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> fell ill and died on March 6, 1836, when Mexican soldiers captured the mission. A county and a city in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are named for him. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and others sent a letter complaining of the name choice to the school board April 11.

 The armed forces began slashing active-duty strength in March to accommodate budget cuts, paring almost 19,000 positions from the ranks during the month, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. As of March 31, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> had 2,143,129 men and women on active duty, down 18,727 from the 2,161,856 reported Feb. 29 and 25,051 below the March 31, 1987, total. All four services reported declines in personnel during March, although the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s drop was relatively minor, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reported 594,660 personnel on active duty at the end of March, down 8,939 from Feb. 29.

The candidacy of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is black, represents an important and moving moment in history, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for a luncheon at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s proposals would cost billions of dollars, resulting in higher taxes and reducing employment instead of helping the poor, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. In addition, he went on, there is a question of character focusing on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown.'' What if a Republican contendor referred to <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, as `` coontown?'' asked <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. `` I ca n't imagine the other Republican candidates even appearing on the same television platform with someone who said that.'' `` How can Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ask for our votes when he lacks even the courage to condemn a man who calls Jews `` Hymies?'' asked <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. And he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was far from the only silent Democrat. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> also said the governor was not responsible for the economic upturn in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in recent years.

<HEAD>19 Arrested For Stealing Telephone Access Codes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nineteen people were arrested for allegedly stealing telephone access codes and selling them to hundreds of customers at a cost to five long-distance carriers of $ 4.5 million in fraudulent phone calls, the government announced Tuesday. The 19 people obtained credit card numbers and access codes from computer hackers using specially designed programs to search phone systems for workable codes, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> caught the 19 in an eight-month undercover operation in which a secret service agent operated as an illegal distributor of codes through his own <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> company called <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>, known to the users as the Coconut Connection. `` These people ... hacked out these access codes using computers, and then sold the stolen codes through illegal multilevel marketing schemes,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON>, in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` Hundreds of people throughout the country bought these stolen access codes ... for $ 100 to $ 150 per month for unlimited long-distance service,'' <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> added. During the undercover operation, agents made more than 600 phone contacts with people involved in marketing access codes and received from those who were indicted more than 600 illegally obtained codes, reported the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It is the largest probe of telephone access code devices in the industry's history. <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 3 million as a result of the schemes and `` we would have lost at least 10 times as much if not for the success'' of the undercover operation, said <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Wnorowski </PERSON>, senior vice president and general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents sold some <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint long-distance access codes to track the extent of the illegal operations, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bent </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Bent said those indicted were `` high-level distributors'' of telephone access codes. After the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> provided one distributor a code, within four days it accumulated $ 73,600 in illegal charges. Four federal grand jury indictments were handed down April 14 in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> as a result of the operation, but were sealed until the arrests began Monday. The theft of telephone access codes is a `` recent phenomenon, in the past three or four years we've seen it blossoming,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Godbey </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a long-distance phone clearinghouse, says losses from all types of access device fraud at half a billion dollars annually for the $ 40 billion a year long-distance telephone industry.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> farm where the `` pumpkin papers'' that led to the perjury conviction of <PERSON> Alger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> were hidden should not be designated as a national historic landmark, an advisory panel said Tuesday. It was the <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> case in 1948 that vaulted a fairly obscure young congressman named <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to fame. The recommendation of the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> could be overruled, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said. The board, meeting in Harpers Ferry, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, made the recommendation on the grounds that 50 years have not elapsed since the events that gave the site significance, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> The principal significant event was the retrieval of microfilm from a hollowed-out pumpkin for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, then a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Un-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, by the owner of the farm, a <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> editor named <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>. Chambers had accused <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, of being a fellow member of a communist spy ring. <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> sued Chambers for libel, but <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' production of the filmed <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> documents he said <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> had given him in 1938 led to <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON>' conviction for perjury for denying to the committee that he had handed over the documents. The park service generally follows a policy of letting a 50-year interval lapse to make sure history has gained enough perspective on events for fair designation of landmarks, <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> said. `` It is not a hard and fast rule,'' he said. The secretary of the interior, who makes such designations, has the final say and may overrule the board, <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> noted. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, hinted strongly that <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> might do just that.

Chambers' testimony before the committee and his 1952 autobiography, `` Witness,'' strongly influenced a generation of conservatives, among them President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who awarded a posthumous Medal of Freedom to Chambers in 1984. The case was a watershed in American life, with many people becoming convinced by it that communists had targeted American life and institutions for damage, if not for takeovers, and others refusing to concede either a threat from communism or the guilt of <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, served 44 months in prison. He maintains his innocence. Chambers died in 1961. Designation as a landmark carries no obligation and no reward other than a plaque. Some 1,800 sites nationwide have been made landmarks.

<HEAD>Police Commissioner To Koch: Apologize For Jackson Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said Tuesday that Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> ought to apologize for his `` divisive'' attacks on <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, the city's first black police commissioner and a Koch appointee, said the mayor's acknowledgement that he had been left `` bloodied'' but unbowed by the uproar surrounding his criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not suffice as an apology. `` It's not enough to say ` I'm bloodied.' ... It's not a time for more people to get bloodied! If you're bloodied, maybe you need <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nightingale </LOCATION>. You do n't need somebody else with a bat and a hatchet,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> told reporters at City Hall. At an appearance in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> offered an apology for hurting black people's feelings but stopped short of saying he was sorry for his remarks. `` When you ask me about blacks and their sensitivity, I'm sorry that I injured their feelings but I will try to redress that as best I can,'' he said. `` Not just with words but with programs.'' He said his new budget on May 9 would include housing, health and education programs aimed at helping <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s blacks. Asked if these programs were evolving because of the harsh criticism to which he has been subjected, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who has said he plans to run for a fourth term next year, replied, `` Oh, sure. Absolutely.'' During the campaign, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stand on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and said Jews and other supporters of that nation would be `` crazy'' to vote for him. He also said he thought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s positions on national spending would bankrupt the country, that his defense policy would disarm the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that he had `` lied'' about his actions the night the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was assassinated. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said he did not know <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s intentions in making those remarks. `` But, whatever the mayor thought he was doing ... I'm here to tell him, and I think the whole city community, black and white, is saying that, ` It did n't come out right, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>. And it has a divisive tone to it. And there is a time for some healing and consensus playing that this city really ca n't afford what's come out of this. And enough is enough and times is tough.'''

 A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily enjoined the merger of two of the nation's leading spice manufacturers pending <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> review of the proposed deal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> granted an <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> request to stop the scheduled completion on Friday of <ORGANIZATION> McCormick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Chemical warfare is being waged on larger scale than ever in the Iran-Iraq war, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report released Tuesday. The report does not say who has been using the outlawed weapons. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have accused each other of launching chemical warfare attacks in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war The report could prove a disappointment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has been urging the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for practicing chemical warfare. Investigations in past years confirmed that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons. In releasing the 26-page report, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> expressed his `` deep sense of dismay and foreboding at the mission's conclusions that chemical weapons continue to be used in the conflict ... and that their use in recent days has evidently been on an even more intensive scale than before.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts examined victims in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and concluded most were suffering from exposure to mustard gas, a World War I-era agent. A few had been exposed to a nerve gas, the experts said. The team said they examined 39 Iraqi victims, all military personnel, and 66 Iranians, both soldiers and civilians. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims Iraqi victims were exposed to poisonous gases used by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on enemy troops. Dr. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, the head of the team, said `` the use of yperite -LRB- mustard gas -RRB- was unmistakably confirmed.'' <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> is a colonel in the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> army who specializes in nuclear, biological and chemical weapons injuries. Even though the report did not lay blame, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it was satisfied. `` It definitely bears out our contention that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used chemical weapons,'' said <PERSON> Mudhafar </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Amin </PERSON>, counselor to the Iraqi mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Iranian officials refused to comment. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team spent three days in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and three days in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, examining victims in an Iraqi military hospital in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and at several facilities in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said that because of `` security reasons,'' the team did not visit the Kurdish border town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says thousands of civilians died in Iraqi bombardment on March 16-17. In a 1987 investigation, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts collected weapons fragments from the scenes of chemical warfare attacks to analyze them to determine their origin. That investigation pointed the finger at <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In the most recent study, the team did not gather weapons fragments. However, the experts said they were shown shrapnel from bombs dropped on an Iranian village on March 29. The report said the shrapnel `` was observed to bear markings in Cyrillic,'' the alphabet used in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main arms supplier.

<HEAD>Committee Sends Aviation Liability Bill to Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee on Tuesday approved a measure sought by the small aircraft industry that would place limits on accident liability. The measure, which was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on a voice vote, would establish a series of federal standards for determining liability in an accident involving aircraft seating less than 20 people and that are not flying scheduled passenger routes. The measure would replace what industry officials and private plane owners complain is a hodge-podge of conflicting state laws. Manufacturers argue that their insurance costs have multiplied by 500 percent since 1981. As a result of that increase and rising court judgments, the number of private planes produced in this country has declined from a record 17,000 in 1979 to 1,085 last year, the industry says. The bill would place no limit on the amount of money a victim could recover in damages. But in perhaps its most controversial provision, it would prohibit accident victims from obtaining damages in most cases in which the aircraft was more than 20 years old. Consumer groups and trial lawyers have opposed the legislation, contending it would make it too difficult for victims to collect damages and thus eliminate an incentive that manufacturers have to make the aircraft safe. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee approved a similar bill March 3 that would limit manufacturers' liability to aircraft 12 years old or less. But the measure faces bleak prospects in that chamber because three full committees _ <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> _ must complete work on the legislation before it reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel sent the bill to the full chamber, with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> objecting. The Oregon Republican complained that the measure would make it too difficult for passengers aboard aircraft involved in accidents to prove the plane was defective. The measure is sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., whose state is home to <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and other private plane builders

<HEAD>Daughter: Mom Talked Of Copying Tylenol Poisoning Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, accused of killing her husband and a second person by putting cyanide in Excedrin capsules, had discussed copying the Tylenol poisoning case in which seven Chicago-area people died, her daughter testified Tuesday. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said her mother suggested the 1982 Tylenol episode `` would be very easy to re-enact,'' safer and less expensive than hiring a hit man or other ways Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had discussed for killing <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON>, who led <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> through two hours of tearful testimony, asked her to explain. `` In her -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s -RRB- own words, it would have been ` easy because they were looking for looking for people shoplifting and taking things from the store ... not for putting something back,''' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. The testimony occurred in the seventh day of the nation's first trial of anyone charged with causing death by tampering with over-the-counter medicine. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> case has not been solved. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, who was <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s stepfather, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, of suburban <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, both died in June 1986 after ingesting Excedrin capsules containing cyanide. Prosecutors say the effort by Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, to make the two deaths look like random killings began to unravel when her daughter went to authorities. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 28, frequently sobbed as she described how her mother discussed at least four ways of killing <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, who died in what prosecutors say was a plot to collect insurance money. Government investigators found Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s fingerprints in library books about poisons, and at least one insurance policy in <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s name was forged, prosecutors say. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said that at first she did n't think too much about what her mother was telling her. She was an intelligent woman who collected information on a wide range of subjects, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said of her mother. But gradually, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said, her mother began mentioning <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> more often during the conversations. `` I know my mother very well, and basically, I knew she was capable of it -LRB- murder -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> sobbed on the witness stand. `` But I was hoping she would n't.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said her mother discussed hiring a hit man, but dismissed the idea as too expensive, and contemplated slipping him cocaine on the theory that authorities would conclude that <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, a recovering alcoholic, had switched from alcohol to drugs and had accidentally overdosed. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> related that the cocaine `` could be put in his tea. It basically could n't be tasted in iced tea,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> quoted her mother as saying. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> made one failed attempt to poison her husband by placing black seeds that she believed were toxic in capsules, and giving the capsules to <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> along with his morning vitamins and orange juice, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said her mother also asked her how much heroin was needed for an overdose, but never linked that question to her repeated tales of dissatisfaction with <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>. When her mother initially asked about buying heroin and other drugs, `` I thought she may have possibly been thinking about acquiring it -LRB- heroin -RRB- to supplement her income,'' she said. `` I just could n't picture my mother selling drugs,'' she said.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> announced Tuesday it was breaking diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and asked Iranian Embassy officials to leave the kingdom within a week.

An informed source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Saudi council of ministers made the decision at a meeting Monday night. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, like most of the Arab countries, supports <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in its 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and oil-rich <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> have been at odds since the riots in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> on July 31, 1987 that killed 275 Iranian pilgrims and the subsequent ransacking of the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> by mobs. A Saudi diplomat later died of injuries sustained in the attack. The Saudis said a total of 402 people were killed in a stampede after a political demonstration by the Iranians turned violent. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> police caused most of the casualties by shooting into the crowd. Mecca, the birthplace of Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, site of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s tomb, are the holiest places for the world's 850 million Moslems. They are located in a western <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> region known as Hijaz.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying `` we can not pause too often to give thanks to mothers,'' declared May 8 Mother's Day in a proclamation released Tuesday. `` Maternal love is the first tangible bond any human being knows. It is a tie at once physical, emotional, psychological and mystical,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The mark of motherhood ... is a devotion to the well-being of the child so total that it overlooks itself and its own preferences and needs. It is a love that risks all, bears all, braves all,'' the proclamation said. `` As it heals and strengthens and inspires in its objects an understanding of self-sacrifice and devotion, it is the parent of many another love as well.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` generation after generation has measured love by the work and wonder of motherhood. For these gifts, ever ancient and ever new, we can not pause too often to give thanks to mothers. `` As inadequate as our homage may be and as short as a single day is to express it ... Mother's Day affords us an opportunity to meet one of life's happiest duties.''

 The Soviets have shown a `` single-minded attitude'' in improving submarine communications and may lead the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in developing powerful signals, a military publication said Wednesday. The 1988 edition of <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> said, however, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was generally believed ahead in research into laser-aided submarine communications, the most advanced form.

The manuel said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ahead in the less powerful of such signals, those that penetrate down to nine yards. It said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was also leading in finding ways to use laser transmitters carried on board satellites to relay messages to submarines from shore installations, aircraft or surface vessels.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 16-1 Tuesday to subpoena the private working diaries of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in its continuing investigation of international drug smuggling. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., expressed concern that the originals of the North diaries have never been turned over to government authorities in uncensored form but remain in the hands of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and his attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> The subpoena calls for North and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to produce 2,848 pages of handwritten diary notes in their entirety and with no deletions. The notes cover the period from September 1984 until November 1986 when <PERSON> North </PERSON> was fired from his position on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the Iran-Contra arms and money furor. A version of the North diary already has been made available to the congressional Iran-Contra committees, but <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> heavily censored 1,269 pages with black ink. Speaking of the North diaries, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> told the committee: `` I'm not asserting that there's a smoking gun or something hidden or that some of the redactions -LRB- deletions -RRB- are not appropriate My assertion is that given what has already been declassified, I do n't know how we can proceed with our investigation without being able to see all of it `` The issue is one of investigation,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` Should we have the right to look at these classified documents, a work product of a government employee?'' Seventy-four pages of North's notes were released Tuesday. Often interspersed in notations about logistics of the war effort of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels are numerous references to drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents. But <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> complained that most such references are preceeded or followed with large blacked-out sections. One note dated June 27, 1984, says, `` Drug Case _ DEA progress on combatting cocaine,'' and refers to possible <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> negotiations to move drug refining to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. An entry from the previous month notes that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Latin American chief <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarridge </PERSON> had called and indicated that `` -LRB- name deleted -RRB- contact indicates that <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> is involved with drugs.'' It is unclear to whom `` Gustavo'' refers. A July 24, 1984, entry states: `` Clarridge: -LRB- paragraph deleted -RRB- _ <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ Get <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> on drugs.'' The passage's meaning is unclear. <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> is the son of a former member of the directorate of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION>, at that time the Contra political umbrella. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, now a member of the Contra political directorate, was at the time associated with the southern front in the Nicaraguan civil war, which was at odds with <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> has made clear he believes there was a connection between drug running and efforts to supply and arm the Contras. Some testimony before his subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism has focused on that possibility. Contra leaders, however, have denied involvement in drug trafficking. Censored versions of the diaries originally were provided to the congressional Iran-Contra committees under the grant of limited immunity from prosecution given to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> in exchange for his testimony before the panel last year. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said that in order to speed up the process the Iran-Contra panels permitted <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to block out sections they deemed to be irrelevant to that investigation. But <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nields </PERSON>, chief counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee, said there were many sections that appeared to be `` very relevant'' to the <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> narcotics investigation. And he made public a letter in which Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee, said: `` I share your belief that the portion of the diaries which was withheld from the select committees may contain important information relevant to your inquiry.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s law office here had no immediate comment on the subpoena or on whether he and <PERSON> North </PERSON> would comply with it. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said he was `` prepared to go the distance'' in pursuit of North's diaries. `` If they resist, it will seem to me that there is even more reason to believe there is something there that we have to see.'' North is facing trial on federal charges in the Iran-Contra affair, but <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said he had been assured by the staff of Iran-Contra independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> that making the documents available to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would not interfere with the prosecution. North and three co-defendants were indicted by a federal grand jury on March 16 on conspiracy, theft and wire fraud charges centering on the secret sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the alleged diversion of the proceeds to the Contras. Additionally, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was named in nine separate counts for allegedly obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> making false statements, obstructing justice and a presidential inquiry, destroying official documents and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Only Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, voted against issuing the subpoena, saying he did so because he believed that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a personal friend, already is bearing a too heavy legal burden.

<TEXT>
 Rival television shows about wanted fugitives have led indirectly to the arrests of one man on <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> embezzlement charges and another on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rape-murder charges, and both were ordered held without bond Tuesday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, 40, was arraigned Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, for being a fugitive from justice. He refused to waive extradition to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials said they will seek the death penalty on rape and murder charges. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, who had been living in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for three years under the name <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, is charged with embezzling $ 1.1 million in 1983 from the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where he worked. He appeared before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Asked by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> police if he was <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, `` he answered, ` Yes, I am.' There was a big sigh of relief and then he said, ` I'll cooperate fully however I can,''' said Police Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Friendswood </LOCATION> Both men were arrested Monday, when television programs featuring them had not yet been broadcast. Stark's photograph appeared on television in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> for 15 seconds Sunday night on a promotion for the April 30 broadcast of <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted.'' Five people called police and said they recognized him. <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> was scheduled to be featured in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries'' on May 6. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it sent out wanted posters on him to aid authorities in anticipation of public tips and inquiries generated by the program. A copy was seen by <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who had had his eye on the free-spending <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> for some time. `` There was no doubt in my mind it was him when I saw the flier,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` I was shocked. I probably have 600 pages of reports on this guy from the last three years, and he looks the same.'' Stark was ordered held without bail pending another hearing on May 26. <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> was ordered held without bail pending a bond hearing Friday. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> authorities had issued warrants charging Stark with the May 1, 1987, slaying of a teen-age hitchhiker in Banning and a Feb. 24 rape in <LOCATION> Hemet </LOCATION>. Stark, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> Yucaipa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, allegedly shot the still-unidentified teen-age girl when she tried to escape from him at a service station in Banning, 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, whose investigation led to the warrant on the February kidnapping-rape, said <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> had been convicted three times of kidnapping and sexual assault and had spent `` almost all the time between 1971 and 1985 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prisons and a mental hospital. He'd get out and do it again.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> police arrested Stark on Monday at his car wash job after the telephone tips. <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> was reported missing by his wife and family in July 1983, the same time the $ 1.1 million disappeared from the credit union. He called home to alert his wife to a letter he left behind. In part of the letter included in federal court documents, <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> wrote to his wife, `` If I call you to read this letter, it means that I have successfully left the state with around $ 1 million from the credit union.'' His first wife later divorced him, and he remarried. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and police called <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, 40, and asked him to come to the police station Monday to discuss a neighborhood juvenile case that <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> and his new wife had reported, then confronted him with the poster. After arriving in <LOCATION> Friendswood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> obtained the birth certificate of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, who died after birth in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in February 1948, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. With the birth certificate, he got a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' drivers license and a passport. The `` Unsolved Mysteries'' segment that led to <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>'s capture still will be broadcast May 6, and will include an update of his arrest, said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, field producer with <ORGANIZATION> Cosgrove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meurer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, criticizing news coverage of his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, said Tuesday that reporters were more interested in `` gossip and nit-picking'' than in covering the issues. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader, said in a floor speech that overall coverage of the 1988 presidential primaries was `` issueless and negative.'' The senator from <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> said a predominantly liberal press corps gave <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidates `` far more negative treatment than the Democratic candidates.'' `` What I witnessed generally on my own campaign plane was an aircraft filled with reporters who became each other's best audience,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` It was an ultrainsider's game of gossip and nit-picking that turned presidential campaign coverage into ` Trivial Pursuits.''' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> cited a recent <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> newspaper study he said showed `` network television coverage of the 1988 presidential campaign has focused 80 percent of its time on everything but issues.'' `` There was coverage of all kinds of gossip and ` horse race' stories, and judging from my own experience, who's on or off the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign plane, which reporter will find that one person in a friendly audience who can serve up a juicy negative quote, and on and on and on. He said the media were more interested in `` putting political gossip above information, and titilation above education.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates received more negative treatment than Democratic candidates. `` Something is out of whack _ and something is disturbingly unfair _ when news coverage becomes so slanted, and the issues get lost in the daily hype,'' he said. `` Look at the news rooms,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Let's face it, they tend to be liberal. In all honesty, how many Republicans are out there covering the candidates? Or Congress? I do n't think I could guess more than a carload.'' `` Reporters try to be objective,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` But try as they do, they just ca n't help but see the world through liberal colored glasses.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said his audiences wanted to know where he stood on individual issues. `` Unfortunately, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are not getting what they want, at least from the news media,'' he said. `` It's a shame the media ca n't keep up with the people,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will not reach agreement on a way to reduce acid rain emissions before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration leaves office, a senior administration official predicted Tuesday on the eve of a visit by Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. The official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, denied that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed during a meeting with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> last April to commit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to specific targets and timetables for the reduction of emissions. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, in a conversation with American reporters in the Canadian capital on Friday, said he was disappointed with the administration's lack of action against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> smokestack emissions that he says are killing lakes and damaging forests north of the border. And the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, in a booklet distributed in advance of Wednesay's meeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, said, `` <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> can not solve the problem on its own. ... <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is taking action and we expect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to do likewise.'' Meanwhile, 19 senators, including six Republicans, released a letter they had sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urging him to reach agreement with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> at the meeting on the environmental issue. `` It would be most fitting for you to end your last summit meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> with an agreement to control acid rain,'' the letter said. The senators, most of them from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, included <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, principal author of a clean air bill awaiting floor action, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s agreement to seek a bilateral accord with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on the issue was inserted, during his meeting with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, in a speech the president made later in the day at the Canadian parliament. The official, who was present at the meeting, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has n't changed his mind'' about trying to reach an agreement. But the official said that when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later proposed an accord, `` it did not meet what <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> apparently wanted in this specific area, which is targets and timetables.'' `` I am not aware of any time that the two leaders agreed that the accord would include targets and timetables,'' the administration official said. Instead, the official said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> agreed to `` try to find a bilateral accord that moved us ahead a little, but we have n't been able to.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> proposed a draft treaty calling for a 44 percent reduction in estimated northbound flow of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant from coal-fired power plants and other sources that provides a key raw material for making acid rain. Of about 23 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sulfur dioxide emissions, about 4 million tons flows north across the border _ an amount <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> proposed should be limited to 2.2 million tons. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> did agree two years ago that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should pursue a $ 5 billion, five-year demonstration effort to move `` clean coal'' combustion technologies into commercial use in a way that would reduce pollution flow across the boundary. Though <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has cooperated in providing the government's half share of the money, few projects are under way yet and environmentalists criticize the program as little more than a pork barrel for the coal and utility industries. Asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would be able to reach agreement by Jan. 20, when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration leaves office, on an approach that will significantly reduce acid rain, the official said: `` No, I do n't. It is a difference in approach.'' `` If you are going to put a lot of money into something, you had better make sure you have the right technology,'' the official said. `` You had better know there is a direct relationship between what you are doing and where the acid deposition is coming from.'' When asked whether this meant the administration considered the problem too costly to tackle, the official said, `` It is too dear if you are using the wrong technologies and when you get all done you have n't solved the <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> problem. People are just simply very reluctant to say, ` Here we go full tilt,' and when you get done you have n't solved the problem as it addresses itself in the U.S.-Canadian relationship.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> violated its treaty with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in its attempt to close the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The court, which has no enforcement powers, sided with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> issue must go to independent arbitration. It rebuked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for its efforts to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sought a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal court order to close the mission after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed new anti-terrorist legislation in December. Under the law, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is classified as a `` terrorist organization'' and is prevented from operating on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court has not yet acted. The world court president, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruda </PERSON>, reading from the 25-page opinion, said the closure proceedings violated a 1947 pact between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that assured diplomats unhindered access to the international organization. That accord, called the the Headquarters Agreement, calls for arbitration in such disputes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected arbitration. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government maintains that the anti-terrorist law is exempt from `` any international legal obligations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have under the Headquarters Agreement.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration move against the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presence has been condemned by all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member nations except the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carl-August </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary-general for legal affairs, told reporters after Tuesday's ruling that he was not optimistic that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would submit to arbitration. `` Although we want harmonious relations with our host country, we are satisfied that the court spoke in the same sense as we did,'' <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> said. `` We are ready to go to arbitration. It is now basically for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government to decide what conclusions it draws from this ruling,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was granted permanent observer status by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, and its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission has been operating since then out of an office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s information office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was closed down prior to passage of the American legislation. Early this year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said that arbitration was premature, noting that the anti-terrorist law would go into effect on March 22. When the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> refused to comply with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s March 22 order to close down its <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government filed suit in federal court. The American judge on the world court, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON>, voted against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In a separate opinion, <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON> said that although he had reservations about the court's opinion `` a state can not avoid its international responsibility'' by referring issues such as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission dispute to a domestic court. Since only sovereign states and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> bodies are entitled to bring cases before the court, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to plead its case. But confidential briefs believed to support its position have been filed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In 1986, the court ordered a halt to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration support for the rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government, ruling that the support violated international law. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> boycotted most of those proceedings, claiming the court had no jurisdiction in the case.

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> said Tuesday its troops and those of neighboring <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> have begun withdrawing from their common border as part of a plan to end a century of hostilities between the East African neighbors. The government-owned newspaper The Ethiopian <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said a joint military committee monitored the initial withdrawals, which took place from April 15-23. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> agreed on April 4 to restore diplomatic relations broken 11 years ago when they went to war over a patch of land. They also agreed to move their forces six to nine miles from the border to ease tensions, with redeployment to be completed by May 15. Neither side has said how many troops were involved. The Somali military, however, had estimated that <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> had 150,000 troops stationed permanently on the Somali front. Marxist <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> has the largest military force in black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, more than 500,000 members, including local militia. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has a military force of 65,000. Border disputes have made <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> enemies for more than a century. In 1977-78, they fought a full-scale war after <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Ogaden </LOCATION>, a semiarid region of eastern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> populated by ethnic Somalis. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> drove back the invaders with the help of thousands of Cuban troops and arms from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s chief ally.

<HEAD>Paper Prints Details on Removal of Stalin's Body</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In another attack on the legacy of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, a newspaper gave details Tuesday about the removal of his body from the Red Square mausoleum where the body of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> is entombed. The labor newspaper Trud published an article in response to a question from an 18-year-old soldier, <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzmin </PERSON>, who said many young Soviets knew nothing about the removal of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s body from the mausoleum in 1961. Under the more open atmosphere fostered by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Soviet scholars and journalists have begun re-evaluating <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s record. He ruled the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from 1927 until his death in 1953. Under his dictatorship, millions of people perished in purges, forced collectivization of agriculture and rapid industrialization. <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> died, `` many people did not know of the circumstances connected with the gross political mistakes, massive repression and lawlessness'' during his regime. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wall during the night of Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 1961, at the time of the 22nd Communist Party congress The party was led at that time by <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who had denounced <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s `` cult of personality'' during a secret speech to party officials five years earlier. Col. K.A. <PERSON> Moshkov </PERSON>, who was in charge of overseeing the mausoleum, told Trud he was called to the Kremlin for a meeting Oct. 31 at which officials decided where to place <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s body. He said the officials had considered placing it in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Novodevichy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> was buried after she committed suicide in 1932, but agreed to place it in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wall <PERSON> Moshkov </PERSON> told Trud that soldiers moved the body during the night, with only <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> present. In the morning the official news media carried a one-sentence statement that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s body had been moved. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s body has been enshrined in the mausoleum since his death in 1924. In a speech last November, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s guilt was `` enormous and unforgivable,'' but he defended the former leader's basic policies

<HEAD>Defense Lawyer Criticizes Prosecutor's Attempt to Limit Access to
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A defense lawyer for Iran-Contra defendant <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> accused prosecutors Tuesday of violating a court order by trying to limit his client's access to classified documents compiled in the case. The procedures proposed by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to limit <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s right to see certain highly sensitive government documents `` directly contravene'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s order, defense lawyer <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> charged in court papers. <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s proposal also would limit access of retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s former business partner who also is charged with participating in the illegal conspiracy to divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The two brokered the arms sales through a series of Swiss-based companies, which also funneled money to the Contras. Under the proposal by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office, all classified documents turned over to the defense would be made available to lawyers for <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> as well as counsel for the other two defendants: Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. North, a fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, also would be allowed to review all documents furnished to the lawyers, according to a proposal outlined in a letter sent by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office this week to defense counsel. Before they left the White House staff in November 1986, both <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> had security clearances and access to the nation's most well-kept secrets and presumably saw _ or generated _ much of the material collected by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigators. But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s proposal said <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> would not get automatic access to `` particularly sensitive information.'' This material includes documents whose disclosure would jeopardize the lives of hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or compromise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence methods, `` particularly sensitive military operations'' and `` extremely sensitive foreign policy initiatives,'' according to the letter. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> who has <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship, has never had access to government documents. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who once held sensitive positions in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, held a number of security clearances before his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> retirement. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> on April 15 to allow the defense to review some 300,000 pages of classified material to determine if it would help their case. An interagency task force is checking the material before it is turned over to the defendants to see what highly sensitive information is included. The sensitive documents covered by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s proposal comprise between 5 percent and 10 percent of the material reviewed so far, defense lawyers were told at a recent meeting with prosecutors. Under the proposal that <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> contends violates <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s April 15 order, defense lawyers could show <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> certain sensitive documents only after obtaining the judge's permission. `` It would be within the court's discretion to solicit the government for its views and to make special arrangements for access as the court deems appropriate,'' associate independent counsel <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> wrote in the letter outlining the proposal to defense counsel. During the hearing, <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> that <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> `` has no less a need than the other defendants'' to review the documents. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> that he would not bar defense lawyers from telling their clients anything about the case, including information in classified documents. In his protective order, the judge said the defendants and their lawyers could gain access to the documents if they signed agreements not to disclose the information. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s order warned that unauthorized disclosure could result in prosecution and he set stringent conditions for working with the documents in a special secure area being constructed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> said the proposed procedures `` directly contravene the court's protective order, which places only limited conditions on access to classified information, all of which were met by Mr. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and his counsel.'' `` Both judicial precedent and the pronouncements of this court make it clear that the government must now give Mr. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> access to the information in its possession or face dismissal of the indictment against Mr. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> said. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, classified documents deemed relevant to the case could only be introduce as evidence by either side if they are declassified by the government. At the April 12 hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> warned that he would be forced to dismiss the case if <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> were unable to get relevant documents declassified. `` The classification system must be adjusted to the needs of the case or the case will collapse,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with more detail, quotes.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of `` terrorism and subversion'' and broke relations Tuesday, ordering all Iranian diplomats to leave the kingdom within a week. A statement broadcast by state-run television and distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> cited a riot by Iranians during a pilgrimage to Mecca last year in which hundreds of people died, a subsequent attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and attacks on commercial shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. On Sunday, Iranian speedboats attacked a Saudi-owned tanker in the Strait of Hormuz hours after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to stay clear of neutral ships. An informed source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said privately that the Saudi council of ministers decided Monday night to end diplomatic relations with <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s revolutionary regime. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and most other Arab countries support <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which began in September 1980. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is a Moslem nation but its people are Persian, not Arab. The Saudi statement said that King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON>'s government exercised self-restraint and prudence for a long time, despite Iranian practices that `` run counter to norms and diplomatic traditions,'' before deciding on the break. A memorandum about the decision was handed to the Iranian charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, the news agency reported. According to the published statement, `` The government of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has decided to sever its ties with the government of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and asked all personnel of the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> and the consulate general in <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> to leave the kingdom within a week.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Saturday, five days after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or disabled six Iranian naval vessels, against continuing attacks on neutral shipping. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> have made virulent statements about each other since riots in Mecca on July 31, 1987, that killed 275 Iranian pilgrims and the subsequent sacking of the Saudi Embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. A Saudi diplomat died of injuries suffered in the attack. Saudi security officials said 402 people were killed in a stampede after an Iranian political demonstration in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> turned violent. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> police caused most of the casualties by shooting into the crowd. Mecca, birthplace of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, site of his tomb, are the holiest places for the world's 850 million Moslems. They are in a region of western Saudi Arabian called Hijaz. Iranian leaders, who often threaten to export their fundamentalist revolution to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other gulf nations, exhorted the world's Moslems after the Mecca riots to overthrow the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> royal family, seize its vast wealth and take away custodianship of the Islamic shrines. Officials of the pro-Western kingdom accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of terrorism. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said 150,000 Iranian pilgrims would travel to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> this year and demonstrate against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Government officials had said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> would reduce the number of pilgrims traveling to the holy city this year but have not given figures. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reacted by threatening to boycott the annual pilgrimage. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is the leading member of the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an economic and defense alliance that also includes <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. Arab diplomatic sources said it was unlikely other council members would follow the Saudi lead and break with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, despite Iranian missile attacks on Kuwaiti territory and raids on the Emirates' offshore oil facilities. Earlier Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fahd </ORGANIZATION> decided to sign an international treaty limiting the spread of nuclear arms. The move apparently came in response to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fears that the kingdom might arm its missiles with nuclear warheads.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> captured 71 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s caucuses in his strongest showing yet in the West. With just over 90 percent of the vote counted Tuesday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s unofficial tally showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 7,550 votes to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1,682, or 16 percent. Some 1,231, or 12 percent, were uncommitted. Based on those tallies, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would pick up 21 of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s 23 Democratic delegates, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would gain two. Party officials said vote counting from Monday's caucuses was progressing slowly Tuesday because of debate over a rule governing uncommitted delegates and difficulties in contacting some county leaders to get their returns. Official results were not likely to change the outcome for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, who already has won commitments from three of the state's five `` super delegates,'' bringing his <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> delegate total to 24. `` We're really happy. It's his biggest victory in the West,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Knoblock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state campaign coordinator. `` It's a long way from home to be winning by this kind of margin. We've been slowly climbing in the West, but this took a quantum leap.'' Still, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters showed respect for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s showing in a state with a white population of 93 percent and where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received only 4 percent of the vote in 1984. `` He has moved the population that has not been involved in politics,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state co-chairman. `` The votes that came in for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were certainly not all-inclusive minority votes. I feel very good about what we've done,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> state chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> Republicans faced fewer choices at Monday's caucuses, which included mainly advisory votes on their preferences for vice president and whether they favor holding a Western regional primary in 1992 similar to the South's Super Tuesday. Results of the Republican balloting will not be available for several days, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> said. `` But I know that <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> all were named.''

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A restructuring of federal airline and interstate highway programs would eliminate bureaucratic practices that interfere with aviation safety and road improvements, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said Tuesday. When the interstate highway system is completed in the next few years, the states should assume responsibility for their roads because that way, the projects with the most merit would get top priority, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Costly and extraneous federal requirements now imposed on the use of funds could be virtually eliminated, ensuring a greater transportation return on every dollar spent,'' he told a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are looking at ways to encourage and promote innovative financing mechanisms'' such as permitting the use of tolls on highways built with federal funds, he said. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>, who has proposed a reshaping of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has never done an adequate job of safety regulation and enforcement of the airline industry because it is subjected to the federal budgetary process and is operated through a maze of federal laws and rules. There is a `` morass of inhibitions on its growth and proper management,'' said <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>, who took over as transportation secretary from <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in December. He has described the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> as a `` hybrid'' agency that combines safety regulation and enforcement duties with the nuts-and-bolts operation of running the air-traffic control system. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> would like to separate the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s safety role from its operational functions, and there is a move afoot in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to separate the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> indicated he agreed with efforts to do so. He did n't say how this should be done, but he said he would oppose turning air traffic functions over to a privately run company. On airline safety, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We've tried to toughen up inspections across the board,'' pointing to the current investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The 30-day, plane-by-plane inspection of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet, which began April 13, is evaluating <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to comply with <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> safety standards and has resulted in a proposed $ 823,000 in fines against the airline. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>, who flew to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said the airline is `` one of the safest, if not the safest, airlines in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of the attention it has received. ... I flew it with extreme confidence today.'' A similar inspection is also going on at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. The transportation secretary said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigation was under way before <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots began a postcard campaign detailing alleged maintenance and safety violations. `` I really resent the leadership of the union and the company ... using safety issues as a weapon against each other,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> told a press conference. He said the two sides `` could duke it out'' without resorting to safety allegations. In his luncheon speech to the AAA convention, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the 1987 traffic fatality rate was the lowest in history, with 2.4 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. `` There were just over 46,000 Americans killed on our highways last year, which is tragic by any standard,'' he said. `` But if fatalities were still occurring at the 1980 rate, the death toll would have been 17,000 higher. Both numbers are mind-boggling.'' He credited the reduction in highway accidents to the crackdown on drunken - and drugged-drivers, the greater use of seat belts and new safety rules affecting trucks <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said it was too early to say what effect the new 65 mph speed limit on rural interstate highways was having on safety.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and law enforcement groups agreed Tuesday on compromise legislation to ban undetectable plastic handguns, using an approach that has been staunchly opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and its legislative supporters. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of liaison, said the proposed legislation would be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week. The compromise represents a change in position for Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who earlier endorsed the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> approach. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> now believes that the compromise language is more enforceable, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. The approach to dealing with plastic guns _ which are not yet being manufactured _ has generated the latest raging debate between the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> and handgun control groups. Gun control groups _ joined by police organizations _ have been lobbying for a bill that would require a minimum standard of metal in any gun, so that the weapon would trigger an alarm in today's metal detectors The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has supported a bill by Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, which would ban undetectable plastic weapons but would set no minimum standard of metal. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>'s approach, however, says that weapons must be detectable by existing magnetometers. After several rounds of high-powered lobbying, full-page advertisements, fund-raising appeals and doomsday rhetoric by all sides, the administration has adopted the minimum metallic standard as the best approach. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> officials were not immediately available for comment on whether they would accept the new approach. But last year, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> said a bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> _ which included a minimum metallic standard _ would make a number of small, existing handguns unlawful and amount to `` the first federal gun ban bill in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said no currently made guns would be barred under the compromise standard, and said he hoped `` everyone can claim victory.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said neither the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> nor the gun control groups were part of the negotiations. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, commenting on the compromise, said he believes the proposal brings all sides closer together, although he stopped short of an endorsement. But he added that if the new language would not ban any existing guns, there would be little substantive difference between the two measures. `` What we were trying to make certain of is that this is a detection bill and not a confiscation bill,'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. The senator said the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> was aware of the new language, and `` reacted cautiously. They want to make certain we do n't get into the realm of confiscation of weapons owned by law-abiding citizens,'' he said. The compromise was hammered out quietly by the Justice, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> departments and the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, representing 11 of the nation's major law enforcement groups. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said earlier this year that he backed the <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> bill. But <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> declined to say that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had backtracked, commenting instead that the attorney general `` will say, ` Here's another route that we think is optimal. We're not turning back on the <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> bill. We think this is a better bill. It's more enforceable.''' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` ordered a large in-house study on how detection works,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said, and administration experts accepted a metallic standard of 3.7 ounces of stainless steel. That figure means any gun passing through a magnetometer must be as detectable as one with 3.7 ounces of stainless steel. Such a standard allows a weapon to have less metal or a different type of metal, as long as the standard is met. The legislation does not specifically mention plastic guns, but would ban any weapon that does not meet the standard. So far, Red Eye Arms of Winter Park, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, says it has a patent for plastic weapons but wo n't start making such handguns for at least two years, and then will only make them for military and police use. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, the chairperson of the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the compromise was not aimed at opposing the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, but at writing legislation that is `` workable and would protect the public.'' She said the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> should be `` given an opportunity to look at this without it being put to them as something they're not going to like.'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, whose current bill has a slightly higher metallic standard than the compromise, said he was `` pleased to hear the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has listened to the very legitimate concerns of the law enforcement community concerning undetectable weapons. `` From what we understand of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> proposal, it is fully compatible with our legislation and I expect we will be able to incorporate it,'' he said. His bill is co-sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, who was influential in bringing the law enforcement groups and the administration together. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the Judiciary subcommittee on crime has unanimously approved a plastic gun bill sponsored by its chairman, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, D-N.J. That measure, which went to the full <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would require that plastic guns have at least 3.7 ounces of metal _ but has no provision that would allow lesser amounts of metal that would also trigger the alarm. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, asked about the compromise, said he prefers to use his own bill as the vehicle for plastic gun legislation because it has already begun moving through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with bipartisan support. He added, however, `` I do n't think there's any significant difference,'' between the two proposals.

<HEAD>Brazil Hires U.S. Firm to Fight Oil Well Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday it has hired the firm of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil-well firefighter <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> `` Red'' <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> to put out a blaze at the country's largest offshore oil field. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>, spokesman for the government oil firm <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION>, said two employees of the Adair company, based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> early Tuesday. He said they went directly to the Enchova oil field in the <LOCATION> Campos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, where a fire has been burning out of control at an offshore rig since Sunday. The Enchova field and four connected fields have been shut down, cutting <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s oil production by 71,000 barrels a day. The country's daily production is 615,000 barrels. <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON> said the fire started with a gas leak at an oil rig 50 miles off the coast and all 250 workers were evacuated unharmed. Four ships with water cannons sprayed the rig around the clock to minimize damage but could not put out the blaze, according to <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>. `` There are two possibilities for putting out the fire,'' he said. `` One is to dig a parallel well and draw off the oil and gas feeding the fire. The other is the Americans' way, with an explosion that uses up oxygen and kills the fire.'' <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> plans to import an additional 60,000 barrels of oil a day at a cost of about $ 1 million to cover most of the loss of production from <LOCATION> Enchova </LOCATION>. `` The platform itself cost $ 330 million and is covered by insurance. A few towers fell down, but apparently it will not be destroyed by the fire,'' <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON> said. The Campos basin is <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s richest oil region and has produced 370,000 barrels daily. But <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> still needs more oil, and imports in the first quarter averaged 718,000 barrels per day.

<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout to CORRECT that radio marriage proposal

 Nine Soviet and four Canadian skiers arrived Tuesday at the North Pole, their first major objective in an attempt to become the first expedition to cross the Arctic on foot. `` Everybody is in great spirits, all hale and hearty,'' said expedition radioman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` It's a personal victory. They're more than halfway.'' Organizers revealed that wedding bells rather than jingle bells were ringing for one jubilant skier as the group approached the pole earlier this month. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calabogie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, in a radio message relayed by a Soviet air base in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, asked his steady back home, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>: `` Will you marry me?'' `` It's so much like <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, he has to do everything different,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, a dental hygienist in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. Her answer, relayed to <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON>, was yes. The team set out from the northernmost tip of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> on March 3 and hopes to complete the 1,100-mile trek through some of the world's most hostile terrain by reaching <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ellesmere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, in early June They arrived at the geographic North Pole at 3:20 a.m. EDT Tuesday, the 55th day of their adventure. Soviet explorer and folk hero <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shparo </PERSON>, Anglican priest <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and the other skiers planned two days of rest before continuing the `` Polar Bridge'' expedition. From the pole, they sent a short radio message: `` The first span of the bridge is complete.'' The team seeks to become the first to make the transcontinental trip across the Arctic without using vehicles or sled dogs. Bad weather prevented a group of Canadian dignitaries from reaching the pole in time to welcome the skiers, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. Because of poor visibility at Alert, a refueling stop on the northern tip of <LOCATION> Ellesmere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the Canadians were stranded at <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, 300 miles south. Their final destination was a floating Soviet ice station within helicopter range of the North Pole, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. He said a group of Soviet dignitaries, including former hockey star <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Tretiak </PERSON>, made it to the pole, where the temperature was about 22 degrees below zero. Supplies were flown to the Soviet ice station Tuesday. Each member of the expedition carries a 100-pound backpack with such high-protein, high-fat food as bacon and dried fish to maintain energy and body heat. The Soviet team has government sponsorship and the Canadians found commercial backers. The Soviets proposed the expedition to demonstrate benefits of world cooperation and peace.

 Following is a translation by The Associated Press of the Saudi Arabian government's memorandum on the rupture of ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>: In view of the Iranian hostile attitude toward the kingdom of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the premeditated offenses to basic Saudi interests and as a result of the Iranian government attitude that runs counter to the principles of international law and diplomatic traditions; On account of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s violation of the principles of good neighborliness and mutual respect, as exemplified in the attempt to smuggle explosives into the Kingdom during the pilgrimage season of the year 1406 -LRB- 1986 -RRB- to imperil the safety of pilgrims and the sacred places; Because of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s manipulation of religious rituals and its instigation of dissent and unrest among the sons of the Islamic nation; Due to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s repeated attempts to harm the basic interests of the kingdom, and its obstruction of free navigation by raiding ships sailing to and from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, in addition to other forms of terrorism and subversion; The kingdom has resorted to the attitude of self-restraint and prudence required between two neighboring Islamic countries. It tried through various channels to explain to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that the kingdom was eager to normalize relations on the basis of mutual respect: But the kingdom's positive stance gained no response whatever from the Iranian side, which persisted in perpetrating hostile practices; Foremost among these practices was the ransacking of the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> embassy of -LRB- King Fahd -RRB- the custodian of the two holy shrines. One Saudi diplomat was killed, embassy documents were looted and its property destroyed in that attack. In addition, the Iranian authorities had failed to provide adequate security for the embassy personnel, who were perpetually harassed, forcing them all to leave <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>: Therefore, the government of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> decided to break its ties with the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and asked all personnel of the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> and consulate general in <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> to leave the kingdom within a week.

<HEAD>Tough Principal Says Reagan Neglect Has Spurred Blacks To Better

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has denied opportunity to blacks during his administration, but by doing so has spurred them to improve their lives, a high school principal known for unorthodox disciplinary tactics said Tuesday. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has played a key role in the evolution of black folks,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told about 1,500 people gathered here for the 102nd Annual Convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` What <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did was take the handout away from black people and make us work for ourselves,'' he said, adding that the result was massive voter registration by blacks. Tuesday was the second day of the three-day meeting. Later Monday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> was scheduled to address the convention, which has attracted newspaper executives representing 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who is black, rose to prominence last year because of his unorthodox methods of discipline at the primarily black, 3,000-student <ORGANIZATION> Eastside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. He told the mostly white audience that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> welfare economy had made blacks unproductive and decadent. `` We've lost a generation of black folks to drugs, we've lost a generation to illegitimacy,'' he said. The way to reverse the decline is to provide role models, to bring successful blacks back into the ghettos to provide inspiration, he said. `` Where are the <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodens </PERSON> of science? Where are the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordans </PERSON> of mathematics?'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> asked. `` They're out there,'' he said, but must return regularly to the inner city to encourage those left behind. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> had a more physical solution for fighting crime. `` I think a few lynchings are in order,'' he said, adding that the drug problem in the <LOCATION> Unites </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was so severe that sometimes violence was the only answer. Such tough attitudes and his habit of carrying a baseball bat through the halls of Eastside High have angered civil libertarians and others who say <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> is all talk and little action. He counters that he has the support of his students and their best interests in mind. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s emotional and wildly applauded speech contrasted sharply with a panel discussion on the status of minority workers that preceded it. But the message was often the same: along with encouragement, minorities need educational opportunities to help them compete in the work world. Panelist <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON>, a principal with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> management consulting firm <PERSON> Booz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said minorities and women should be judged on their individual merits, not considered universal representatives of their race, sex or culture. `` Judge people on their own merits and give them a chance to succeed as individuals,'' he said. <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON>, who is black, advised minority applicants not to try to fit into a white mold, but to `` emphasize our diversity. Try to find companies that value our diversity.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the publisher and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, moderated the discussion, which also included <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vice president for personnel administration and development; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, executive director for human resources at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin-Lor </PERSON>, an area director of human resources for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said newspapers staffed predominantly by white males risked ignoring the needs of many readers and becoming irrelevant to them `` It's hard for a newsroom full of white, male editors to fake the insight you need to relate to a diverse community of readers ...,'' he said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the economic survival of businesses, including newspapers, depended on staff diversity. Companies `` that fail to consider minorities in their marketing strategies ... will be the companies that lose the competitive race,'' he said. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolchin </PERSON>, authors of `` Buying into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: How Foreign Money is Changing the Face of Our Nation,'' said foreigners were buying property and businesses all over the country, without the federal government investigating the long-term effects. `` Foreign investment is happening to us quicker than we can absorb it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tolchin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The attorney for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman who claims the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> libeled him Tuesday criticized the filing of a brief by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in defense of the Soviets' position. Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> said he believes the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has `` made a deal _ a backroom political deal'' with the Soviets to avoid further conflict in the 3 -LCB- - year-old case involving <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> `` They've swapped an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen's rights for what the Soviets want,'' said <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>, who seeks payment of both a libel judgment and the cost of medical supplies which Gregorian sold to Soviet hospitals before he was expelled from that country. `` Gregorian's life-saving medical equipment is being used in hospitals in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the American government is trying to help the Soviets weasel out of paying,'' said <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>. `` This case has gone beyond being a simple trade case.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s legal brief, filed last week in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, seeks to reopen a case which led to an award to Gregorian for the loss of more than $ 200,000 worth of medical supplies. <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>, meanwhile, is seeking to reopen the libel portion of the case, which was thrown out by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, did business in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for 14 years. He was operating a $ 10 million a year medical supply company in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> when he was abruptly expelled in November 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> printed an article alleging he was a spy and <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> decided to sue. In the opening rounds of his litigation, <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> won by default when the Soviets failed to come to court. But when <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> began seizing Soviet assets to satisfy the damage judgment, the Soviets began to fight back, seeking a hearing in federal court. After long months of litigation, <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> reversed himself and threw out the libel award, but the judge ruled that <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> must be compensated for the medical supplies he left behind. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s 49-page brief backs <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>'s conclusion that the Soviets should be immune from libel suits, and also argues that they should be allowed to mount a full defense on the issue of paying for medical supplies. In its brief and accompanying documents, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contended that the <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> case `` has become a significant issue in bilateral <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> relations.'' <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> labeled that argument `` ridiculous.'' `` We fail to see how forcing the Soviets to pay for medical supplies will start World War III,'' the attorney said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Letter </PERSON>, an appellate staff attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said he would not comment further on the case or <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>'s criticism. `` Our reaction is that we are not litigating the case in the press,'' he said. `` Our position is stated in the brief.'' The Soviets submitted their own brief this week, stating points similar to those raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It was filed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Popper </PERSON>, who represents the Soviets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A key issue raised by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials from the beginning of the case was whether a successful libel suit against the Soviets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would leave <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens open to similar suits in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has offered this possibility as a reason for their support of the Soviet position in the Gregorian case.

 Soldiers and machines filled the central square Tuesday, saluting a decade of Communist rule. The parade also was a reminder of an equally long civil war the regime's Soviet sponsors are about to abandon. Thousands of the 40,000 soldiers conscripted to defend the government of Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> against Moslem guerrillas marched past the leadership in a parade modeled on Red Square observances of May Day and Revolution Day. Soldiers, workers and weapons coursed for more than two hours through Ideghi Square after a night of unusually heavy rifle fire and a guerrilla rocket strike in the hills east of the city. Joining the parade were 10 T-62 tanks not previously known to be in the Afghan arsenal. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> led dozens of Afghan officials and a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation to the parade. About 500 guests and visiting journalists were clustered under striped awnings on a reviewing stand. The senior Soviet official was <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s parliament. His minor rank appeared to reflect the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> desire for a low profile after agreeing this month to start pulling its estimated 115,000 soldiers out of the country on May 15. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapounov </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who accompanied journalists from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, denied suggestions that the Soviets were snubbing celebrations of the April 1978 coup that brought Communists to power. He acknowledged, however, that Soviet representation was a contrast with a Politburo-level group that went to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> in 1984 for the 10th anniversary of the Marxist government that overthrew Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>. `` What is there to celebrate here?'' <PERSON> Sapounov </PERSON> asked. `` There is a civil war going on.'' A Moslem insurgency began immediately after the coup that ousted President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> a decade ago. More than 5 million Afghans fled _ about one-third of the population _ most of them to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s neighbors on the east and west, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Towns and refugee camps that house more than 3 million Afghans just inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> serve as bases and supply points for the insurgents, and the major guerrilla groups have their headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Despite a lukewarm show of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> support for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> festivities, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government followed the Soviet style from the mass demonstration of worker support to taped chants and songs blared across the parade ground through a scratchy public address system. Platoons of soldiers with Soviet-supplied Kalashnikov assault rifles parade-stepped past the leaders, over whom half a dozen bodyguards with <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> machine guns kept watch. After sunset, Afghan soldiers fired shots into the air during private celebrations. Similar firing was heard Monday night but a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, Solidarity and Friendship confirmed that a loud explosion early Tuesday was a guerrilla rocket landing in the eastern hills. `` It was especially noisy last night, perhaps because they -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- wanted to say something about the holiday,'' said the official, who asked that his name not be used. On Monday, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> proposed a withdrawal of government soldiers from posts near the Pakistani border to create `` a non-military line'' between the two countries. He said Afghan troops would leave their positions if guerrillas and Pakistani soldiers did the same. The proposal seemed to be little more than a face-saving admission of the difficulties the Afghan army has in fending off guerrilla attacks. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, head of the seven-party guerrilla alliance, said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the insurgents reject the idea of such a zone. `` Afghan refugees will be reluctant to return even to those areas that have been abandoned by the Soviet and Afghan troops,'' he told a news conference, and `` they want to be convinced that peace has returned to afghanistan.'' Soviet military forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one Communist government with another and remained to help fight the insurgents. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> became leader in May 1986, succeeding <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>, who is believed to be in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On May 15, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is to begin leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under a U.N.-mediated accord signed April 15 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as guarantors. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and several other countries have aided Afghan guerrillas via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Each superpower has reserved the right to continue aid while the other does. Afghan insurgents were not direct parties to the <LOCATION> Geeneva </LOCATION> agreement and say they will continue fighting.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two senators Tuesday asked the head of the Office of Government Ethics to determine whether any laws were violated in the award of government research contracts to a company with employees who served on a federal advisory committee. Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said a recent hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> turned up possible conflicts of interest Those conflicts involved two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an eight-member panel that gives advice on computer and battle management issues to the federal agency managing the nation's `` Star Wars'' missile defense program Those two <ORGANIZATION> Eastport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> members, whose names were not immediately available, are employed by <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which has won two SDI contracts. In a letter to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>, director of the Office of Government Ethics, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said the two multimillion-dollar contracts at issue pay for research directly related to recommendations made by the <ORGANIZATION> Eastport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, the first contract was based on an unsolicited proposal by <ORGANIZATION> ISI </ORGANIZATION>, submitted within two weeks of the -LRB- committee -RRB- report recommending such research,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said in their letter. `` Both contracts were awarded under questionable circumstances.'' When questioned about the contracts, the senators said, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ended the first contract earlier than planned and announced it would reopen negotiations on the second. The senators said the Federal Advisory Committee Act requires agencies to impose management controls on advisory committees and that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> conflict-of-interest rules require committee members to follow certain ethical standards and file financial disclosure forms. They asked <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> whether the committee members were subject to federal standards of conduct at the time of the contract awards, whether any laws or regulations governing ethical conduct were violated and whether the matter should be referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for investigation. <ORGANIZATION> ISI </ORGANIZATION> is a research group affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ISI </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for external affairs, said the institute welcomes the review by the Office of Government Ethics. `` We do n't believe there is anything that represents an ethical concern ... or a legal problem,'' said <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>. `` We believe everyone has acted in good faith.''

<HEAD>Television Shows First Pictures of Ethnic Protests in Caucasus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet television broadcast film Tuesday of chanting crowds of thousands in two <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics, the first scenes it has shown of ethnic unrest two months ago that led to at least 32 deaths. A 90-minute special about the trouble in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> included criticism of the official press and appeared to be an acknowledgment that reporting on the unrest was slow and incomplete. The host was <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Borovik </PERSON>, a journalist and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The show laid much of the blame for rioting on rumors, but also indicated silence by the media did nothing to squelch the rumors. Such a program could not have been appeared before Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness. It was called `` <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> _ Reflection on Rumors'' and began with a woman from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, criticizing lack of information from the media. `` I myself am not satisfied with the mass media, which incorrectly reflected the events that took place in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>,'' said the woman, who was not identified. `` Central television also was silent about what happened there.'' <PERSON> Borovik </PERSON>'s broadcast, which preceded the main news program Vremya, showed black-and-white film of thousands of chanting people jamming open areas in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Signs visible in the crowd demanded that the region, three-fourths of whose people are ethnic Armenians, be annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. Protesters also demanded improved cultural and economic conditions in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borovik </PERSON> did not reveal the origin of the film. He said protests began in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> in mid-February, leading to demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> by hundreds of thousands of people who heard rumors that protesting Armenians had been killed. More demonstrations followed in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, he said. Soviet officials have rejected the demand that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> be annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but offered a long-term program to improve the area's economic and cultural life. About 15 minutes of film showed demonstrations in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. It also showed broken windows and damaged buildings in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, the city in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> where the deaths occurred. The number of injured at <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> was given as 200, much higher than the 81 reported April 13 by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Officials told the program more than 80 people were under arrest on charges of murder or participating in the `` massive disorder in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Borovik </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> officials for negligence and said some lived in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> rather than the city they governed. He did not identify them, but the city <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, mayor and police chief were fired after the rioting. According to the program, 50 people were hurt in <LOCATION> Agdan </LOCATION>, a town in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borovik </PERSON> said a criminal spread a rumor in <LOCATION> Agdam </LOCATION> that a 12-year-old boy had been killed by Armenians in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. A young man interviewed by <PERSON> Borovik </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> criticized <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media for not providing information sooner on those killed in the ethnic rioting. Reports several weeks afterward said the dead were 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis.

 The drug Ritalin turned a difficult, hyperactive 9-year-old boy into `` a zombie,'' the boy's parents charged as they appealed to state school officials Tuesday not to force him to take the medicine. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesson </PERSON>'s parents appealed to a state education department hearing officer, and said they will go to court if necessary to override the <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION> school district's order that he go back on drug Ritalin, or another medication, before he is allowed back in his third-grade class. `` We stopped the pills after my husband suggested that he should get in the car with <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and drive until they hit a wall,'' said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON>. `` Life had become that much hell. Everything was coming apart.'' State school hearing officer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Falkenham </PERSON> did not indicate when he would rule on the <PERSON> Jessons </PERSON>' appeal of the school district requirement that he take the medication. The child is currently being taught by a tutor provided by the school system, pending the outcome of the hearing. Both sides agree <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> has serious behavior problems, but no one has pinpointed the cause. With medication, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> is manageable, school officials said in testimony submitted earlier. Without it, they said, he is disruptive and insults school officials, and refuses to follow the simplest of classroom instructions. Outside the hearing, <ORGANIZATION> Derry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s teacher sometimes had to call the principal to the class to physically remove <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> from the room when he refused to go out for lunch. <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobban </PERSON>, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s second-grade teacher, testified Tuesday that when the boy quit taking <PERSON> Ritalin </PERSON>, he `` did n't stay in his seat and pestered other children. I got no work from him.'' `` He could n't sit still even to do a five-minute reading task,'' she said, adding that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> began having temper tantrums, tipped over his desk and ate pencils and erasers. Ritalin is a stimulant, but paradoxically it can calm hyperactive children, many experts say. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> began taking Ritalin in the first grade when behavior problems surfaced and continued taking it before school and during the day for 18 months until the spring of last year. Off Ritalin, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> has gained weight, sleeps better and looks healthier, said his father, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. But he still does not know right from wrong, has a very short attention span and, in general is a `` bright but very trying child,'' <PERSON> Jesson </PERSON> said. On Ritalin, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> looked and acted like a drug addict with facial twitches, pale skin, little appetite and insomnia, his parents said. He would sit for hours in front of the television and rock back and forth, his mother said. Late in the afternoon, when the drug began to wear off, he would begin to kick, scream, cry for hours, remain awake until after midnight, refuse to eat, make repetitive animal noises and stare transfixed at the faces he would make in a mirror, his parents said. `` He was a child in the driver's seat,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jesson </PERSON>. `` If we had a good day, it was because <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> let us have a good day. He was full of rage and it demanded our constant attention.'' The <PERSON> Jessons </PERSON> rejected suggestions that they increase the amount of Ritalin to keep <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> medicated at night. `` The stuff made him a zombie. I could n't do that to him,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jesson </PERSON>. The alternative to Ritalin is <LOCATION> Cylert </LOCATION>, which can cause an enzyme buildup in the liver and would require <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s blood to be checked periodically, according to testimony from doctors who evaluated <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Since taking <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> off </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritalin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Jessons </PERSON> have experimented with their son's diet, trying to see what food substances or additives affect his behavior. Some experts have linked hyperactivity to a child's diet. `` We know he craves sugar and feels better when amounts of it are kept to the absolute minimum,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jesson </PERSON>. The Jessons have rejected the school district's proposal to put <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, provided he goes back on medication, in a program of counseling and behavior therapy. His parents want the school district to offer <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> a educational curriculum that includes counseling, behavior modification, and more focus on the needs of hyperactive children, such as special dietary needs _ but no medication. `` This kid had problems to begin with and then was blown apart by Ritalin,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jesson </PERSON>. `` This family is through with drugs. We need answers without drugs.''

 Israeli troops tracked down Arab guerrillas from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and fought them in rocky terrain and scrub brush just inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border Tuesday. Two soldiers and all three guerrillas were killed, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said. Two soldiers were wounded, one seriously with a bullet wound in his chest, in the bloodiest border clash since Palestinian riots broke out in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> - occupied territories to the south on Dec. 8 The military command said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also deported six <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas on Tuesday. The army would not specify where the six were taken, but neighboring <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was the most likely destination. The army said the six were among 50 guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> branch captured on Feb. 7, 1987. The 50 were aboard the small cargo ship <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> R </PERSON>, which flew a Honduran flag and was seized midway in its journey from <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Arab guerrillas captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are usually sentenced to prison terms in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Jewish state has expelled 20 Palestinians from the occupied territories since the unrest started nearly five months ago. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army blocked hundreds of Palestinians from reaching jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by confiscating their ID cards and requiring them to undergo checks at government offices. The government also temporarily revoked the press credentials of two foreign journalists, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, for failing to submit their dispatches to military censorship. The border attack began before dawn when an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> patrol discovered footprints northeast of the town of <PERSON> Kiriyat </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimona </PERSON>, an army spokesman said. For hours, troops lit the skies with flares and searched for the intruders, the spokesman said. The soldiers found the guerrillas about 200 yards inside the border and fired. The guerrillas responded by hurling hand grenades and firing a rocket, the spokesman said. Lebanese police said earlier that the attack occurred in <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> territory near <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shouba </LOCATION>. But a Syrian-backed group that participated in the firefight later said it occurred in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A soldier involved in the clash said troops and guerrillas were six feet away from each other when the fighting began. `` They were hiding on a deep slope inside a maze of trees,'' the soldier, who would not give his name, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was not possible to see them. From inside the maze the terrorists opened fire.'' The army identified the dead soldiers as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adiv </PERSON>, 29, a battalion commander of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Givati </ORGANIZATION> infantry unit, and Sgt. <PERSON> Ramzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahsh </PERSON>, 27, a Bedouin scout. Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, head of northern command, identified the guerrillas as Palestinians and said their target was civilian settlements. Police spokesmen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said it was a seven-man guerrilla ring belonging to two pro-Soviet groups, the Lebanese Communist party and the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said there were only three infiltrators and an Israeli military official told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that documents found on them showed they belonged to the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Naif </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatme </PERSON>. Later Tuesday, Hawatme's group said the attack occurred in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that 12 Israeli soldiers were killed. Both the Israeli army and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> police said two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and three guerrillas were killed. In a communique, <PERSON> Hawatme </PERSON>'s group said the attack was staged by `` Martyr <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> squad,'' referring to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander assassinated in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> April 16, apparently by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos. The communique claimed the fighting lasted from daybreak to midafternoon and said heavy machine guns and grenades were used. Earlier, a police spokesman said fighting broke out at 3:30 a.m. and the `` fierce clash'' raged for about three hours. The incident marked the 11th infiltration or attempted infiltration since Nov. 25, when a lone guerrilla landed a hang glider in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and attacked a military base. He killed six soldiers in a hail of grenades before being shot to death. Israeli officials have linked the attempts to the uprising in the territories. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 173 Palestinians and two Israelis have died since Dec. 8. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabagh </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the army had taken the ID cards of hundreds of Gazans and had ordered them to report to three separate offices to check if they owed money for taxes. The measures appeared aimed at breaking a tax boycott that has been a tactic of the Palestinian uprising. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was quoted as telling parliament's Foreign Affairs and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that fighting the uprising cost the army $ 257.5 million to date.

 Supporters of two rival presidential candidates clashed in a provincial capital and police fired tear gas to disperse the mob, officials said Tuesday. At least six people were injured. Newspapers and radio stations reported one person was killed and at least 10 were wounded by gunfire after fighting broke out in <LOCATION> Cuenca </LOCATION>, 185 miles south of <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, during a campaign visit Monday by populist candidate <PERSON> Abdala </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>. Officials denied the reports of shooting, however.

 Democratic leaders put the brakes on a major trade bill Tuesday, postponing a vote on final passage while they scrambled for enough Republican support to override a threatened presidential veto. Provisions that would limit export of Alaskan oil became a critical stumbling block as leaders campaigned to line up enough votes to make President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> think twice before reaching for his veto pen. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, postponed until Wednesday or possibly even Thursday a vote on the 1,000-page bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opposes because it would require all but the smallest employers to give notice of plant-closings and major The delay gave <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders more time to beat the bushes for Republican support. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> again signaled that he would veto the measure as it stands, saying in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., that lawmakers should `` finish the trade bill process in a way that serves <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interests _ not special interests. The centerpiece of the bill would streamline the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import restrictions to retaliate against international trade violations and aid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries threatened by stepped up foreign competition. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he was searching for ways to take care of complaints from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s senators that the bill was too restrictive of their state's oil exports Party leaders figured that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> need 14 Republican votes to demonstrate the two-thirds support needed to override a veto. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did not tip his hand by offering a specific count. He again said it was close. Both parties were bidding for support from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, who reported themselves incensed over the oil exports provision. `` This legislation discriminates very violently against my state,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a concept that I am unable to accept.'' Currently it is illegal to export any oil from the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline, but the state does export about 4,000 barrels a day from <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>. The trade bill would limit export of refined oil from a new installation at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to 70,000 barrels a day and 50 percent of output. The limit would apply statewide and thus act as a cap on any additional refineries built. Another provision would require that crude oil exports to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> of 50,000 barrels a day envisioned under a pending trade pact would have to be transported first to some point in the lower 48 states, presumably <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, before being sent back north of the border. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> said it was unconstitutional to discriminate against one state in legislation applying to the entire country. The crude oil provision had been sought by the maritime industry, which currently transports the oil to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> ports and would lose jobs if it were merely piped over the border to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, press secretary to Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, D-Wash., said <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> and other lawmakers had drawn the provision requiring shipment of crude to the lower 48 states before export to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> He said it merely echoed provisions already in the pending U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. He said <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> supported the provision because he feared maritime unions would scuttle the free trade agreement without it and because he was concerned about dwindling employment in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> maritime industry. `` It's a tempest in a teapot,'' he said. He said criticism of the provision contained political overtones for <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, who is currently running for a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat against former GOP Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>. `` This has a lot to do with <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> later met with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> and issued a statement afterward saying he believed it would be possible to reach a compromise. He added: `` I do n't think anybody in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wants to scuttle the entire bill on a single issue like <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil.'' The provision requiring a stopoff in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> port for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> crude exports does appear in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> free trade agreement, confirmed <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a press aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. He said it was placed in the pact at the urging of maritime interests. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said he would vote against the bill. He said the savings and loan industry in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and numerous other industries would be crippled by the plant-closings provision. He acknowledged a political risk in opposing the bill because it also calls for the repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies _ a move favored by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil industry.

<TEXT>
 Bands of young people set fire to street barricades Tuesday after police prevented them from holding anti-government rallies in mixed-race townships near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. A group of academic leaders held a news conference and issued a statement denouncing security force actions during more than a week of protests at township schools. `` Education can not happen at gunpoint,'' it said. Students in the townships are demanding the reinstatement of activist teachers dismissed by the government, the release of youths detained during protests and boycotts, and the lifting of restrictions on political meetings. In at least three townships _ <LOCATION> Athlone </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain and <LOCATION> Bonteheuwel </LOCATION> _ police blocked planned protest meetings Tuesday, local reporters said. Several journalists were questioned by officers and ordered out of the area under state-of-emergency regulations. There were unconfirmed reports that up to 20 youths were detained. Last week, police sent letters to school principals saying officers would be deployed on school grounds to enforce order if disruptions continued. Some principals said they would close the schools rather than allow security forces on the premises. At the news conference, student leaders, teachers and university administrators accused security forces of `` provocative actions.'' `` The security forces are effectively threatening to occupy schools in the name of law and order,'' their statement said. `` The response of the authorities is a recipe for chaos and confrontation.'' Among those signing the statement were <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, chief administrator of the predominantly white <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwel </PERSON>, administrator of the mainly mixed-race <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>. In other developments: _ The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid publication, received a warning from Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> that it could soon be closed for publishing material he considers subversive. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoim </PERSON>, the newspaper's co-publisher, said the warning meant <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> could act within three weeks to install an in-house censor or close the paper for three months. The New Nation, another anti-apartheid newspaper, has been closed for three months and several other publications have received warnings from <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. He has censorship authority under the state of emergency imposed by the white-controlled government. _ Civil rights workers said the government has declared the black township of <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> `` an emergency camp.'' The government is trying to relocate the township's residents and thousands are refusing to move. The civil rights workers of the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the emergency-camp designation meant that <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON>, near the northeastern city of Brits, was no longer governed by regular municipal laws and could be abolished. About 5,000 <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> residents have complied with government directions and moved to an area 15 miles away, but 8,000 have defied the government and refused to leave. Opponents of the relocation said the government wants to demolish <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> because of complaints from white residents in Brits who say the township is too close to their neighborhoods. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial classifications include whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed race.

 A pregnant woman who suspects that the father of her unborn child may have AIDS has been allowed to see the man's medical records under a court order. <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Tradup </PERSON>, 25, demanded the information in a suit she filed here so she could decide whether to abort the 9-week-old fetus. On April 22, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> ordered the records turned over to her. State Health and Rehabilitative Services officials complied Monday in a closed hearing. Under the judge's order, Ms. <PERSON> Tradup </PERSON> can not reveal the contents of the records. Her lawyer said Ms. <PERSON> Tradup </PERSON> had made her decision but would not reveal what it was. The suit names <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, co-owner of the Key West landmark Sloppy <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s Bar, as the defendant. <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> was hospitalized recently with an undisclosed illness, and his wife died earlier this month of causes that have been kept confidential by county officials. The suit said <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> `` is reputed in the community to have the AIDS virus, but has denied this to -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Tradup </PERSON> -RRB- and refuses to give -LRB- her -RRB- access to his medical records.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tradup </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Imogene </PERSON> <PERSON> Synon </PERSON>, said she was pleased with the result of the court action, but wished <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> had complied voluntarily. She said Ms. <PERSON> Tradup </PERSON>'s own AIDS test was negative and that an AIDS test conducted on <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> several weeks ago was negative. However, Ms. <PERSON> Synon </PERSON> said, Ms. <PERSON> Tradup </PERSON> wanted to examine further medical information. <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpern </PERSON>, said his client had no objection to Ms. <PERSON> Tradup </PERSON>'s access to the records, but he felt compelled to defend the confidentiality of AIDS data. `` My client recognized that anybody who was tested for AIDS would be faced with the same situation he was faced with,'' <PERSON> Halpern </PERSON> said. `` The potential abuse is horrifying that his records could turn up on the streets.'' But <PERSON> Halpern </PERSON> called <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>'s decision, `` a perfect balancing of the plaintiff's right to know while protecting the defendant's confidentiality.

 Israeli legislators criticized police Tuesday for failing to prevent a commuter bus hijacking in which three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> nuclear workers were killed by Palestinian guerrillas last month. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Virshubsky </PERSON>, a legislator from the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said the March 7 hijacking could have been prevented and charged police with trying to conceal mistakes Details of the police actions emerged after military censors lifted the lid off what news media here called a `` police failure in a security affair.'' A three-man guerrilla squad that infiltrated from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> killed three Israelis and wounded nine before being shot dead by a special anti-terrorist police unit that stormed the bus in the southern <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert. The guerrillas seized a military Renault-4 vehicle before hijacking the bus carrying workers from the Dimona nuclear plant. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said at the hub of `` the affair'' were three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policemen who were ordered to erect a roadblock on the highway linking Dimona with the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Beersheva </LOCATION> and stop the Renault-4. It said one policeman fired at the guerrillas' car but missed. A second policeman tried to fire but his Uzi submachine gun jammed. The third police officer did not fire at all because he was busy erecting the roadblock, the radio said, adding that the guerrillas passed through the barrier unharmed. `` At first they wanted to conceal all this from the public. They made every effort so that it does not reach public knowledge,'' <PERSON> Virshubsky </PERSON> told the radio. Ran <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a legislator of <PERSON> Virshubsky </PERSON>'s movement, told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the incident `` was not ... a catastrophe. But it was a serious failure.'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted police officials as saying `` the affair was blown up and a simple technical breakdown presented as failure.'' It added that after the incident, instructions were given to issue an M-14 rifle to every police patrol and check all weapons in the police arsenal.

 A civilian court ordered the provisional release Tuesday of a former armed forces commander charged with overseeing death squads, a judicial source said. Former Gen. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, about 50, was put under house arrest 10 days after he returned April 9 from four years of exile in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He led the armed forces and was considered the military strongman from 1982 until the military expelled him in March 1984. Dishonorably discharged and stripped of his rank, he was charged in 1984 in the disappearances of about 130 suspected leftists and the killings of about 30 others. When he returned to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, he said he was a born-again Christian. Judge <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> of the 1st Criminal Court released <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> without bail but ordered him not to leave the country, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. On his return home, the former general said: `` If anyone thinks they have evidence against me, let them take it to the courts. I have found tranquility and fear nothing and no one except God.'' Some subordinates may have kidnapped or killed suspected subversives, he said, `` and now it's being placed at my feet.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Tuesday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to extend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> reflected a criminal attitude. `` The embargo will not demoralize the Nicaraguan workers,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told a group of laborers who are working to develop 26 wells to improve the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> area's water supply. `` Our response to the embargo is this production of more water for the population of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` Here we have the results. The morality and conscience of the workers is stronger than the criminal attitude of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with all his embargos.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> represented a security threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` a ridiculous thing.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has done this to justify his terrorist and aggressive policy against the Nicaraguan people and workers,'' he added. In a statement sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` The actions and policies of the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continue to pose an unusual and extroardinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The embargo would have expired May 1. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first ordered the embargo in May 1985, cutting off all trade with the Central American country and denying Nicaraguan airliners and flag vessels access to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government but also has provided aid to rebels fighting to overthrow <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s Sandinista government.

 The Soviet government said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would face international moral condemnation if they violated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement on the civil war in <LOCATION> Aghanistan </LOCATION>. It also urged <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to shut down Afghan guerrilla bases inside that country. An official statement carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said politicians and officials, who it did not identify, began making `` statements contradicting the letter and the spirit of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords'' immediately after they were signed April 14. `` Any deviation from the recorded accords can harm the cause of the Afghan settlement and impair the moral prestige of a state that breaks the obligation assumed before the whole world,'' it said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signed the agreement, but Afghan rebel leaders did not. The statement carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will keep its part of the agreement and will withdraw its soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. About 115,000 Soviet military personnel are thought to be in the country. `` Their withdrawal will begin on May 15, 1988, and be completed not later than Feb. 15, 1989,'' it said. `` Our country is waiting for its sons who have helped a friendly neighboring nation that has found itself in trouble.'' `` The Soviet people will never forget their exploits and will hold sacred the memory of those who have laid down their lives on Afghan soil,'' it added. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the Marxist government fight the anti-communist guerrillas. The statement denounced the rebels, saying their rejection of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords `` only shows that the sense of responsibility for the destinies of their country and their people is lacking.''

 Officials have decided it is safe to cultivate about 74,000 acres of land near the Chernobyl plant back two years after the world's worst nuclear power accident, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The Soviet news agency said in a report from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> that radiation levels around the power plant in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> are well within internationally accepted norms. In a separate report, Soviet television showed film of a memorial gathering of relatives of those killed in the explosion and fire at the plant's No. 4 reactor on April 26, 1986. At least 31 people were killed by the blast and the release of radiation, and a cloud of radiactive material circled the Earth. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Denisenko </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ukraine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agro-Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> the land to be brought back into cultivation lies within the 18-mile zone around the plant that was evacuated after the accident. It said scientists are working in <LOCATION> Pripyat </LOCATION>, the former home of 49,000 people located three miles from the plant, to see if any long-term damage was done to plant life. `` So far we have not detected any mutations or changes in the chromosome systems of plants,'' said laboratory director <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkhipov </PERSON>. `` The research shows that the level of its contamination with radionuclides does not exceed the international medical norm for foodstuffs.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the radiation level near the plant's first reactor is about 0.5 milliroentgen an hour, and about four milliroentgen near the second reactor. A milliroentgen is one-thousandth of a roentgen, the standard measure of ionizing radiation. Experts say exposure to 50 roentgens or more per year is dangerous and 400 roentgens per year can be fatal. The news agency said a power plant worker would have to stay on the site for 50 years to receive the dosage of radiation considered the maximum allowable by international standards. Soviet news media generally have given a positive picture of work at the Chernobyl plant in a series of reports dedicated to the anniversary of the accident. But on Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda blasted sloppy repairs, drunkenness and nepotism at the plant. It said managers there act `` as though there has n't been an accident.''

 Sailors boarded the disabled submarine USS Bonefish drifting off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast Tuesday and began testing and pumping out what they said appeared to be toxic gases inside, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Earlier Tuesday, 19 of the 22 sailors injured in Sunday's explosions and fire were discharged from a hospital in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> The five-man boarding crew planned to continue its work throughout the night before any effort was made to enter the submarine, said Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Henney </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. `` Initial reports indicate the air contained high concentrations of toxic gases,'' <PERSON> Henney </PERSON> said. He said he could not identify the gas. `` They're pumping air through the ship to get the toxic gases to leave,'' he said. The boarding crew did not enter the sub and had no report of the condition inside the vessel and nothing further on the three missing sailors. The Bonefish was submerged when the explosions and fire began Sunday during a training exercise. The crew was able to get it to the surface and the skipper ordered it evacuated because of heavy smoke and toxic fumes. The frigate USS <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and the aircraft carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, both of which were on routine exercises with the Bonefish, evacuated 89 of the 92 crew members. `` It was a very harrowing experience we went through out there, Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, skipper of the Bonefish, said on arriving in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, by plane with other injured sailors from the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> hospital Tuesday. `` The acts of individual heroism by members of the crew of getting people off that ship are just too numerous to mention,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` The crew's behavior speaks highly of the training they went through and it was just phenomenal.'' Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tull </PERSON>, public affairs officer at the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, said Tuesday night that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> would have no further comment because of the pending investigation of the incident. Earlier Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> salvage crews briefly boarded the Bonefish to close an open hatch and prevent water from getting in the vessel, but high winds and rough seas prevented them from beginning testing. With winds of 21 knots, seas were running 6 to 8 feet and washing over the deck, <PERSON> Henney </PERSON> said. `` The decision was to close the hatch to eliminate the chance of water getting in,'' <PERSON> Henney </PERSON> said. A civilian submarine expert said the explosions and fire that disabled the diesel-electric submarine were typical of such pre-nuclear subs. `` It's the classic way the diesel-electric submarines go down the tubes in peacetime,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, author of `` Submarine Design and Development,'' said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, chief of naval operations and a former submariner, said the missing men may have died at their posts. `` All three of those individuals ... were on watch in the ship's control room and were last seen there,'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said `` So it may well be that they simply ensured that everyone got clear and they themselves did n't make it.'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said the 30-year-old Bonefish, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s last remaining diesel-electric subs, was probably filled with toxic chlorine gas released by fire in the forward battery compartment. Diesel-electric subs use diesel engines to turn the propeller while cruising on the surface and to charge the batteries needed to run electric motors that move the boat while submerged. `` The typical accident happens when hydrogen builds up in the battery compartments while the sub is charging the batteries,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. `` A spark ignites the hydrogen _ and remember the ship is full of electric motors _ and you have an explosion followed by a fire and that fire produces the chlorine gas.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosions and fire but confirmed a newspaper report that the first explosion occurred while the ship was cruising at periscope depth. The Virginian-Pilot in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> said the boat may have been charging its batteries by using its snorkel to pull in fresh air to run the diesels while running within 50 feet of the surface. According to <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, the last American diesel-electric sub lost because of battery explosion was the USS Cochino, which went down near <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> on Aug. 26, 1949. The crew was rescued. The frigate USS <PERSON> McCloy </PERSON> was on station with the abandoned Bonefish and the USS Petrel arrived Monday with salvage crews from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the submarine's home port. The salvage ship USS Hoist from the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amphibious </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> arrived on the scene Tuesday, <PERSON> Henney </PERSON> said. The Hoist is designed for towing disabled warships, he said. Of the 22 crew members injured, only two were expected to require extended further treatment for smoke inhalation at the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Antone </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, were in serious but stable condition and improving, <PERSON> Henney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials told him his son and <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> `` were the last ones down in the engine room trying to get everyone out.'' Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Charless </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, was listed in satisfactory condition and was being kept for another day, according to hospital spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. The other 19 were discharged Tuesday to return to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. The missing sailors were identified as Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, 21, of <ORGANIZATION> Pisgah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials are putting the finishing touches on a return program for more than 5 million Afghan refugees, potentially one of the biggest <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> operations ever. The prospect of continued civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> makes a swift refugee return seem unlikely, but the world body is preparing for several possibilities. Envoys of the Office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees have begun talks on repatriation with the governments of the three countries involved _ <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> <PERSON> Faubert </PERSON>, head of the Afghan repatriation unit at <ORGANIZATION> UNHCR </ORGANIZATION>, said plans for returning the refugees are `` almost final _ and provisional, of course, because we do n't know when, how many and in what time frame people will move.'' `` We're trying to be ready for quick action if there is more rapid movement than some expect,'' he added. Also, the refugee situation differs in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, two border nations harboring the displaced Afghans. Officials of various <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies will meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Thursday to distribute tasks in the repatriation, said <ORGANIZATION> UNHCR </ORGANIZATION> sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is expected to appoint a special program coordinator shortly, as was done during the African drought emergency. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers will soon be deployed to monitor withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a political settlement. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> authorized him to proceed with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission. `` Our operation will be very much on in the next few days,'' he said. <PERSON> Faubert </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> UNHCR </ORGANIZATION> intends to supervise protection for the returnees, organize transportation back to their place of origin, and oversee the initial distribution of food, seeds and agricultural tools after they return. A communications network to monitor the different parts of the program must also be built. The effort is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars if all Afghans return, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee commissioner <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Hocke </PERSON> has said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is expected to launch an appeal for money soon. `` Our people are drawing up a number of scenarios that go from a massive rush to people not moving very quickly. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, there are about 20 different scenarios,'' <PERSON> Faubert </PERSON> said. He said it is also difficult to predict whether the refugees will return to several areas simultaneously or move region by region. Apart from logistics, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials are evaluating what aid is needed to rebuild roads and dwellings and restore land in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. More than a third of the population fled during 10 years of civil war. Official figures list 3.1 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and 2.4 million in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement signed April 14, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pledged to withdraw its troops backing the Afghan government, starting May 15. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed to ensure the safe and voluntary return of refugees. Not signing were Moslem Afghan guerrillas, who say they will continue fighting to overthrow the communist <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <ORGANIZATION> UNHCR </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> met with the resistance shortly before the pact's conclusion, apparently aiming to draw them into the repatriation plans. <PERSON> Faubert </PERSON> refused to reveal the outcome of the talks but said they will continue. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plans must also take into account the differences between government policy and the composition of the refugee population in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Most Afghans in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are displaced farmers, housed in 320 refugee villages within about 60 miles of the border. They own about 4,000 private trucks, so there could be sizeable, unsupervised returns. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, about 60 percent of the Afghan refugees are in cities relatively far from the border. Many are said to have found menial jobs. They may wait for years to return, <PERSON> Faubert </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which did not take part in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiations, and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> both pledge not to expel refugees. But Pakistani officials make clear they would welcome a quick return home of the Afghans. Many Pakistanis blame the refugees for a wide range of the country's social and economic problems.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers will be deployed soon to monitor withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a political settlement. From 40 to 50 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers are required under the Afghan agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> April 14. The nine countaries named in the provisional list to provide observers are <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will begin withdrawing on May 15, according to the Kremlin. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told a news conference the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had authorized him to proceed with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission. `` Our operation will be very much on in the next few days,'' he said. He said Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> will be his special representative on the settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The secretary-general's envoy negotiated the agreement with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after acting as mediator for nearly seven years. Afghan guerrilla leaders were not involved directly in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations and rejected the pact, vowing continued warfare. The accords were signed by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Assisting <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> will be Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Rauli </PERSON> <PERSON> Helminen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> who now is in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with Swedish aides. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> also will be aided by <PERSON> Benon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vahe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> as director and senior political adviser. Besides military observers, the Afghan settlement calls for a small civilian staff. The members will be divided into two inspection teams in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital. They are to monitor the Soviet troop withdrawal, provisions for return of Afghan refugees and other aspects of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief told reporters the composition of the observer team was under discussion and would be announced after <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approval. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were debating the composition from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and the West. They said the Soviets questioned the participation of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and sought greater representation from communist countries. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was asked how a small observer team of 40 to 50 men in the two capitals could successfully monitor the mass movement of men and refugees without passports across a 1,400-mile border. `` They will do their best, but they can not go beyond their mandate,'' he said, referring to the agreement that specifies small units in the capitals of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. In 1960, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> sent 20,000 peacekeepers to the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> when Belgian troops withdrew and bloody conflicts ensued. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was asked if a small team could keep peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where many experts predict much bloodshed, factional fighting among Afghan guerrilla groups and attacks on the Afghan government. `` We will take decisions ... I can assure you that we will face it if we have the necessary support of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and member countries,'' he said. `` We have experience, but we do not want to cross that bridge until we get to it.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> and his team `` will see if something is going to happen ... but it -LRB- deployment of a larger <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force -RRB- would be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> because we can not send troops into such a situation'' without approval.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his triumph in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary was `` a very big boost' toward the Dmeocratic presidential nomination, but the <LOCATION> Massachusets </LOCATION> governor refused to say he has won the battle `` I'm going to campaign as hard as I can in the primaries between now and June 7,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters. `` I'm gong to campaign in every single primary.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was particularly pleased to win another big state _ his fourth in a row _ in such a convincing fashion, racking up a better than 2-1 margin over remaining rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's a very big boost ... particuarly in a state that has been a bellwether state in the general election,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added. `` It's going to be very helpful. Asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to claim the crown yet, refering to Democratic nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s probelms in 1984. `` I reminded you several time that <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and then lost a string of primaries,'' he said. He said he would not change his campaign themes or strategy. ` I'm going to keep it as strong and positive as I possibly can,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The next round of contests comes next Tuesday, in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Thursday. Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has flip-flopped on his pledge not to raise taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the Republican primary in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and the contest was expected to yield enough delegates to give him a mathematical lock on the nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, bringing up the politically risky tax issue, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledge was a shaky one, like the claim by a comic opera character that he never gets seasick _ `` What, Never? Hardly ever.'' In recent days, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his possible November opponent, in answer to questions. Asked whether he would raise taxes, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave his standard answer: `` We've got to find new revenue. I do n't think any responsible candidate for the presidency can rule out new taxes. I ca n't make that judgment at the present time.'' Then he added: `` Even the vice president found that out. He announced on Saturday -LRB- promising no new taxes -RRB- and then kind of like the captain of the <ORGANIZATION> Pinafore </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday he said ` Well, hardly ever,''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the luncheon crowd. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was referring a line from the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> musical, `` HMS Pinafore.'' In the musical, the ship captain takes part in this famous dialogue: `` And I'm never, never sick at sea.'' `` What, never?'' `` No, never!'' `` What, never?'' `` Hardly ever.'' When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his campaign for the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in October 1987, he said, `` I am not going to raise your taxes. Period.'' But two days later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview on the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> that he might. `` What I have said is if I were convinced that all the spending that could possibly be constrained or cut had taken place, then and only then would I consider a tax increase,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been talking on the campaign trail about the giant federal deficit and what he calls the `` fiscal mess'' the next president will inherit from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. And this mess exists even with recent tax increases, he said. `` The current administration has raised taxes three or four times in six years,'' he said.

 At one point in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Richest Man in the World: The Story of <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> asks <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> how he thinks history will remember him. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> demurs, but he could have predicted that he would be immortalized in lame, exploitative made-for-TV movies to run in sweeps months on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> networks. This latest airs Sunday and Monday. What starts as inconsequential pulp basically stays that way, although, when <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> takes over the title role late in the first half, it threatens to become an interesting character study of a powerful man who knew exactly what he wanted and just could n't quite get it This is a sympathetic portrait of <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, as well as <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Callas </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Francesca </PERSON> <PERSON> Annis </PERSON> -RRB- and the rest of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> clan come off as a bunch of money-grubbing ugly Americans. The movie, based on the best-selling biography `` <PERSON> Ari </PERSON>,'' by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, is n't the first TV treatment of the Greek shipping magnate's life <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> portrayed a character obviously based on Onassis in the TV movie `` The Greek Tycoon'' several years ago. This time, he plays <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' father, a thankless role that has him alternately fuming and spouting fortune-cookie proverbs. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, incidentally, plays <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Koteas </PERSON> is adequate as the young <PERSON> Ari </PERSON>, though his role lasts too long, and he does n't in the least resemble <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, whose droopy eyelids and languid sensuality are perfect for playing <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, who in real life was n't exactly a matinee idol. The movie begins with <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> as a youth in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> where his father was a tobacco dealer. When the Turks begin rounding up Greeks, attractive young <ORGANIZATION> Aristo </ORGANIZATION> avoids being sent to a labor camp by having an affair with a Turkish colonel, no doubt with the words of his father _ `` A wise man does what is necessary'' _ ringing in his ears. But his father does n't appreciate the way <ORGANIZATION> Aristo </ORGANIZATION> has won the family's freedom, so <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> moves to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> where he sells cigarettes and begins a habit of seducing opera stars. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> shows up as <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> at 46, when he marries <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Beatie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> -RRB-, the 17-year-old daughter of a shipping competitor -LRB- <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerbe </PERSON> -RRB-. Now the luscious trashiness begins in earnest. After having two children, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON>, who may be young but is not stupid, notices her husband's philandering and leaves. <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> continues his pursuit of the volatile <PERSON> Callas </PERSON> while wining and dining jet-setters like <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Radziwill </PERSON>, and the powerful of the world, including <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>. <PERSON> Through </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, he meets her sister, the delicate wife of an up-and-coming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. The short, stocky <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> probably would have been delighted at a yacht scene in which <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> towers over the actor playing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Annis </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> as a symbol of respect, devoid of personality. After <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is assassinated, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, desperate for protection, figures <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> and his millions can provide it. Instead of marrying the tried-and-true <PERSON> Callas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> opts for symbolic triumph by wedding the world's most revered woman. His children care for no one but their real mother and contemptuously refer to her as `` the widow.'' <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> begins a spending spree that could put even <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> in the poorhouse, and she becomes enraged when photographers with scuba equipment and long lenses are able to photograph her topless. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> goes back once again to <PERSON> Callas </PERSON>. He also repairs a strained relationship with his son. But <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> dies in a plane crash, devastating Onassis. Shortly before he falls into ill health, <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> bequeaths to his daughter, <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagnell </PERSON> -RRB-, his business secrets, such as `` Write down everything, especially about people. When you meet them again, you'll know how much time they're worth.'' Too late for viewers, who will have already wasted almost four hours on the miniseries.

<HEAD>Crises By Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Every day since the stock market crash a half-year ago, an economic crisis of one sort or another has been forecast _ in trade, credit, stocks, bonds, car sales and more. Oddly, and offering a flash of insight about our times, none of the `` crises'' has arrived. They fade quietly, no apologies from their creators, and are replaced by vitally fresh hair-raisers. Are mortgage rates headed higher? Will the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> clamp down on the money supply? Can the dollar be saved? Economically speaking, the six months since the great stock market crash have been unusually calm. The economy has neither boomed nor busted. The jobless rate has trended lower. Securites have been fairly stable. It has not been that way in the forecasts. Had they been right, securities would be deeply depressed, unemployment would have soared, home mortgages would have been unattainable, plants and factories would be shutting down. In short, the economy as forecast would be in ruins. While forecasters suggest it is a miracle their worst estimates have n't come true, it is equally amazing to others that some forecasters wo n't give up. In almost every economic forecast there remains a sense of punishment due. Good economic news is seldom accepted for what it is; instead, it provokes forecasts of worse to come. Poor economic news is almost welcomed. The contrast between forecast and performance is especially obvious in the stock market, where it has become axiomatic that a pervading bearishness in the forecasts indicates, of all things, a higher market to come. Whatever the reasons, the persistent sense of fear in the forecasts has created the impression that the past six months have been ones of turmoil, whereas they have been closer to tranquillity. Why then do the fears linger? A sense of guilt, perhaps. If the stock market crashed why should n't a recession follow?. Recessions almost always follow, so why not now? A recognition that deep, and largely unresolved problems remain. The trade and budget deficits, Third World loans, a high level of credit at every level of the economy, the threat of trade wars, the volatility of markets. But that does n't fully explain why the good news is discounted. The economy, for example, has been neither strong nor weak, and either one could cause trouble; inflation in one instance, recession in the other. Jobs are being created. Inflation remains in check. Interest rates, though edging higher, have n't been jumping around as they once did. Exports are improving. Eventually there will be a recession, because if there is one clearly demonstrable trait of economies is that they run in cycles. Sooner or later expansions get out of hand, inflation begins, recession ensues. While recession is viewed as an event to avoid, it can be argued that it is necessary for clearing the way for the next expansion. But to view it that way might be more than the human mind can accept. No less acceptable, however, than the reign of terror in the forecasts of things to come that destroy the calm of the present.

<HEAD>Doo-wop Lives in Philly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The sound can still be heard in the city: four or five voices working on a street corner, in a resonant subway tunnel, maybe up on the roof. Doo-wop crested 25 or 30 years ago, with hits such as `` Earth Angel,'' `` Under the Boardwalk'' and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s own Silhouettes singing `` Get a Job,'' but it's never gone away. `` In the early'60s, this music was disappearing as a trend. But for the past four or five years it's coming back as an underground situation,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, tenor with the Zip Codes. The hopping and bobbing doo-wop sound now turns up in commercials for <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s blue jeans. But <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s street corners can still attract some harmony on a warm evening with a group of guys with nothing but a pitch pipe to get started on the right key. Doo-wop was city music _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ and that's where it survives. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>'s `` Rhythm and Blues Show'' on WXPN-FM keeps the flame alive. About 30 singers, who could n't afford instruments as teen-agers and do n't want them now, were in the studio recently to help <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> celebrate his 13th year on the air <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> travels 75 miles from his album-packed home in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to `` spin the sides'' every Saturday afternoon. `` It's like having a a second job, but a good portion of my paycheck goes into records,'' said <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, a chemist. With tens of thousands of records stacked on the floor, couch and tables of his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> apartment, <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> has plenty of tunes from which to choose. And with a man who spends every spare moment and all his spare change on this music, do n't call them oldies or nostalgia; they're terms that make <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> wince To him, these songs are n't locked in the past, or symbols of a lost era. `` The type of music we play on the air is mostly from the'50s, but that's just an accident of time,'' he said. <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> started in college as a deejay on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s student-run radio station, then moved on to <ORGANIZATION> WXPN </ORGANIZATION> He has n't found any reason to leave a microphone that puts him at the center of doo-wop singers and fans in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. During his radio show, <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> fields telephone calls from singers who recorded the 30 - or 35-year-old records he plays Occassionaly, he finds himself as the middleman in a reunion. The Keystoners credit <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> with bringing the group back together after 25 years of estrangement. Five years ago they sang in public for the first time since 1958 and are back recording, hoping to relive the success of their regional hit, `` Magic Kiss.'' Most singers, though, realize doo-wop stands little chance of ever being more than a hobby for them. `` You have to love to sing, because you're not going to get rich off it,'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said. `` We're looking forward to something very serious,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipman </PERSON>, baritone with <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION>, a group that traveled from northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to sing live on <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>'s show during the anniversary special. While doo-wop bears the imprint of church choirs and of mellow quartets such as the <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> says the specific doo-wop sound can be traced to <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Til </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>, whose 1948 hit, `` It's Too Soon to Know,'' inspired black teen-agers to sing on the street corners, <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said. `` He was to blacks what <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> was to whites at the time,'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said. Til's group was among the first to use a wordless falsetto, with other parts singing nonsensical syllables to round out the chord. Doo-wop legend has it that The <ORGANIZATION> Ravens </ORGANIZATION>' bass singer, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>, mistakenly started singing his part a few notes early one night, drawing a gleeful and raucous response from the crowd at the Apollo Theater in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. The doo-wop bass lead was born. With <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> singing lead, the group scored a hit with `` Old Man River.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>' 1949 hit, `` Do n't Tell Me So,'' reached No. 1 on the rhythm and blues charts, while `` Crying in the Chapel'' hit No. 11 on the pop charts, making it one of the first R & amp; B songs to cross over into the white market. `` For black kids, it was something they heard all their lives. It was white <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that suddenly turned on to it in the mid -'50s,'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> is n't sure when it happened, but at some point he turned from a fan to a historian of vocal harmony. With <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, he is working on a book about the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhythm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, whose style was more an extension of jazz than rhythm and blues. The Delta Rhythm Boys went to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> in 1960 when their popularity in this country waned. `` The sad thing is, a lot of forms of American music, while they have die-hard fans, need mass appeal. It's unfortunate a lot of black musicians have to go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. Lee Gains of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhythm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, `` probably one of the best bass singers in the history of the planet'' in <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>'s estimation, died July 15, 1987. Seven days later, while singing a spiritual at the funeral, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> suffered a fatal heart attack. With two members of the group dead, <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> is more determined to chronicle the music and its influences. `` People may not appreciate it -LRB- the music -RRB- now, but might in 2050 and wo n't know anything about it. I'm trying to preserve the history of this music before its lost,'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said.

 Officials say the postponement in giving the 1988 Templeton Prize for progress in religion to Moslem leader <PERSON> Inamullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> was at his request after some Jewish leaders accused him of anti-Semitism. `` He himself asked for the delay so assurances could be given that the charges were not valid,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Forker </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Templeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Board members are now looking into it in this country and abroad.'' He said the postponment was ordered April 5 and the inquiry was not likely to be concluded until mid-summer. Charges that <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> was anti-Semitic came after he was named in March to receive the $ 390,000 prize for advancing cooperation among Moslems, Christians and Jews. It had been scheduled for presentation May 10 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 73, of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to the prize office: `` I request that the prize ceremony be delayed, if necessary for several months, to allow full assurances to be given to the <LOCATION> Templeton </LOCATION> judges and the public to clear away untruthful accusations and misunderstandings.'' The criticisms were raised by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which alleged past anti-Jewish comments by <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> officers and in its newsletter. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> says, `` The allegation that the World Moslem Congress ever issued or mailed from its office any anti-Semitic literature is a palpable falsehood.'' He also said in a lengthy memorandum, answering questions relayed to him by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: `` I can never support anti-Semitic feelings because I am myself a decendant of Semitic ancestors from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> ... I respect Jews as ` People of the Book'; I respect <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> as a prophet of God.'' However, mentioning a point that outrages Jews _ the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> classifying of Zionism -LRB- Jewish nationalism -RRB- as racism _ <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> added: `` My difference is with the Zionists because the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has declared Zionism a racist creed.'' He also said the common Arab description of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as the `` Zionist entity'' has no significance. Jews, however, overwhelmingly resent it. Noting that he is a president of the interfaith <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> and Peace, he said, `` I have consistently preached inter-religious concord and understanding and promoted interfaith meetings.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, associate general secretary of the interfaith conference, observed of the controversy: `` The prize is not because the winner is a saint but because he has made some religious progress. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> has made some remarkable strides toward greater openness to other religions and respect for them.'' <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> had been accused by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION>, of denying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. However, <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said he backs <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> resolution 242, which supports a secure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and also Palestinian statehood. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> newsletter in the 1970's advertised the `` Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' a anti-Jewish forgery, and carried other anti-Jewish tracts _ not mentioned in questions to <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> `` may have changed somewhat but not sufficiently to set him up as a model of interreligious understanding and reconciliation.'' Particularly criticizing <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>'s reference to Zionism as racism, <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> said, `` It reflects a mindset that has n't changed that much.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a Jewish leader acquainted with <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> through the interfaith conference, said he `` has kept open paths of communication with other religions.'' But she said he also has shown what Jews see as `` strongly anti-Semitic views,'' by disparaging Zionism as distinct from Judaism. He reflects a `` very difficult mixture of right and wrong,'' added Ms. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, executive director emeritus of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> Sisterhoods. Much of the criticism of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> involved alleged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> newsletter items a decade or more ago. But <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> also cited a June, l986, item about a dinner <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> hosted for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> black Moslem leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> has called <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> a `` dirty religion.'' <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> for a 1985 letter of appreciation to The Spotlight, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, newsletter of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lobby </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> describes as virulently anti-Jewish. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said his `` innocuous'' letter mentioned no religion. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Religion and Peace, said the letter was merely a courteous response to solicited comment. `` Almost identical letters were written by Jewish personalities before knowing the anti-Semitic qualities of the publication,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Most of the accusations against <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> do not reflect personally on him, but on the distant history of organizations and others ... He distances himself from these institutional aberrations. `` <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> has stuck his neck out in some very unfriendly climate to build bridges of dialogue with Jews, Christians, Hindus and others. He has risked unpopularity in his own circles to do it.''

 Lurking among the canvases of langorous Polynesian nudes in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>'s new exhibition of the works of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> is a curious surprise, a wood carving that tells much about the enigmatic French artist. It is an elaborate door frame that <PERSON> Gaugin </PERSON> sculpted from redwood to decorate the entrance to the `` House of Pleasure,'' his primitive hut on the remote Marquesan island of <LOCATION> Hivaoa </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seas </LOCATION> where he spent the last three years of his life. Carved on both sides of the base, amid a tangle of nude figures, tropical fruits, animals and leafy garlands, are the two simple commandments that seemed to frame <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s own scandalous life. Inscribed in French, one reads: `` Be amorous and you will be happy.'' The other is `` Be mysterious.'' They were obeyed with joyous abandon by <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>, who renounced his family and his prosperous career as a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stockbroker to pursue an artistic vision that led him to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brittany </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> and, finally, the <LOCATION> Marquesas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, where he died in 1903 at the age of 55. The art of <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> as the post-impressionist master and the legend of <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> as the free-spirited libertine are inseparable in the National Gallery's latest blockbuster, the first major exhibition of <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s works in nearly 30 years and the most comprehensive ever held. The show, which took five years to assemble, opened Sunday for a three-month engagement before traveling to the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, where it will be on view from Sept. 17 through Dec. 11, and the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palais </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Jan. 10 through April 20 next year. Admission at the National Gallery is free, but passes are required in anticipation of heavy crowds. The exhibition is underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and by <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The curators focused on the depth and range of <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s art rather than the `` romantic mythology'' surrounding his remarkable personal life. <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s abstract images, flattened sense of space and daring use of color, which he called `` a profound, mysterious language, a language of the dream,'' clearly inspired <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matisse </PERSON> and other 20th century modernists. `` You'll find <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> to be a fabulous and satisfying artist and an enigmatic one,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brettell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> and one of the principal curators of the exhibition. The 243 objects in the show include paintings, sculpture, ceramics, prints and drawings on loan from museums and private collections around the world, from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brettell </PERSON> said Soviet authorities were `` wonderfully cooperative'' in lending 11 paintings from their country's <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> collection _ the most important in the world. Many of the drawing and pictures, including the Soviet entries from the Hermitage Museum at <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pushkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, have never before been displayed in a major exhibition, even in the slightly larger <LOCATION> Gauguin </LOCATION> memorial show that his friends mounted in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1906. But <PERSON> Brettell </PERSON> said two of <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s largest and most highly prized paintings, which the curators `` wanted desperately'' for the National Gallery show, will be absent because they are too fragile to travel. Both painted in <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> in 1898, they are `` <PERSON> Rupe </PERSON>, rupe -LRB- Gathering Fruit -RRB-'' at the Hermitage and `` Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?'' which remains at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. A personal favorite of gallery director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is `` The Siesta,'' which is owned by American publisher <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> and has not been exhibited publicly for a quarter-century. <PERSON> Brettell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON>, curator of 20th century art at the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> to select two wood carvings by <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> from a small museum bearing his name. One was a bowl for eating poi, a fruit paste. The other was the missing section of the decorative door frame which is housed in the Museum d'Orsay in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>, the two curators chartered a two-engine propeller-driven plane for a harrowing, seven-hour flight through tropical storms at low altitudes across more than 900 miles of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to the Marquesas. <PERSON> Bretell </PERSON> calls them `` the most remote islands on earth, the end of civilization in the tropics.'' There they found <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s burial site on the outskirts of a village on <LOCATION> Hivaoa </LOCATION>, the artist's final refuge from the civilizing influence of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> bureaucrats and missionaries who had occupied his beloved <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>, it seems, had carefully cultivated his popular image even to the grave. The headstone he sculpted for himself was his poetic image of an ancient Polynesian spirit called `` Oviri,'' which means `` savage.''

 Five generations of family operation will end when <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its partners complete their $ 1.22 billion buyout of textile giant <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, which made its bid in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, announced Monday that it would pay $ 68.50 a share in cash for the company, which has been run by <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> family members for 175 years The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s rival in the lengthy takeover contest, will purchase $ 530 million in <LOCATION> Stevens </LOCATION> assets from <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> will keep most of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' sheet and towel operations, boosting its share of the home fashion textile market to 25 percent, analysts said. But about $ 170 million of those operations will be sold to <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Bibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to satisfy government antitrust concerns. `` We would like to have -LRB- <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' -RRB- bed and bath business, but we were the ones who proposed what we would divest early on, so it's no surprise, `` said <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON> will get the company's other operations, including its carpet and industrial fabrics plants. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> and Odyssey went three rounds in a weeks-long, heated auction before announcing last week they would work together to draft a joint buyout proposal. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> initially rejected their $ 1.22 billion offer because of concerns about the tentative nature of Odyssey's financing. However, the terms were revised over the weekend to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' satisfaction In the event that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> can not complete its end of the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to purchase <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, subject to financing. Odyssey's outstanding $ 68.50-a-share tender offer has been extended to May 20; <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s offer at the same price will expire May 6, unless extended. In trading Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> rose 25 cents to close at $ 67.75 a share. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s interest in <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has centered exclusively on the company's sheet and towel operations, which include state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities as well as top designer brand names. Those operations account for 60 percent of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' $ 1.61 billion in annual sales <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' towel and sheet lines include the brand names <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gloria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>, among others. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s brands include Arrow, Martex, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burberry </PERSON>. Should further antitrust concerns arise, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has six months to decide whether <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> must sell off a sheeting mill, a yarn plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name. New York-based <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> employs more than 23,000 people, mostly in the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> said he did not anticipate any layoffs at the factory level, but said `` few, if any employees would be needed at the corporate level.'' Analysts agree that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' factories are run efficiently and are producing at near capacity, but that corporate employment is bloated. Many observers were puzzled by <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON>'s aggressive interest in <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The `` greige goods,'' or unfinished fabric operations Odyssey will acquire, are profitable, with sales of about $ 235 million last year. But the carpeting and industrial fabrics business, which had flat 1987 sales of $ 334 million, competes against large, low-cost producers in a cyclical industry, analysts noted. Partner <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> denied analysts' contentions that Odyssey would be forced to cut employees. Odyssey's share includes 26 plants that employ over 9,000 workers with annual revenue topping $ 750 million. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> will acquire 15 plants, and <PERSON> Bibb </PERSON> will get eight plants. Further details were not available. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' own senior management headed by Chairman <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a fifth-generation member of the founding family, put the company in play earlier this year with a leveraged buyout offer. Insiders say management, particularly <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, is upset it will not play a role in the company after the takeover. `` It's not a happy day at <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' headquarters,'' said one source close to the transaction. Meanwhile, representatives of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorneys general met here Monday to discuss their investigation into whether the three companies, in combining their efforts to acquire <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, violated any antitrust laws in determining what price to pay.

<TEXT>
 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities rose in the government's latest auction, with yields on six-month bills hitting the highest level in more than three months. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.92 percent on Monday, up from 5.78 percent last week. Another $ 6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.28 percent, up from 6.14 percent last week. The rates on three-month bills were the highest since April 11, when they sold for 5.98 percent. The rates on six-month bills were the highest since Jan. 19, when rates averaged 6.37 percent. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 6.09 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,850.40 and 6.58 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,682.50. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 7.03 percent last week from 6.92 percent the previous week.

 Domestic auto sales rose slightly during mid-April, although among the biggest automakers only <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> recorded car sales gains in the period. Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks totaled 353,314 from April 11-20, up from 308,240 a year earlier, a 1.9 percent gain in daily sales, domestic automakers reported Monday. There were eight sales days in the period this year and nine days in the period last year. The percentage changes compare average daily sales, not straight totals. The daily sales rate for light trucks rose 3.2 percent, while car sales rose 1.2 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted a 21.4 percent increase in car sales from a soft performance in the year earlier period. Car sales declined 4.4 percent at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and 2.6 percent at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from strong mid-April 1987 periods. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> car sales totaled 112,344 in mid-April, compared with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 65,626 and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 33,842 `` I think that April is going to be a month in which you are going to see auto sales go back to some sort of sustainable rate,'' said <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON>, an industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. She said the easing sales were not surprising after automakers' incentives kept sales brisker than expected for most of the first quarter <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, said sales incentives had pushed industry sales to a 7.6 million seasonally adjusted annual rate in April 1987, a year that ended up averaging a 7.1 million rate. This year's mid-April sales were at a 7.5 million seasonally adjusted annual rate. `` These are good substantial sales, against very strong sales last year,'' <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said. `` It's differences in timing of incentives more than anything else.'' Among foreign manufacturers making cars in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, which moved more production to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, sold 10,738 of its U.S.-made cars in the period, up from 6,488 a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of 2,950 U.S.-made cars represented a 19.3 percent drop in daily sales; <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> sold 1,396, a 17.7 percent increase; and <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> sold 1,375, a 4.7 percent increase.

<HEAD>Belo Reports 59 Percent Earnings Drop In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its earnings declined by 59 percent in the first quarter of 1988 from the same period last year, due to higher operating costs and weak advertising demand. The media company posted a profit of $ 896,000, or 9 cents per share, on revenue of $ 87.3 million during the three months ended March 31. That compared with earnings of $ 2.2 million, or 20 cents per share on revenue of $ 87.5 million in first quarter 1987. Excluding revenue from two <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> radio stations sold in 1987, first quarter revenue would have been up by $ 1.9 million from a year earlier, <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> stated. The company attributed the profit decline to higher broadcast programming costs, higher newsprint costs and weak advertising demand. <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> owns The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dallas-Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suburban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of seven community newspapers. It also owns and operates five network-affiliated television stations. The Dallas Morning News' publishing revenue dipped to $ 50.7 million from $ 50.9 million a year earlier due to a sharply lower volume of advertising, <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> stated. Broadcasting revenue rose only slightly during the quarter, but was up 6.1 percent if revenue from the divested radio stations was excluded, the company said.

<HEAD>Boeing Profit Up 15 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its first quarter profit rose by 15 percent from a year earlier, aided by reduced spending on research, development and new business expenses. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had net earnings of $ 136 million, or 89 cents a share, on sales of $ 3.61 billion in the quarter ended March 31. That compared with a profit of $ 118 million, or 76 cents a share, on sales of $ 3.76 billion for the first quarter of 1987. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief execurive, said the increase in first quarter profits was due primarily to lower levels of research, development and other expenses for new commercial jetliners, future military and space programs, and computer and electronics work. A lower federal income tax rate and increases in other income also helped, he said. <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said the lower expenses were offset partly by higher research, development and production costs for commuter aircraft, performance problems on military aircraft work and a higher share of costs on government contracts. During the first quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> received orders for 129 commercial jets and six de Havilland turboprop planes, with a total value of $ 4.7 billion. That compares with orders totaling $ 3.5 billion in first-quarter 1987. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 1.4 billion order by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leisure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, for 30 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners. That order includes 22 757-200s and eight 737-400s, subject to the completion of financing, and was scheduled for delivery beginning in 1989. Government and foreign military sales fell $ 200 million to $ 1.1 billion for the quarter, but <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said military sales for the year were expected to be slightly higher than in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had a backlog of $ 38 billion in unfinished orders at the end of the first quarter, up from $ 33.2 billion at the end of 1987.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with reports on gross national
product and corporate profits; uppicks 2nd graf pvs: Sales of...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy, shrugging off the effects of the October stock market collapse, grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1988, the government said today. It also said after-tax corporate profits rose an even faster 2.6 percent in the last three months of 1987. This was an upward revision from a month ago, when the government put the increase in business profits at 1.6 percent. A strong increase in consumer spending and the biggest surge in business investment in more than four years fueled the gross national product advance, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, in its first look at overall economic performance this year. The GNP report should put to rest any fears that the record 508-point drop in the stock market on Oct. 19 would topple the country into a recession, economists said. In addition, the rate of inflation slowed, with a price measure tied to the GNP rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. The reports came amid a continuing modest rebound in home sales from a winter slump, a recovery experts say reflects a decline in mortgage interest rates. Sales of existing homes edged up 2.5 percent last month, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said Monday as it reported that single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.33 million units. Despite the March rise, which followed a 2.5 percent increase in February, the rate of sales remained 9.8 percent below that of March 1987. The sales pace had dipped in November, December and January after mortgage rates increased. Meanwhile, trading on financial markets was quiet as investors awaited today's release of first quarter gross national product figures, reflecting the economy's growth rate from January through March. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 22.21 points to 2,037.30. Trading was moderate. The dollar was mixed, and many dealers attributed the currency's behavior partly to uncertainty about the GNP report Bond prices dipped, pushing interest rates higher. The home sales increase was expected to carry over into April, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, the realtors' chief economist. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said interest rates likely would to rise slowly and steadily this year, but predicted the rise would disrupt sales less than the sharp jumps by interest rates in 1987. A year ago, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages bottomed out at just above 9 percent. They rose in spurts, topping 11.5 percent in early October. Rates eased after the stock market crash, dipping just below 10 percent in February and March before rising again to 10.3 percent last week. The March sales increase was accompanied by a 4.1 percent rise in prices to a national median, or midpoint, of $ 88,700, from $ 88,100 in February. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted only modest increases for the rest of the year.

 The government's case against three men accused of defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is as shaky as a broken three-legged stool, a defense attorney contends. `` If any leg is missing, it wo n't stand up, and at any point in this case, one or more of the legs are missing.'' said attorney <PERSON> Burck </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, former head of oil and gas lending at the failed <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

Between July 1981 and 1982, when the alleged fraud scheme took place, `` there was the widely held view that oil and gas prices would rise so quickly that time would take care of any problems with these loans,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> vice president, was accused of taking kickbacks in exchange for funding high-risk energy loans from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> customers. The government also contended <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> engaged in an investment scheme in which <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> inflated the return on <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s investment threefold so he could receive a favorable loan from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> never received the loan but made several attempts, according to court records. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Helwig </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, a 20-year employee at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, as a bank officer who needed the money because he was living well beyond his means. `` He had become so completely dependent on <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, he no longer had the interest of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> first and foremost,'' <PERSON> Helwig </PERSON> added. The indictment cited <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s involvement in $ 44 million in loans made by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to 12 Penn Square customers. It did not say how much was recovered by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank, which came to the brink of collapse in 1984 in part because of its troubled energy loans. The loans to customers of <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, which failed in July 1982, were approved at about the same time <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> received nearly $ 600,000 in kickbacks from <LOCATION> Patterson </LOCATION> in the form of unsecured personal loans from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Helwig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, impassive during government arguments, took notes Monday. He sat facing the jury, wearing a brown suit and scuffed penny loafers _ one with a hole in the sole. His attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Streicker </PERSON>, noted that even when <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials began reviewing <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s potential conflict-of-interest no one told him to stop making loans to <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> customers. `` Because in spite of all the problems, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> wanted the business,'' <PERSON> Streicker </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is launching an effort to persuade rival oil producers to help push up prices because the cartel is convinced it can no longer control world oil markets by itself. Oil ministers from five of the 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> meet tonight with representatives of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and five other non-OPEC oil producers to discuss possible production cuts. The meeting will mark the widest participation of non-cartel oil exporters in direct talks with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in history. But many industry analysts say they see little chance of a firm accord this week on joint output cuts. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers gathered at the cartel's headquarters in central <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> at midday today to lay the groundwork for the joint meeting set for tonight. <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the Nigerian oil minister and president of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, offered no details of the meeting's agenda as he entered the building. `` We hope to have a good meeting, a useful meeting,'' he told reporters. Other officials declined to comment. World oil prices have been falling as supplies exceed demand. Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was not represented, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to talk with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> officials. The commission regulates that state's 2 million barrels a day of oil production. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said in an interview today he had met with <PERSON> Fadhil </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalabi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> deputy secretary general, and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> staff on Monday. `` The main thing is to establish a dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members, he said. `` The main message we'd like to get across is stability'' for oil prices. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy has been severely hurt by the sharp decline in oil prices over the past two years. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> declined to be specific when asked whether he would suggest to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> the possibility of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> imposing restraints on oil production in the state. But <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Oilgram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based industry newsletter, quoted him Tuesday as saying he `` could n't make a deal on production even if -LRB- he -RRB- wanted to,'' and that, in such a case, the other two railroad commissioners and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> governor would have to be consulted. `` The Saudis seem to be very much against any oil production cuts,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, an analyst in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mackenzie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, said on Monday. He said in a telephone interview that one reason for the Saudi reluctance may be to avoid allowing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to use increased revenues from higher oil prices to strengthen its stand in the war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Saudis indirectly support <LOCATION> Irag </LOCATION> in the war that began in September 1980. On Sunday, Iranian naval gunboats attacked a Saudi-owned tanker in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> decided earlier this month to invite eight non-cartel oil exporters to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, saying a broader base of nations must bear the burden of production restraint if prices are to return to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s declared target of $ 18 a barrel Most <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil is selling for at least $ 2 a barrel less than the target price. The non-OPEC countries participating in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting are <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. Their production totals about 8 million barrels a day, although their combined exports are believed to be less than half that. In 1984 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> began inviting representatives of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and other smaller producers to observe <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meetings. In March 1986 it held direct negotiations with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and four other independent producers but no agreement was reached on production cuts.

If BNS were able to consummate its offer, those shares plus the 2.1 million BNS already holds, would give it 56.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' stock. But BNS is barred by two federal court orders from actually purchasing more shares unless and until legal challenges to its offer are overturned.

 Early contract negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> have soured but remain alive, despite a `` no-show'' protest by union representatives and other frictions inside and outside of actual bargaining. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> negotiators and union leaders scheduled to begin this week's meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> on Monday morning instead met privately for four hours and debated whether to continue the talks, said <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> While <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s team cooled its heels, union negotiators discussed the rank-and-file's angry reaction to several announcements last week _ such as disclosure of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s eight-figure wages for 1987 _ that seemed timed to doom the talks. `` The talks may be in fatal trouble already but it's a little too early to tell,'' said <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON>, labor and technology expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The union and the No. 3 automaker are negotiating a replacement for a contract expiring Sept. 14. The contract covers at least 66,000 active and laid-off workers in 15 states and 65,000 retirees. Angering the rank and file were revelations of executive compensation for 1987 that included nearly $ 18 million for <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, and the planned transfer of waning K-car production from two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants to one in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1989. The union will urge <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> to keep producing K-cars _ the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliant </ORGANIZATION> _ at its <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> vice president and head of the union's <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> department. The Jefferson Avenue plant produces four-door K-cars while a <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> factory produces two-door models. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to move <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> and Horizon production from a plant it is closing in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to the Jefferson Avenue Plant this summer and said last week it would consolidate K-car production in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said union officials think the plant can produce both cars. `` We would urge the corporation to change its plan,'' he said. At the bargaining table, talks that were supposed to last two to three weeks as the two sides fit an industry-pattern contract to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> began to drag as <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> made proposals guaranteed to be rejected. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> has publicly said he will work within the job-protecting pattern contract already in force at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but union officials say <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bargainers are strongly resisting it. `` They have not come up with any pattern proposals. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s first offer is garbage _ all take-aways We're not going to take any concessions,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFrancesco </PERSON>, an official at <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 624 in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> DeFrancesco </PERSON> was among nearly 100 officials of local unions at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plants nationwide who gathered in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, Thursday night and Friday. At the meeting, the local leaders heard and booed company proposals and urged bargainers to break off talks, according to <PERSON> DeFrancesco </PERSON> and others who attended. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> said he still believed the two sides would reach an early settlement, which had been intended to mend their damaged relationship. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> seeks a minimum age for early retirement instead of the current `` 30-and-out'' provision, which is the right to retire after 30 years in the factory regardless of age. It wants workers to take vacations only when plants are shut down, or lose them and wants workers who do n't join pre-paid health plans to pay $ 35 a month in insurance fees. The automaker also wants widespread adoption of Japanese-style plant work agreements at a time when some plants that have accepted them are hitting snags in putting the so-called Modern Operating Agreements into practice. Workers who made deep sacrifices that helped save <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s expected a return to normality once <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> returned to profitability. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> early this year announced plans to close a 5,500-worker former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, that it had said would stay open at least five more years. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s later attempt to sell its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> met with strike threats and other strong union opposition.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, shrugging off the effects of the October stock market collapse, grew at a respectable 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1988, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, issuing its first look at overall economic performance this year, said the increase in the gross national product was propelled by a strong increase in consumer spending and the biggest surge in business investment in more than four years. Economists said the balanced growth was good news for Republicans in an election year and should bury lingering fears that the 508-point drop in the stock market on Oct. 19 would topple the country into a recession. `` This report presents a good, healthy picture of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy in the first quarter, nothing near a recession despite all the earlier worries,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is good political reading for the Republicans.'' The administration wasted no time in boasting about the GNP report. `` So much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the first quarter,'' Commerce Under Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said at a briefing for reporters. `` Today's report shows the economy entering its sixth year of expansion with inflation remaining moderate.'' In further good news, the growth was accompanied by a slowdown in the rate of inflation, with a price measure tied to the GNP rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. This slowdown should help allay fears that stronger consumer demand would push up prices and force the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to raise interest rates to cool off demand. The GNP grew at a much faster 4.8 percent rate in the October-December quarter, but analysts said that growth masked some dangerous imbalances that were not present in the first quarter report. Almost all of the fourth quarter increase in GNP wound up as unsold inventory sitting on shelves. At the same time, consumer spending was taking a rare nose dive, falling by 2.5 percent, the biggest drop in seven years. This combination has in the past been a harbinger of a recession. This pattern was reversed in the first quarter with business inventories, which had risen by $ 39.4 billion in the fourth quarter, falling by $ 13.2 billion in the first quarter, indicating a success by businesses in reducing swollen inventories. Much of the success in working down the inventory bulge occurred in auto showrooms, as dealers were aided by a new round of sales incentives. This helped boost consumer spending by $ 23.6 billion in the first quarter, a 3.8 percent annual rate of increase. The report said more than half of that growth came in auto sales. Business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual rate of 32.5 percent in the first quarter, the fastest advance since a 39.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983. In other good news, the country's trade deficit, after removing the effects of inflation, narrowed by $ 3.6 billion in the first quarter, continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid-1986. The administration, which is forecasting that GNP will grow 2.9 percent for the full year, is counting on further improvements in the trade deficit to supply almost half of GNP growth this year. Much of the rest of the increase is expected to come from higher business capital spending as companies expand production facilities to meet a growing export demand. Both of those trends were evident in today's GNP report, providing good news for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which is counting on a sixth straight year of economic growth to boost chances for a Republican presidential win in November. In another report, the government said that after-tax corporate profits rose an even faster 2.6 percent in the final three months of 1987. This was an upward revision from a month ago, when the government put the increase in business profits at 1.6 percent. Two factors that held back GNP growth in the first quarter were a 9.4 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 22.3 percent drop in spending by the federal government, reflecting in large part a swing in farm subsidy payments. The various changes pushed the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, up by $ 21.8 billion, to a new annual rate of $ 3.90 trillion. The first quarter growth was welcome news when compared to forecasts being made at the beginning of the year. At the time, some analysts were actually predicting that the GNP would decline in the first quarter, signalling the start of a new recession. The pessimists believed that a combination of the shock to consumer confidence from the stock market collapse and the huge overhang of business inventories would severely depress economic activity in the early part of this year. The fear was that after a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth, nervous consumers would stop spending and manufacturers, caught with huge inventories of unsold goods, would cut back on production and lay off workers. But, those events did not occur. Instead of cutting back after the market turmoil, employers actually boosted hiring. Since October, an average of 362,000 new jobs have been added to the economy each month, more than twice the size of the monthly gains before the crash. The big gains in employment helped restore consumer confidence, considered critical for the economy's health since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is predicting that the GNP will expand at a 2.9 percent annual rate this year, marking the third consecutive year the economy has grown at this rate. This view is in line with the outlook of many private forecasters as well. Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a <LOCATION> Sedona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> newsletter, said that its latest survey of 51 top economists found a consensus forecast for growth of 2.7 percent this year, up significantly from a 1.9 percent GNP estimate made in the month following the market crash.

 Stock prices pushed ahead today, extending their advance of the past three sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose more than 20 points on Monday, was up another 16.91 points at 2,052.88 after 90 minutes of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by 3 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 940 up, 303 down and 491 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 50.58 million shares as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Before trading started, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the the economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1988. That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-December quarter, but was in line with most economists' forecasts for the January-March period. The report also said the rate of inflation had slowed, with a price measure tied to the GNP rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Analysts said the report contained little that was unexpected, and said it had little effect on the movement of stock prices.

<HEAD>Major Step Forward in Steel Casting Measured in Inches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An industry that weighs its products by the millions of tons and totals its sales in the billions of dollars is measuring one of steelmaking's most promising technical breakthroughs by the inch. `` The potential is there to shake up this industry,'' analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> says of a machine that eliminates several major steps in the shaping, or casting, of liquid steel into slabs for further processing. Like other advances, thin-slab casting has the potential to reduce production costs, including labor. It also gives minimills _ smaller scrap-melting steelmakers _ an opening to markets dominated by the giant integrated companies that produce finished steel from ore. The German firm <ORGANIZATION> SMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schloemann-Siemag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> has developed a caster that spits out a ribbon of steel two inches thick _ much thinner than the 10-inch-thick strands produced by today's slab casters. The eight inches gained may not seem like much. But they're a world of difference to anyone who ever had to hammer a thick hunk of steel into a strip one-tenth of an inch thick or paid to have that done by the thousands of tons per day as major steelmakers do in conventional hot strip mills. Roughly half of all the steel produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> passes through hot strip mills, which convert thick slabs of metal into thinner sheets that are used to make such things as car fenders, office furniture and appliances. SMS says its thin-slab casting process was tested in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with good results and offers savings in machinery, energy, time and labor, all of which mean money. <ORGANIZATION> Nucor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> hopes to reap those savings at a new plant in <LOCATION> Crawfordsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where SMS is preparing the first commercial thin-slab caster for a production start next April. `` They've achieved things that people did n't expect them to,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappmeyer </PERSON>, vice president of research and technology for <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the nation's No 1 and No. 3 steelmakers, respectively, aborted a $ 30 million, federally funded development program after SMS announced its breakthrough more than a year ago. `` We were scooped,'' he said. <PERSON> Kappmeyer </PERSON> said thin-slab casting has been an ambition of steelmakers since the 19th century, when a patent for a similar caster design was granted to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessemer </PERSON>, the English engineer whose namesake furnace was the first high-tonnage steelmaking process used by the industry. Until now, the thinnest slabs possible on a continuous caster were six inches, with 10-inch slabs more common. `` People are struggling to get down ... to six inches. So to go from 10 inches to two inches is enormous. It is an unknown territory,,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fastert </PERSON>, president of the German company's <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, N.J.-based subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> SMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The limiting factor had been the caster's water-cooled copper mold, which shapes the molten steel while cooling the surface enough to hold the shape as the metal moves through continuously. In conventional molds, the intake and output openings are the same size. The `` ingenious idea'' that SMS engineers had was to use a funnel-shaped mold and to put the steel through at faster rate, 250 inches per minute compared to 60 inches in conventional molds, <PERSON> Fastert </PERSON> said. `` The principle is so simple people said it's crazy,'' he said. `` It is crazy to suggest you do it in a funnel, because when it gets stuck in the funnel and you pull it out and it breaks, all your steel will run out. You lose three or four tons of liquid steel all over your equipment. `` If you do it fast enough, you can do what at slow speed you could never achieve,'' <PERSON> Fastert </PERSON> said. `` I liken it to water skiiing. If you do n't have the courage to go fast, you'll never get out of the water.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nucor </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in the new caster fits the style of the lean and aggressive <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, company, one of the efficient minimill operators that helped rebuff cheap imports of concrete reinforcing bar and other low-value products. `` We've always made an effort to use the latest technology,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Nucor </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON>. The innovative caster will help <ORGANIZATION> Nucor </ORGANIZATION> break into the market for flat-rolled steel sheet, which had been the province of integrated companies whose excess capacity led to cut-throat competition through most of this decade. `` When you go into a market that has overcapacity, you've got to be prepared to push somebody else out,'' <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said. `` You've got to have a competitive advantage.'' The <LOCATION> Crawfordsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, caster, <ORGANIZATION> Nucor </ORGANIZATION>'s edge, will be coupled with a streamlined mill to produce flat-rolled steel. The plant will cost $ 230 million `` compared to a billion for an integrated hot strip mill,'' he said. SMS says the quality of its thin-cast strip meets or beats conventionally produced steel, and <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said he expects to lop $ 50 to $ 75 off the average price of $ 400 per ton for strip. `` This is the first time that a minimill has been built for flat-rolled products,'' <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said. `` There's just a whole group of people who are looking at it and watching us.'' The entry of a minimill operator into flat-rolled steel may not faze some of the giants of the industry, but lesser competitors could be challenged, analysts say. `` None of this is going to be a problem for the first few years, but I know six people who want to buy the second'' SMS caster, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said.

 They're relatively young, they wear jeans and support the anti-nuclear movement _ but swear their new bank, the first of its kind in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, will be as financially sound as any other. Set to open Tuesday -LRB- May 2 -RRB-, the <LOCATION> Oekobank </LOCATION> _ or <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> _ will adhere to a new kind of political and environmental conscience. The Oekobank will support projects such as alternative energy development, pesticide-free agriculture, and women's self-help centers, but eschew investments linked with, for example, the arms industry or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Dubbed the `` bankers in tennis shoes'' by the national press, the informally dressed, leftist-oriented crew stresses it's still adhering to traditional, profit-making goals. `` The main difference between the <LOCATION> Oekobank </LOCATION> and regular banks is our stance on political and environmental issues. But our working methods are the same,'' Oekobank spokesman <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 34, said. `` Good intentions are fine, but the numbers have to balance,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> added, speaking in German. All nine staff members have years of bank or economics training and experience behind them. Director <PERSON> Hans-Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiner </PERSON>, 40, has served on the board of directors at two banks. The Oekobank is drawing considerable media attention, including recent articles in leading newsmagazine <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> and the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. `` The ecology bankers want a new type of money house that offers customers a chance they would n't get in the big institutions,'' <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said in a March 21 article. The <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> banking establishment, including the mighty <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, has so far declined to comment publicly about the upstart institution. `` The established banks certainly do n't regard us as competition,'' <PERSON> Schreiner </PERSON> said. The Oekobank, with about 7.7 million marks -LRB- $ 4.5 million -RRB- of equity capital, will be a Lilliputian among financial institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has about 9.7 billion marks of capital -LRB- $ 5.7 billion -RRB-. The Oekobank's only office is located in the homey neighborhood of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, blocks away from the glittering towers of the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kommerzbank </LOCATION>, and other giants in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s high-powered financial center <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s overseeing body for banks, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, gave the Oekobank its final approval on March 7, but imposed several restrictions. The Oekobank, for example, will limit its credit volume to three times the amount of its equity capital, although the law allows banks to issue credit up to 18 times that amount, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Restrictions were necessary partly because the <LOCATION> Oekobank </LOCATION> has not been accepted into a deposit protection fund, a fund among banks which acts as a sort of insurance for bank customers. Several innovations will enable the <LOCATION> Oekobank </LOCATION> to put its political and environmental ideals into practice, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. One will allow customers to invest in savings certificates linked to specific environmental or social causes. Another enables borrowers to form a guarantors' pool for loans. For example, 10 people wishing to start a business could take out a loan of 50,000 marks, each person guaranteeing 5,000. `` Many banks would n't spend the additional time needed to administer such an arrangement,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The Oekobankers may prove there is a market gap in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for a bank with a liberal conscience. Enthusiasm for the environmentalist causes of the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, for example, is still running strong, and thousands of protestors regularly show up for nuclear disarmament demonstrations. But the ecology bankers say they are independent of political parties, despite having regional <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> groups among their backers and a ranking Social Democrat federal parliamentary deputy on the board of directors. `` We're not a Greens party bank, or a bank only for liberals or the little man,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` Environmental destruction, the arms build-up, and disasters like Chernobyl are affecting people of all classes and political beliefs.'' Oekobankers are also tapping into the ever-growing area of `` alternative'' businesses, a broad variety of companies often headed by young entrepreneurs, and based on collective ownership. `` We'll be there for unconventional entrepreneurs whose ideas are often rejected by established banks,'' <PERSON> Schreiner </PERSON> said. But the <ORGANIZATION> Oekobank </ORGANIZATION> will also help customers with non-political causes such as car payments and home repairs, he said.

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This bustling city, the largest, richest and most industrialized in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, rode into the 20th century on a wave of suds from <LOCATION> Carta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION>, the beer that made <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> famous. It's the granddaddy of all Mexican beers, a golden brew that helped turn a small brewery into a major corporation and a sleepy town into an industrial giant. <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> has come a long way since the fledgling Cuauhtemoc Brewery first put a cap on a bottle of <LOCATION> Carta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION> nearly a century ago. A sprawling city of 2.8 million people today, <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> had just 40,000 inhabitants and a few small factories in 1890 when a group of local investors started the brewery, named for the last Aztec emperor, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> _ pronounced Cwow-tay' `` It was contagious,'' said the historian and author <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. `` The enthusiasm to create other industries caught on.'' The brewery's needs were large at the turn of the century and it was n't easy to get raw materials from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> 600 miles to the south or from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 150 miles north. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>'s directors created departments to manufacture the raw materials: malt, glass to make bottles, tin for caps, paper for labels, cardboard for cases. Those departments spawned seven incorporated industries that later became catalysts for the major industrial conglomerates Visa, <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> and Vitro. `` The brewery was the cornerstone of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>'s industrial development,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Montemayor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>'s planning director. The brewery, now a division of <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION>, started operations with 72 workers in a house in what is now downtown <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. It produced 1,500 bottles of <LOCATION> Carta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION> the first year. By 1987, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>'s seven breweries throughout <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had 4,409 employees producing about 1 billion quarts of beer each year. In addition to <PERSON> Carta </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanca </PERSON>, still one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most popular beers, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> makes <LOCATION> Tecate </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> beers, its best-selling export products. Its premium <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION> brand won first prize among 35 domestic and foreign lager beers in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> beer-tasting contest last summer. If <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> launched what is known as the `` <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> phenomenon'' _ the unique industrial development of a city so far from the nation's capital _ it also led the way in social and educational development programs for employees. Before the government created a federal medical program, families of Cuauhtemoc employees were receiving free medical care at company clinics. Before the federal government started low-cost housing programs, the company was helping its employees build their homes. In 1912 the brewery founded <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cuauhtemoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which offered primary level classes to employees' children during the day and to workers at night. The <ORGANIZATION> Monterrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, now one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s leading universities, developed from the school. Today, the brewery also provides free dental care, low-interest loans, savings programs and university scholarships. Its sports and cultural center sponsors soccer teams and offers classes in swimming, karate, singing, dancing and guitar. <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, whose grandfather came to <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> in the early 1930s to take a job at the Cuauhtemoc brewery, is the third generation of Larsens to work here. `` The company does n't think just about production. It's concerned with people, too,'' said the 22-year-old systems analyst whose father was <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>'s production chief `` It's like a family here,'' he said. `` And the pay is better than at other companies.'' Salaries for laborers start 30 percent higher than <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>'s daily minimum wage of 7,405 pesos, about $ 3.20 The current economic crisis, however, has been tough on the local beer industry, and the brewery is operating at a loss. In 1983, the year after the crisis began, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>'s domestic sales dropped by nearly 1.3 million cases as consumers watched their salaries eaten up by soaring inflation. Last year, however, the brewery achieved pre-crisis production levels and is negotiating with foreign creditors to restructure debts while pushing exports to generate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. Although the immense popularity of Corona Extra beer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>'s main competitor, the Modelo brewery, even stronger, planning director <PERSON> Montemayor </PERSON> said his company is reaping some benefits from it. `` <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s success has helped us, too. It's made the American consumer more aware of Mexican beer,'' he said. An aggressive sales and distribution campaign, coupled with a new American thirst for Mexican beer, has helped Cuauhtemoc more than double its exports sales since the economic crisis began. In 1987 <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> exported 4.7 million cases of beer, generating $ 29.2 million. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>, with 33 percent of the domestic beer market, is the second largest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s three beer manufacturers after the Modelo brewery. In 1985, the financially troubled <PERSON> Moctezuma </PERSON> brewery was acquired by <PERSON> Visa </PERSON>'s holding company <ORGANIZATION> Fomento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Proa </ORGANIZATION> in an exchange of stock that prevented Modelo from acquiring it and becoming a force too large to deal with in the Mexican beer industry, said <PERSON> Montemayor </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Texaco Says 1st Quarter Earnings Doubled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest oil company, today announced that its first-quarter earnings rose by 105 percent compared with the same period last year. The <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company said it earned $ 242 million, or $ 1.00 per share, on $ 8.7 billion of revenue, vs. $ 118 million, or 49 cents per share, on $ 8.5 billion in 1987 first-quarter sales. The latest earnings included a $ 66 million gain on the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in an offshore <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> joint venture, as well as $ 29 million gain on foreign currency transactions, which compared with a $ 7 million loss in the same period last year, the company said. It also included an increase of corporate and nonoperating charges to $ 249 million from $ 100 million in the 1987 first quarter. That hike was due in part `` to the recognition in the 1987 quarter of $ 73 million in nonrecurring benefits relating to prior years income tax adjustments,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The legal and related costs associated with the bankruptcy proceedings and the financing expenses incident to the company's ultimate emergence from Chapter 11 also contributed to the increase in corporate expenses,'' the company said Otherwise, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said its performance was helped by improved domestic refining and marketing margins and strong petrochemical results. Slumping crude prices were offset by improved earnings from natural gas operations due to settlement of certain take-or-pay issues and higher natural gas sales prices and volumes, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from Chapter 11 earlier this month in a reorganization that included a $ 3 billion payment to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to settle a $ 10.3 judgment held against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> resulting from a jury's decision that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had improperly interfered with a <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> acquisition of part of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots are suing the airline, its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union in an effort to strike down contract provisions they say could block an employee takeover of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit was filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON>, a union spokesman. The suit challenges two provisions in a November agreement between <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. `` We want a judgment from the court to declare that these provisions are illegal, so we can move forward in our attempts to affect employee ownership of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. One provision prohibits the union from participating in an employee ownership plan unless the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union agrees to the terms. The other contested provision would give the Machinists the option of receiving substantial pay increases, reopening their contract or striking in the event of a change in control of <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION>. The pilots' lawsuit alleges that the provisions, called `` protective covenants,'' are part of an illegal campaign by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> directors to `` entrench themselves in office at the expense of <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' the union stated. `` We have n't seen the suit so we have no comment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the provisions addressed in the suit are part of a three-year agreement between the company and the union regarding work and wage rules. `` Details of it are n't for public consumption,'' he said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union could not be reached for comment Monday night. United pilots have been working toward an employee takeover for about a year, but the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union has opposed the plan. United pilots made an unsuccessful $ 4.5 billion bid for the airline last April, opposing <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION>' diversification into a travel services conglomerate. The offer led to a proxy fight by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor group, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, to unseat <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> directors, and <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> later resigned. <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> directors agreed to sell the company's hotel and rental car businesses and to drop the <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> name as part of a $ 3.65 billion restructuring plan.

 The stock market moved broadly higher today, as a new government report indicated the economy continues to show some strength. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points on Monday, rose another 14.10 points to 2,050.07 by noon on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 948 up, 368 down and 512 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 74.44 million shares as of noontime compared with 87.93 million shares at the same point Monday. Before trading started, the government reported that the the economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1988. That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-December quarter, but fell well within most forecasts. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, a technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said that even though the latest growth figure had been anticipated, the market took some encouragement from it anyway. `` It was n't too low to dim hopes that the economic recovery would continue,'' he said. He also noted that the dollar and bond prices seem to have stabilized in recent days, and said that has helped the psychology of some stock investors. The market has also benefitted in recent days from some strong corporate earnings reports.

 The number of Americans manufacturing things for a living has fallen in this decade, although such areas as transportation equipment, plastics and furniture are bucking the trend, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Overall, employment in manufacturing businesses fell by 731,900 between 1982 and 1986, the bureau said. That represented a decline of 4 percent, to 17,086,200 workers, according to preliminary statistics from the 1986 Annual Survey of Manufactures. More recently, however, manufacturing employment has been increasing as the devalued dollar boosts sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods abroad. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturing jobs rose by 400,000 between June 1987 and March 1988, a period not covered by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s survey. Between 1982 and 1986, the hardest-hit sector was machinery manufacturing, which lost 325,700 jobs. Imports were a major reason for the 15 percent decline to 1,863,000 employees in businesses making heavy industrial and construction machinery, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> analyst. Another area affected by imported products in recent years _ apparel and textile products _ saw employment fall 14 percent to 1,016,500 in 1986. That represented a loss of 172,500 jobs, the report said. Primary metal industries also suffered, losing 164,900 jobs to fall to a total of 689,200 in 1986. Manufacture of leather goods saw a loss of 70,000 jobs, representing a 35 percent decline to 1986 employment of 129,800. Tobacco products suffered a 20 percent job loss between 1982 and 1986, with employment falling to 46,100 in the continuation of a 20-year trend. On the positive side, companies making transportation equipment added 173,600 workers over the period, an 11 percent increase to 1,769,500. Transportation equipment is a wide-ranging field including aircraft, trucks and trailers, automobiles, ships, motor homes and even some defense equipment such as missiles, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Computer products have helped boost employment in electronic industries slightly, the study showed. That area employed 1,941,400 people in 1986, up 26,900 from 1982. Printing and publishing added 84,400 people over the period and wood products and furniture-making also showed growth. Nationally, while total employment in manufacturing fell between 1982 and 1986, payroll was up from $ 204.5 billion to $ 231.7 billion. Here is a rundown of industry groups, employment in 1986 and change from 1982: _ All industries: 17,086,200, down 731,900 Gainers: _ Transportation equipment, 1,769,500, up 173,600 _ Printing and publishing, 1,376,200, up 84,400 _ Rubber and plastics products, 741,300, up 59,600 _ Lumber and wood products, 619,500, up 43,100 _ Furniture and fixtures, 466,700, up 30,700 _ Electric and electronic equipment, 1,941,400, up 26,900 Losers: _ Machinery, except electrical, 1,863,000, down 325,700 _ Apparel and other textile products, 1,016,500, down 172,500 _ Primary metal industries, 689,200, down 164,900 _ Food and kindred products: 1,408,900, down 78,800 _ Textile mill products, 644,300, down 73,100 _ Chemicals and allied products, 801,600, down 71,000 _ Leather and leather products, 129,800, down 70,000 _ Miscellaneous manufacturing, 326,100, down 56,500 _ Fabricated metal products, 1,419,500, down 40,200 _ Instruments and related products, 585,400, down 38,200 _ Petroleum and coal products, 124,500, down 27,100 _ Stone, clay and glass products, 514,100, down 17,400 _ Tobacco products, 46,100, down 11,800 _ Paper and allied products, 602,600, down 3,000

 <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to virtually halt construction of new 7-Eleven convenience stores for the immediate future and use operating cash to repay debt on the founding family's leveraged buyout completed in December.

Despite the shift in strategy following the <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> family's $ 4.9 billion leveraged buyout, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> will continue to operate about 7,500 convenience stores in 1988, about 3,000 more than closest competitor <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> Circle K earlier this month purchased 473 7-Eleven stores for $ 162 million and bought 538 stores from the Charter Co.

 Stock prices rose sharply Tuesday as a buoyant <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market injected added confidence into <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, which already was bullish on takeover news. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 23.2 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,800.8.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its first-quarter profit soared from a year ago mainly because of a huge gain on the sale of its cellular telephone operations in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The company said its profit rose to $ 144.8 million, or $ 11.25 a share, in the quarter compared with $ 18.6 million, or $ 1.45 a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose 7.7 percent to $ 321.2 million from $ 298.4 million a year earlier. The latest results included a non-recurring, after-tax gain of $ 115.7 million from the sale of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cellular telephone operations. Without that gain, the company said its first quarter results would have risen 56.3 percent to $ 29.1 million, or $ 2.26 a share. Both newspaper division and television stations revenue were up 10 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. It said cable TV revenue increased 17 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter revenue was up by 4 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travenol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported that its profit jumped 38 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, boosted by improved sales. The manufacturer of health care products and equipment said Tuesday that its first-quarter profit rose to $ 91 million, or 31 cents a share, from $ 66 million, or 22 cents a share, in the first three months of 1987. Sales expanded 12 percent, to more than $ 1.6 billion, including $ 355 million in international sales. The dollar's weakness against major foreign currencies contributed about $ 41 million to international sales during the quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travenol </ORGANIZATION> said. A lower dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more competitive abroad. Sales of hospital products and services, the company's largest business, contributed $ 880 million to revenue.

<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices rose sharply in late trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, closing as much as 18 cents higher. The late surge on heavy trading volume followed comments made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official that farmers signing up for price support programs had agreed to take 3.5 million acres out of corn production instead of the 1.5 million acres that the market had anticpated, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The acreage could not be used for soybean production, which adds new tension to a market already stressed by fears of tight supplies. `` That was the catalyst,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. He said speculation that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> might be offered 50,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil under a subsidized export program added further fuel to the soybean rally. Corn and wheat futures advanced in sympathy with soybeans, analysts said. At the close, wheat was -RCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.12 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.00 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 1.65 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 16 cents to 18 cents higher with May at $ 6.77 a bushel.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor and television game show magnate <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, whose sucesses include `` The Dating Game,'' wants a match that will last with <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But the family that controls the media empire through a special class of stock hopes shareholders will give <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s $ 1.6 billion takeover bid the cutoff treatment accorded many contestants on another <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> program _ `` The Gong Show.'' The takeover fight under way in advance of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s May 20 shareholders meeting has been waged on three fronts _ in court, in proxy materials and in newspaper advertisements. The battle is being monitored closely by major publishers including the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, among other media companies that have dual classes of stock intended to keep control in the hands of a few people. The <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> family is seeking to tighten its grip on <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> with a charter change to be voted on next month in reaction to the bid for Media General. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, through two companies he heads, offered in February to pay $ 61.50 a share for the nearly 90 percent of Media General stock he does not control. But the family of Media General Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> declined the offer, expressing a desire to keep the Richmond-based company independent. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> controls just over 10 percent of the 28 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s Class A common stock. But the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> family owns 71 percent of the more powerful 559,168 outstanding Class B shares, which elect seven of the company's 10 directors. In lawsuits filed last month in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, Media General accused <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> of inciting speculation in the company's stock. Management also wants the court to order <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> to sell his shares. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, meanwhile, asked the court to allow <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to vote as a single class on his offer and maintained only the three Class A directors should be allowed to consider the buyout. Media General's management contends the buyout requires approval of two-thirds of each class voting separately, but <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> says a majority vote of the combined Class A and B shares is all that is necessary for ratification. A hearing is set for Wednesday in the court dispute. After the suits were filed, <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> placed full-page ads in The Wall Street Journal and two Media General daily newspapers, the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader. The ads criticized the company's two-tier stock arrangement and asked shareholders not to vote on management's proxy statement until receiving <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s proposals. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> also is seeking to be elected to <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s board along with his allies, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotterer </PERSON>, vice chairman of the two <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> companies that control the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> stock, <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Harleyville </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> S.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> last week launched its own newspaper ad attack in which it urged shareholders to back the company's slate of Class A directors. The ads also advised shareholders against acting on <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s $ 61.50-per-share offer. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of the Times-Dispatch and News Leader, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> also owns the <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 32 weekly newspapers in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a 40 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 18 dailies and four weeklies in eight states.

The holding company will hold 60 percent of both <PERSON> Piaget </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Baume </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, and the <PERSON> Piaget </PERSON> family will retain the remaining interest in each company. Both <PERSON> Piaget </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Baume </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, which are owned by the <PERSON> Piaget </PERSON> family, will retain their management `` at least for the time being,'' <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said. The move follows a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the international luxury goods business, with further consolidation likely in the watchmaking industry. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> disclosed <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> hopes within the next year to gain a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Ebel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, another Swiss watchmaker. He also said discussions are underway with two other privately-owned European luxury goods companies with a view to expanding <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION>'s market share in other product lines, but he declined to give details. In addition to watches, <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> is known for its jewelry, cigarette lighters, luxury leather goods and perfumes. <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> is 46.8 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Rothmans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sofina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> group of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> hold up to 18 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> would not identify other <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. <PERSON> Cartier </PERSON>'s consolidated sales jumped by 36.8 percent last year to $ 680 million from $ 497 million in 1986, while aggregate sales of <PERSON> Piaget </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Baume </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> were up 15 percent to $ 161.9 million. <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> has never disclosed its earnings, but <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said the company's sales could reach $ 840 million this year. <PERSON> Piaget </PERSON>, which initiated the takeover talks with <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION>, holds the No. 1 position for luxury watch sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> despite a sales slump that hit the sector in 1986, <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said.

 The stock market posted some modest gains today, although it gave back some of the morning's advance during afternoon trading. The market gained strength through most of the morning, but retreated in the early afternoon before advancing once again in the final hour. Trading was relatively light. Before the market opened, the government reported that the the economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1988. That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-December quarter, but the growth estimate fell well within most forecasts. Analysts said the market has taken some encouragement from the fact that the economy has not bogged down as some had feared after last October's crash. But they noted that many individual investors remain leery about getting back into the market because of the volatility that has followed the crash.

 Contract talks between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> appeared back on track Tuesday after a week of rank-and-file pressure that led to a <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> boycott of the talks a day earlier. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> opened separate talks Tuesday with local union leaders from <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, over the closing of a 5,500-worker assembly plant and a pact covering 1,000 workers at a remaining engine plant. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 72 President <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Steagall </PERSON> and Chairman <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON>, along with national <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> representatives, were meeting with a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> team led by union relations manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON>. The talks were moved from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to make it easier for the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> to handle the negotiations. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> also is bargaining with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>' Land Systems Division and several battery companies. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced early this year that it will close by year's end a former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> but leave open a neighboring engine plant The announcement angered workers and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> officials who had assumed <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> would be a strong provider of jobs. At the national contract negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> continued talking Tuesday in an atmosphere that improved after a protest Monday by <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> bargainers, who boycotted the talks for several hours. Union bargainers had debated whether to break off the early negotiations because of what they considered disruptive announcements the previous week, including <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s $ 18 million 1987 earnings. Rank-and-file members also were angered by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to halt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of its Dodge Aries and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K-cars </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the year and fill 1989 orders by increasing production at a Mexican plant. On Thursday and Friday, local union leaders received detailed reports of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s initial contract proposals, which veered sharply from a job-protecting industry-pattern pact established last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The contract, which covers 66,000 active and laid-off workers in 15 states and 65,000 retirees, expires Sept. 14. The two sides agreed to early talks to prevent further deterioration in their damaged relationship. Workers already angered by the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> decision threatened to cripple <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> with plant-by-plant strikes and general non-cooperation when it attempted to sell its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> backed off from the sale and asked for early talks in March.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed After GNP Data; Gold Also Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished mixed Tuesday after reacting mildly to fresh economic data from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Gold prices rose after falling in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 449 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared with $ 447.50 late Monday. Traders said the dollar weakened `` insignificantly'' after the government reported that the gross national product rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said consumer spending, the biggest surge in business investment in more than four years and growing exports kept the gross national product rising. Although the figure was down from the 4.8 percent growth reported during the previous quarter, it was in line with market expectations. `` There was minimal activity after the GNP report,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Activity picked up somewhat later in the session on technical factors. Much of the day's activity centered on the buying of dollars against the Japanese yen. But <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects the dollar's rise against the yen in domestic trading to be `` more than offset by selling in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'' what currency markets open for trading. `` Exporters and other Japanese companies are happy with anything at 125 yen -LRB- to the dollar -RRB- or higher,'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.43 yen to a closing 124.57 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 124.70 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar finished at 125.15 yen, up from 124.735 yen. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the dollar ended slightly lower after trading in a narrow range. A dealer in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> noted that `` the GNP figure has n't given us a clear incentive to do anything new with the dollar. But late in the session the dollar staged a partial recovery in reaction to reports that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> might break diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The British pound rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.8760, from $ 1.8730 on Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.8744 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $ 1.87355. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.67235 West German marks, down from 1.67525; 1.38725 Swiss francs, down from 1.38735; 5.6945 French francs, up from 5.68625; 1,246.50 Italian lire, up from 1,244.75, and 1.2286 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23175. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday: 1.6747 West German marks, down from 1.6765; 1.3860 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6875 French francs, down from 5.6915; 1.8765 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8790; 1,244.00 Italian lire, down from 1,245.00, and 1.2289 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2309. Gold prices were mixed. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold rose to close at $ 449.80 a troy ounce, from Monday's $ 448.90. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> gold fell to a late bid price of $ 447.50 a troy ounce, from late Monday's $ 449.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 448, compared with $ 450 late Monday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.19 to close at a bid $ 449.94. Silver bullion prices also varied. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver rose to $ 6.381 a troy ounce, from Monday's $ 6.355. But in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.36 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $ 6.42.

 <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its fiscal third quarter profit jumped 40 percent over a year ago, boosted by a lower federal tax rate.

<DATELINE>COLON FREE ZONE, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Colon Free Zone, normally one of the world's busiest trading centers, is unusually quiet these days. Huge container trucks stand unused in the zone's narrow streets, empty cardboard boxes are piled on the sidewalks and workers sit idle, waiting for something to do. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political and economic crisis has dealt a severe blow to the Colon Free Zone, considered the second largest in the world after <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Since the deepening of the nation's woes in late February, trade has slowed dramatically, small firms have shut their doors, and employees have been placed on unpaid leave. `` The situation could n't be worse,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Users </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents businesses here. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizrachi </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Mizratex </LOCATION>, said, `` We've never seen a situation like this, ever.'' And a truck driver, who refused to give his name for fear of reprisals, said, `` There's nothing to do.'' He's had little work in nearly two months, he said. There are few buyers purchasing goods that need to be hauled outside the zone. The total value of trade in the center was $ 205.4 million in March, a 36.1 percent drop from March 1987, according to the zone's administrative office Broken down, the figures show that the value of goods imported to the zone plunged 54.9 percent last month. Exports were off 17.4 percent. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> expects an even worse trade picture this month. He projects a decline of 50 percent or more in the total value of commerce. `` The current situation puts in imminent danger the existence of the firms and the 8,000 permanent -LRB- jobs -RRB- of Panamanians who work in -LRB- the zone -RRB-,'' the users association said recently. The contraction comes after businesses rang up $ 4.33 billion in trade in all of last year, the highest since the 94-acre center was created in 1948. Before the crisis virtually paralyzed the nation's economy, government officials had been projecting another banner year in 1988. Latin American countries, the zone's target group, have shaken off some of their economic woes and been more flush with cash in recent years. Located in the city of Colon at the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> entrance to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, the free zone acts as a channel for trade. Such consumer goods as televisions, jewelry, cosmetics, clothing, liquor and pharmaceuticals flow into the zone from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Once in the zone, the products are stored, repackaged, taken apart or put together and sent on to buyers mostly in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. If bound for other countries, goods are free of duties, assessments and fees. Profits are taxed at low rates. More than 700 companies have set up shop in the zone and hundreds more are represented here. But with the nation's latest troubles, businessmen say some small firms have already packed up and left. `` If you take a walk, you can see a lot of places that say, ` For Rent'' or ` For Sale,''' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` Two months ago, you could n't get 50 meters of space in here to rent out.'' He is worried that, `` Those that go are not going to come back and it's going to be very difficult to get new business.'' The key problem for the zone was the government's March 3 closure of the nation's international banking center. The banks suffered a cash squeeze aggravated by the freezing of official Panamanian deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. The shortage prevented the government from providing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s dozen locally owned and operated banks with enough money to cover a run on deposits that began Feb. 26, when military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, ousted the president, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Since then, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has imposed sweeping sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force the removal of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. `` The closing of the banks has been the most damaging single effect on the free zone,'' said <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON>, general manager of the firm <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledano </PERSON>. The trade center is highly dependent on credit. Money is lent to firms in the zone to buy imports and to Latin American buyers who then purchase those goods for re-export. `` Ninety-five percent of the business in the free zone -LRB- involves -RRB- banking,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` We do it through banks. We do n't use cash at all.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the government's bank regulatory agency, has recently permitted the nation's approximately 120 banks to resume limited operations Late Monday, the commission announced the banks could resume, with certain restrictions, handling letters of credit, an instrument widely used in the free zone to guarantee payment. Businessmen doubted the step would have much impact on their trade because of the restricted service and uncertainty about the nation's future.

 The stock market posted some modest gains Tuesday, bouncing back in the final hour of trading after the morning's strong advance faded in the early afternoon. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points on Monday and nearly 17 points in the morning, finished with an 8.79-point gain to close at 2,044.76. It was the fourth consecutive gain in the market's best-known indicator. Monday's close was revised to 2,035.97. Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 926 up, 551 down and 491 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 152.30 million shares compared with 156.95 million shares on Monday. Before trading started, the government reported that the the economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1988. The first-quarter expansion in the gross national product, which followed a 4.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 1987, had been widely anticipated. Nonetheless, analysts said the market took some encouragement from the fact that the economy had neither bogged down as some had feared after last October's crash nor accelerated in a fashion that might force the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to restrain it by encouraging higher rates of interest. `` What Wall Street needs is moderation, not a boom or a bust but an economy that is just chugging along,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, a market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The GNP numbers were just that _ chugging along.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, a technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market welcomed the slower rate of growth because `` the feeling is no one will be toying with money rates because the economy was overheating.'' Some recent reports of strong first-quarter earnings were also cited as helping stock prices. But other analysts noted the relatively slow pace of trading, and worried that gains recorded in such an environment could easily be wiped out at the first suggestion of more negative economic developments. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagle </PERSON>, director of technical analysis for <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the afternoon price pullback followed rumors that non-OPEC members were close to an agreement with members of the cartel on oil production cutbacks that would help keep prices up Within an hour, the Dow Jones industrials retreated from being up 16.25 points to being down about three points. The widely-watched average recovered in the last hour of trading, however. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was the most actively-traded stock on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, and it rose -RRB- to 48 ~ after reporting sharply higher earnings Elsewhere in the oil group, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 49, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 45, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> was up ~ at 75 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> rose ~ to 79. Among other widely-held issues, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 26 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> fell \ to 40 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 114 \ and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 to 76 Lucky Stores rose 1 -RRB- to 55 -RRB-. The company has been fighting a takeover bid of $ 45 a share from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and said it has received other takeover proposals. But <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 to 23 -LRB- after announcing it called off a leveraged buyout. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 13.7 billion, or 0.53 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 177.78 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index rose 0.72 to 148.93. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.68 to 307.51, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.47 to 263.93. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index rose 2.50 to 301.45. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market closed at 377.84, up 2.57.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday charged an investment group headed by British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> violated court orders by attempting to acquire shares in his $ 1.7 billion hostile takeover bid. Two courts have barred <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formed by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, from buying more shares in its $ 60-per-share bid for the Pittsburgh-based cement company. BNS said that as of last Friday, 13.9 million of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' common shares, or 53.4 percent, had been tendered. If BNS were able to consummate its offer, those shares, plus the 2.1 million BNS already holds, would give the group 56.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' stock. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to order BNS to testify whether court orders involving stock purchases have been violated. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said BNS has taken a series of actions that `` are not only contemptuous but a fraud on the market'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said the company had no immediate comment. Separately, a federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> also has prohibited BNS from attempting to acquire a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' common stock on the grounds that the takeover might violate antitrust laws The order will stand at least until May 13, when the court is scheduled to hear the BNS appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> also asked the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> court to order BNS to extend its bid indefinitely. The offer, which has been extended weekly, is set to expire at midnight Friday, unless extended again. Some analysts said the number of shares tendered, combined with apparent lack of progress by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' board in developing a competing plan, could force <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate with BNS. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Drahuschak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> might have to reconsider its opposition to the bid if the shares tendered reach 65 percent to 70 percent by the end of the week. Without approval from <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' board, BNS would have to get 85 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' shares for its bid to be successful under provisions of the anti-takeover law in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Skyrocket On Set-Aside Acreage Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices soared in late trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, gaining as much as 18 -LCB- cents a bushel on indications that fewer acres will be available for soybean production. Grain futures also advanced. On other markets, energy and precious metals futures increased; livestock and meat were mostly higher; and stock-index futures rose. The late soybean rally followed comments made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> expects about 9 million acres to be put into its optional program for wheat and feed grains, analysts said. The price-support program pays farmers 92 percent of their normal deficiency payments regardless of how little acreage they plant. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Klopfenstein </PERSON>, a deputy administrator in the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said farmers signing up for the program were expected to take 3.5 million acres out of corn production instead of the 1.5 million acres the market had anticpated, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That acreage could not be used for soybean production, which adds new tension to a market already stressed by fears of tight supplies `` That was the catalyst,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Analyst <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> of Chicago-based G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the message was clear: `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials indicated there could be less acreage of both corn and soybeans this spring,'' he said. Speculation that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> might be offered 50,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil under a subsidized export program added further fuel to the soybean rally, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Meanwhile the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced that corn planting was under way with about 15 percent of the crop planted through Sunday. That compares with 11 percent on the same date last year and normal progress of 9 percent for that date. Wheat settled -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.12 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.00 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 1.65 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 16 cents to 18 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.77 -LCB- a bushel. Gold futures ended a five-day decline, settling slighly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Silver also advanced. `` The gold market did n't seem to know quite what it wanted to do today,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziemian </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Right now it's just kind of very quiet, trying to look for something to make it move in one direction or the other.'' Gold settled 90 cents to $ 1.10 higher with June at $ 451.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2 cents higher with May at $ 6.385 a troy ounce. Oil prices moved moderately higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders nervously watched the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meetings that got under way in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and rival producers met to discuss ways of reducing production to boost prices. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 21 cents higher with June at $ 18.60 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent to .83 cent higher with May at 52.04 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .26 cent to .41 cent higher with May at 52.42 cents a gallon. Most cattle futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to higher cash prices and strong demand by beef packers, analysts said. Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .23 cent higher with June at 70.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .57 cent higher with April at 80.20 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent lower to .40 cent higher with June at 48.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .48 cent lower with May at 51.62 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .95 point higher at 264.80.

<HEAD>Recording Business Reports Banner Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s burgeoning love affair with the compact disk propelled the music business to a banner year in 1987, with sales of records, cassette tapes and compact disks totaling $ 5.57 billion. That figure _ based on suggested retail price, a somewhat inflated estimate _ was up 20 percent from $ 4.65 billion in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The total number of disks sold also rose, in contrast to 1986 when sales of the high-priced disks pushed the dollar value up while unit sales declined, the association said. The total number of records, tapes and disks shipped rose 14 percent to 706.8 million last year, but that failed to top the all-time high unit sales of 726.2 million in 1978. Sales of compact disks, the high-quality, laser-read recordings now favored by audiophiles, soared 93 percent in 1987, to 102 million disks worth an estimated $ 1.6 billion. The number of cassette tapes sold rose 19 percent to 410 million tapes for an estimated $ 2.9 billion. Sales of record albums and extended play records dropped 15 percent to 107 million records, for an estimated $ 793 million. Singles sales were down 13 percent to 82 million units, or $ 228 million. A new format, the cassette `` single,'' which contains just one or two songs, accounted for 5 million units, or $ 14.3 million.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which three weeks ago rejected a $ 1.74 billion takeover bid that would have created the nation's largest supermarket chain, said Tuesday it has received other takeover proposals. Lucky, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s second-biggest grocery chain, said it was reviewing the new bids as well as other possibilities that would benefit shareholders more than <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s pending tender offer of $ 45 a share. A spokeswoman for Lucky declined to elaborate on the brief formal statement. The company's soaring stock, which was trading at $ 32 a share a month ago before <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> announced its offer, closed up another $ 1.37 -LCB- to $ 55.37 -LCB- Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In a separate development, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> _ which has extended the deadline on its offer to Saturday _ suggested to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that Lucky hold an auction among interested parties. Industry analysts said they had only vague ideas as to the identity of Lucky's new suitors but said the company would be an attractive acquisition. `` It's -LRB- one of -RRB- the largest in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with a very strong identity of being the low-price leader and it has a meaningful position in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. And it's a well-run company,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Olmstead </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Lucky, based in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, employs 39,000 people and has 480 outlets. With 340 stores in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, it is smaller only than Safeway among supermarket chains based in the state. In March, <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 1.74 billion to acquire Lucky's 38.6 million outstanding shares. The bid came just 17 months after Lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, a grocery and drugstore chain, has 1,700 outlets in 40 states. A merger with Lucky would create the nation's largest supermarket chain, surpassing <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> But Lucky turned the offer down and also rejected <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' proposal to raise the bid to $ 50 a share, or $ 1.93 billion, in a negotiated acquisition. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors said its financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, considered both offers inadequate. The Lucky board also authorized the company's management to consider other ways to ncrease shareholder value, including a possible reorganization of the company to focus on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a leveraged recapitalization with a possible special payment to shareholders, and a negotiated sale of the company. Lucky Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON> had asked interested parties to submit bids by Monday. `` Just knowing management, I think they would just like to remain independent,'' <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> said. `` They are under the gun to enhance shareholders' value, maybe through a leveraged buyout or having someone acquire them that is not a supermarket retail company and who would let the existing management team run the company,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poloroid Reports Drop In Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that its first quarter profit slipped nearly 50 percent from a year ago despite a moderate rise in worldwide sales. The company blamed part of the poor performance on higher tax rates and a sharp increase in expenditures linked to the planned introduction of a new instant camera line next month. For the first three months of the year, net income totaled $ 12.8 million, or 21 cents a share, on sales of $ 410.1 million. That compared with earnings of $ 24.6 million, or 40 cents a share, and sales of $ 381.1 million in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said profits from operations fell to $ 26.2 million for the period from $ 30.1 million during the first quarter last year. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON> said expenditures associated with the introduction of the Impulse instant camera hurt earnings. <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON> said some of the first quarter costs involved marketing geared toward clearing inventory of existing cameras and promotion of the two Impluse cameras, scheduled to be introduced in stores nationwide on May 9. <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON> said other expenditures included research and development. The cameras, unveiled to the media in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> earlier this month, are listed to sell at $ 89 and $ 69. The company also noted foreign currency exchange losses and a 30 percent increase in worldwide tax payments compared with the first quarter of 1987 contributed to the profit and earnings decline.

<HEAD>GE Shareholders To Vote On Abortion Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stockholder is asking the company's shareholders to vote on `` refraining from support of any organizations that counsel or perform abortion.'' The company, whose annual meeting is Wednesday in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, says in its proxy statement that it recommends a vote against the proposal. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, said the company `` does n't knowingly support any organization that is pro- or anti-abortion. The proposal is being offered in the name of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Leschin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marshalltown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, but he referred questions to his wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, who said she had `` nothing to say other than what is worded in the resolution.'' The proposal said the `` the cumulative demographic facts of abortion on demand ... have now begun to impact on the American society.'' It said abortion's consequences include `` the closing of schools due to an absence of children, the ongoing expansion of nursing care facilities of the elderly, and the future lack of younger workers to sustain the Social Security system and the defense of our nation.'' In the proxy statement, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said its `` board opposes this proposal because the company does not adopt positions unrelated to business interests ... the company has adopted no position on the abortion issue.'' When asked if the company offers charitable contributions to groups on either side of the abortion issue, <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> said, `` Not that we know of.'' <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynolds </PERSON>, a senior vice president of the public relations firm <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knowlton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the anti-abortion proposal reflects `` the basic phenomenon where people like to use the proxy machinery to express an opinion on something.'' `` This woman has an anti-abortion point of view, apparently,'' he said. <PERSON> Raynolds </PERSON>, who said he has supervised studies of company annual reports, said `` there are all kinds of things'' showing up on proxy statements ranging from experimental tests with animals to protesting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> holdings. Shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, defeated a resolution on Monday that would have prohibited company benefit payments for abortions and related services and required management to disclose to shareholders any information about research and testing on animals. `` Nothing really surprises me in a proxy statement anymore,'' <PERSON> Raynolds </PERSON> said. `` This is a trend documented in lots of places where institutions used to sell stock if they did n't like management, but now they want to own stock and stay in, but get their point of across.''

<HEAD>First RepublicBank Reports $1.5 Billion Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ailing <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, confirming an earlier announcement, reported Tuesday a $ 1.5 billion loss for the first quarter of 1988 and attributed much of it to heavy real estate loan losses. The amount is the sixth-largest quarterly loss by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporation and is triple the amount of corporate projections. A preliminary announcement of the earnings loss on April 12 followed a $ 1 billion emergency loan extended by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to the Dallas-based holding company on March 19. In 1987, bank officials reported a loss of $ 656 million. Company officials said the first quarter loss primarily is the result of a $ 1.4 billion loan loss in its real estate loan portfolio and $ 126 million of losses and write-downs of assets. Earlier this month, Comptroller of the Currency <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> to begin restructuring and change its leadership. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON>, former chairman and chief executive officer, resigned April 12, when the huge loss was first indicated. He was the second top executive to leave the firm during the management shake-up arranged by federal regulators. Other top officials followed Fronterhouse's departure. Fronterhouse was replaced by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, 68, former chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` The actions taken in the first quarter are consistent with our intention that the company move ahead with its plan to restructure and to recapitalize operations,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said in a statement Monday. First RepublicBank, the nation's 13th largest bank holding company, included $ 235 million in its loan-loss provision for Third World countries, increasing the provision to $ 612 million or 50 percent of the bank's $ 1.2 billion of outstanding debt to these countries. The total loan loss provision exceeded what the company already had written off in loan losses by $ 1.1 billion. The bank reported total non-performing assets increased from $ 543 million in the fourth quarter of 1987 to $ 4.5 billion in the first quarter of 1988 ending March 31. Eighty-five percent of the non-performing assets increase was attributed to real estate-related assets, the bank said.

 An <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil minister, reacting to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of the cartel's talks with non-OPEC nations, said Tuesday that closer ties among oil producers was in the interest of all countries. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is not against anybody,'' said <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisanti </PERSON>, the oil minister of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is making efforts to stabilize the oil market, and this stability is in the interests of everybody, including consumers,'' he said, adding that this was true `` even in the case of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> made the unprompted remarks as he entered an evening meeting of oil officials from six <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and representatives of seven non-OPEC oil exporters, including <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The two groups were exploring means of cooperation, including possible joint cuts or restraints on oil production. Their aim is to push prices up to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target of $ 18 a barrel. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, speaking during a recent tour of independent oil-producing nations, criticized <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> for seeking to collaborate with other countries. He said the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks were `` doomed to failure.'' `` I ca n't really understand why Secretary <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> made such aggressive attacks against <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. The minister said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s sole intention was to `` reach a rational level in the price of oil.'' `` I do n't believe this is against the national interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the country with the highest cost of -LRB- oil -RRB- production.''

 <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported first quarter profit after suffering a loss a year ago due to a lengthy strike, while <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings more than tripled and <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted a profit after a loss a year earlier. Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> posted first quarter net income of $ 157 million, or 52 cents per share, on sales of $ 4 billion. That compared with a loss of $ 72 million, or 36 cents per share, and $ 2.8 billion in sales in 1987. Financial results in the first quarter of 1987 were negatively affected by the 184-day steel strike settled Jan. 31, 1987, and the subsequent start-up costs, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Wheeling-Pitt </PERSON>, which is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy protection, posted a pfofit of $ 46.6 million, or $ 8.68 per share, compared with a loss of $ 115.7 million in its first quarter of 1987. Sales rose to $ 263 million from $ 255 million in the year-earlier period. The 1987 net loss stemmed largely from a change in the company's accounting methods, <PERSON> Wheeling-Pitt </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> said it netted $ 85.4 million, or $ 1.13 a share, compared with earnings of $ 25.6 million, or 38 cents a share, a year ago. Sales jumped to $ 1.33 billion from $ 1.13 billion. The <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Pa.-based company said steel shipments during the first quarter totaled 2.7 million tons, up from 2.3 million tons last year and the highest since the third quarter of 1981. The company also noted that steel prices were up in the first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> said its basic steel operations had a profit of $ 98.1 million for the period, compared to $ 49.2 million a year ago. It reported profits at its mills at Sparrows Point and <LOCATION> Burns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and at <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> said its steel unit, the nation's largest steelmaker, earned $ 167 million on sales of $ 1.4 billion, compared with an operating loss of $ 180 million on sales of $ 190 million in the same quarter of 1987. `` The impressive results in steel are due to reduced costs, strong demand and modestly higher prices,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>. `` We're finally putting to rest the image of a rust-belt industry and replacing it with an image of a highly productive, lean and profitable worldwide competitor.'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said the company expects further profit improvement in the second quarter and a continued strong financial performance for the remainder of the year. `` We see no letup in demand nor softening of prices for steel products,'' he said. `` We are, likewise, optimistic that results in our energy segment will improve as crude oil prices stabilize and refining and marketing margins improve.'' The company said its energy segment netted $ 91 million on sales of $ 2.4 billion in the first quarter. This compares with operating income of $ 121 million on sales of $ 2.3 billion in the first quarter of 1987. Marathon Oil reported first quarter earnings of $ 84 million on sales of $ 2.1 billion, compared with $ 115 million on sales of $ 2.1 billion a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported income of $ 7 million on sales of $ 276 million in the first quarter, compared with $ 6 million on sales of $ 249 million in the first quarter a year ago, the company said. The diversified businesses segment reported income of $ 97 million on sales of $ 322 million in the first quarter, compared with $ 8 million on sales of $ 324 million a year ago. The current quarter's results included a favorable $ 43 million partial adjustment of the restructuring provision taken in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Wheeling-Pitt </PERSON> said an 8 percent increase in product prices resulted in a 3 percent increase in net sales for the 1988 quarter, up to $ 262.9 million on shipments of 548,094 tons of steel products. The company reported that operating costs and raw steel production both dropped 1 percent.

<HEAD>CNW Buyout Called Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm have canceled a planned $ 578 million leveraged buyout of the Chicago-based transportation and manufacturing company because of legal questions, the company announced Tuesday. The investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> senior management group had offered $ 31 a share to acquire the company, in a deal that <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said hinged partly on <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to sell some of its local and regional routes in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. A number of railroad companies, including <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>, are involved in lawsuits with union workers who contend railroads have an obligation to bargain with their employees over the sale of local and regional routes, <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. In February, in light of the unresolved legal issues, <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> extended the closing date for the deal one month to May 31. `` Because of continuing uncertainties concerning labor aspects of regional line sales, the merger could not be consummated prior to the May 31 deadline,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, stated Tuesday. `` The board concluded that an extension of that deadline was not in the best interests of <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. The leveraged buyout deal, approved by <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s board on Nov. 16, consisted of a package of cash and securities valued at $ 31 a share. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 1 to $ 23.12 -LCB- in trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The deal called for <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to own 57.5 percent of the succeeding company's common stock. The senior <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> investment group led by <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> was to hold a 7.2 percent stake, with 35.3 percent held publicly. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> owns the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading freight hauler in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states.
