<HEAD>HUD Audit: Island Park Officials Excluded Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, home village of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, rigged the distribution of federally subsidized homes in the early 1980s to keep out blacks, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in its Thursday editions reported that an audit by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> indicates that one person who received preferential treatment was <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s cousin, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccimarro </PERSON> At the time, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> was supervisor of the Town of <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, of which Island Park is an incorporated subdivision. He was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> shortly after that, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Ciccimarro </PERSON> was selected to buy a $ 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> house, the Times said. Also receiving preferential treatment was <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> McGann </PERSON>, a village board member and a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> administrator whose son received a $ 44,500 house, it said. In the 1980s, <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> got enough money to build 285 houses for lower-income families. Island Park, which is 97 percent white, got enough money to build 44 homes ranging from $ 40,000 to $ 64,000. The audit does not say if the people selected for the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> houses actually were eligible to buy them. Buyers included the niece of the village clerk, the niece of a village trustee, two village supervisors, a lawyer who soon will become a village justice and the daughter of a village employee, the newspaper said. None of them are black. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers so lower-income residents, especially minorities, would have a chance to buy a home. Instead, some selected residents were told in advance when the ads would appear and they slipped their applications under the Village Hall door before dawn, the Times reported. The 1984 audit recommended disciplinary action against Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> and the village but no penalties. Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> last year was promoted to regional <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> administrator after her friend, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, lobbied <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House on her behalf, the newspaper said. When the Times requested a copy of the audit, Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> deleted the names of eight villagers, including her son. `` This program was a mockery,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pless </PERSON>, who did the audit. `` It took everyone's tax money and gave it to the people who did n't need it.''

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier serving <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, announced Wednesday it was adding at least two extra flights to the three scheduled weekly to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s capital, and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it will join the evacuation with charter flights. `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> stands ready to assist Americans who desire safe and efficient transportation out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The first of the additional flights from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Wednesday, said spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>. It was scheduled to to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> could n't say how many of the 400 seats were occupied. United has agreed to provide the planes and crews and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will determine who boards the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. The second charter flight, a round-trip flight between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> only, received approval from both governments late Wednesday and is scheduled to arrive Thursday, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. Two <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> commercial flights which had already made round trips between <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> earlier this week were not fully booked out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he noted. There were 307 passengers on one and 335 on the other, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-100s used on the route can carry more than 400 passengers. Earlier Wednesday, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged all Americans to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after rifle fire broke windows at apartment buildings occupied by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government workers. While the administration noted there had been no direct threats against foreigners, it cited an increasingly chaotic situation. On Tuesday, the government's advice had focused solely on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. United personnel reported no problems at or en route to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> that it would provide a DC-10 for U.S.-chartered shuttle flights between <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, perhaps through the weekend. The aircraft, with a capacity for 284 passengers, will operate two daily shuttle flights on Friday, airline spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. There was no immediate word from <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> about whether it would supplement it twice-weekly flight to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Wednesday restored the injunction prohibiting the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> from selling old-growth timber around northern spotted owl nests in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Acting on an appeal brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and other environmental groups, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> without comment restored the year-old injunction lifted last month by a federal judge. The action was praised by environmentalists, who contend the spotted owl will become extinct unless the ancient forests where it lives and hunts are preserved. The timber industry contends that thousands of jobs will be lost unless logging of old growth timber on federal lands is allowed to continue. The action means as much as 400 million board feet of timber, a third of the agency's annual harvest in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, wo n't be offered for sale, said <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smurthwaite </PERSON>. Five timber sales on the <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> districts which were sold during the course of the legal wrangling were n't included in the injunction. The action was separate from a lawsuit filed by environmentalists against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> that stopped harvest of 1 billion board feet of timber on national forests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In lifting the injunction, Judge <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> failed to consider new information in preparing its managment plans for spotted owls, which the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has proposed for listing as a threatened species.

<HEAD>Brazilian Firms Gets Film Rights of Ecologist's Life Story</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Brazilian film company beat out <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> filmmakers and purchased the rights to film the life story of the assassinated <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> ecologist <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> `` Chico'' <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> JN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmes </ORGANIZATION> signed a $ 1.76 million contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Chico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mendes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to lease the exclusive rights to an English-Portuguese film, TV series, autobiographical book and videocassette on <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>' life, producer <PERSON> Jofre </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> told a news conference The announcement Wednesday ended a two-month contest among international movie companies _ including <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, representing 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> _ for the rights to shoot a movie about the life and death of <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, 44, was the leader of a rubber tappers union who fought to save the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle from deforestation. In December, he became to many the world's first ecological martyr when he was shot to death outside his modest wooden house in the Acre state jungle town of <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>, 2,700 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. Authorities arrested the son of a cattle rancher in the shooting. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> had won a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> award for his struggle against ranchers eager to clear the rain forest for grazing. His death struck a chord worldwide. Hollywood producers rushed to the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> with offers to buy film rights. But a four-member panel from the <ORGANIZATION> Chico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mendes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an organization made up of ecologists, rubber tappers and family members, chose <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> JN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmes </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night. `` We are not trying solely to make money on this project,'' <PERSON> Chico </PERSON>'s widow, Ilzamar, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to get news out throughout the world of who <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> was, what he stood for and the forces who tried to stop him.'' Panel member <PERSON> Gilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pescador </PERSON> said JN was chosen because its offer included making a TV series, a video and a book based on <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>' life <PERSON> Pescador </PERSON> called some of the Hollywood proposals `` illusory,'' but also noted, `` We thought a Brazilian film company would best show the destruction that's going on and the reality of the people of the region.'' He declined to confirm a reported $ 1.2 million offer made this week by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> for rights to the movie alone. The movie script, to be written by Brazilian author <PERSON> Marcio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, will be in English and <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> and foreign distributors will be contacted to help sell the film abroad, <PERSON> Pescador </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilha </PERSON>, the designated director, said filming for the estimated $ 10 million project would begin in May 1990 on location in <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>. Plans also include filming in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pescador </PERSON> said nearly $ 400,000 from the rights would go to family members, with $ 400,000 going to public education and health projects for Indians and rubber tappers throughout the region. He said <PERSON> Ilzamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> would donate the remainder to the rubber tappers union and other such organizations in the state of Acre, he said.

 A teacher was illegally suspended by a school board for refusing to wear a tie in his classroom, a circuit judge ruled Wednesday. The ruling does n't ensure that <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 46, will return to his <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> classroom, but it undermines the <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s main charges in the math teacher's firing `` If they could n't suspend him, they sure as hell could n't fire him,'' the teacher's wife, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, said in a telephone from the couple's <LOCATION> Gallipolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, home. Her husband was en route to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to appear on `` The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' which planned a program Thursday on people fired because of the way they dress. The <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> board suspended <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> three times last fall, accusing him of insubordination for violating a dress code requiring male teachers to wear dress pants and ties. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, whose standard classroom wardrobe consisted of blue jeans and cotton shirts, openly challenged Superintendent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' order, drawing suspensions lasting 4, 11 and 30 days before being fired Dec. 19. Kanawha Circuit Judge <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s ruling set aside the 11-day suspension, meaning <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> will be paid for that time, said the teacher's attorney, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopleman </PERSON>. A hearing on the firing and the 30-day suspension is pending, <PERSON> Kopleman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> did n't challenge the four-day suspension because he was paid. King said the dress code was improperly established and that <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had the right to disobey rules he believed were illegal. `` If you challenge a rule that is in effect unlawful, it's not insubordination,'' said <PERSON> Kopleman </PERSON>. The board claimed <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> should have worn a tie while challenging Chambers' order. `` The superintendent did n't have the authority to unilaterally issue a dress code,'' said <PERSON> Kopleman </PERSON>. `` Only the board has the authority. That was one of our premier arguments.'' Board member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Siders </PERSON>, who introduced a proposal to fine <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, said Wednesday night he was n't aware of King's decision and that the board had not talked about what to do if <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s appeals were successful. Board president <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> could not be reached. Chambers and board attorney <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> have unlisted numbers. The next board meeting is scheduled for June 19. The controversy began in August 1988, when the board said male instructors would have to wear ties, a change from contracts teachers signed last spring. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who has worked for the <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school system for 19 years and is also a farmer, has spent his spare time working around the house and at a body shop he runs. Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said her husband will be wearing denim from top to bottom on the <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> program Thursday. `` I pressed them before he left,'' she said. `` I seldom press them, but this is big time.''

 A national <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official resigned Wednesday in the uproar over a memo he wrote comparing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record with that of a homosexual congressman. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as described as `` disgusted by this entire incident'' and as considering it closed. However, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the resignation of `` one staffer'' was n't good enough and suggested his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, should be fired by the president. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, a press assistant in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential campaign, wrote the memo and had it distributed as communications director of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The memo, which <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said was sent out without his boss <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s knowledge, compared <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record to that of liberal Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. The memo was titled: `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>: Out of the Liberal Closet.'' `` The president was very upset,'' said White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> in an interview reported in Thursday editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was upset. It went too far. It was wrong. The innuendo was wrong. It's wrong not because it damages our relationship with the Democrats. It's wrong because it's wrong. `` It's a terrible thing to happen at this time. It was not appropriate or fair,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who said both he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had rebuked <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, his 1988 campaign manager, Wednesday morning, shortly before the resignation was announced. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had telephoned <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to apologize Tuesday night. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman said, `` He was disgusted by this entire incident.'' `` We consider the matter closed,'' he added. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, likewise, commenting after a previously scheduled meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House, said, `` The issue is closed.'' He said there was no mention of it during the meeting. Earlier at the Capitol, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said that on the telephone <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had been `` deeply apologetic for any inferences of personal character.'' `` He repudiated the statement and apologized ... I accepted that,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> promised there would be no more such attacks. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, in his first full day as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker, said any suggestion that he is homosexual is `` entirely untrue of course.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>'s resignation, `` One staffer ca n't take the fall for an entire <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> political operation that's up to its knees in sewer-style politics. I think it's fair to ask President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he'll also have his hand-picked party chairman, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, to resign. `` The president himself has to be accountable for the activities of his henchman,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders also decried the memo and the strategy it seemed to represent. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, `` I would guess this is a rather deliberate effort on the part of some to smear <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> ... on his first day as speaker. ... I would say this is not politics. This is garbage. We're disgusted by it.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> declared, `` To those who have now departed the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, I say, ` Good riddance!''' House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., expressed dismay over the memo Tuesday and called both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, aides said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, at the White House for the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, told reporters, `` It was a mistake obviously from the national committee's point of view.'' He said he did not know if <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> had been asked to resign but said he had told <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, `` There's got to be some remedy for what took place, and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, it's your shot. Do whatever you think is appropriate.'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said in his resignation letter to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, `` At no time did I ever intend to damage anyone's reputation. Nonetheless, the purpose of the memorandum has been misconstrued. And in that regard, I have no one to blame but myself.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the second-ranking <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrat, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needed to take more responsibility. `` They're playing good cop, bad cop,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said before the resignation was announced. `` Here's a guy sent in by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to do the dirty deeds, and he calls and apologizes after the fact. If they're really upset about these tactics, all they have to do is fire somebody. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think we're going to be moving rather strongly to make sure it stops.

The woman's parents `` are prominent Islamics residing in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'' who apparently believe it appropriate to pay someone to kill 18-year-old <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, lawyer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplis </PERSON> said in a court document released Wednesday. <PERSON> Caplis </PERSON> told District Attorney <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> that he compared <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s plight to that of author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> _ who was sentenced to death by the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> for writing `` The Satanic Verses.'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to complain through diplomatic channels. `` There's very little that agencies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can do,'' said Assistant Boulder District Attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>. `` It's very difficult for any law enforcement agency to do anything other than keep a closer eye on Mr <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has gone into hiding, moving three times in the past month, <PERSON> Caplis </PERSON> said. `` He's terrified, basically, out of his mind. He just firmly believes that they will try to kill him,'' the lawyer said. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was accused of raping the woman in her dormitory room last October. He claimed she consented to have sex with him. Prosecutors dismissed the case without filing charges. The woman returned to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> earlier this year. When <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he would sue the woman unless she apologized publicly, she beat him to the punch with a lawsuit of her own. <PERSON> Caplis </PERSON> first got wind of a possible threat against his client's life while taking a deposition for the civil case from one of the woman's friends A second friend confirmed the story, <PERSON> Caplis </PERSON> said. The alleged murder plot came to light after <PERSON> Caplis </PERSON> petitioned a <ORGANIZATION> Boulder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge to lift a gag order in the case. He argued that the public spotlight might help protect <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>.

 Convicted `` Onion Field'' killer <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was sentenced to a 90-day jail term on a drug charge Wednesday, but prosecutors dropped assault and attempted rape charges for lack of evidence, officials said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 58, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of being under the influence of a banned narcotic substance, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuedgen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Citris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> clerk. Police said the drug was heroin. Commissioner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to a 90-day term, to be served concurrent with any other terms stemming from a possible parole violation, Ms. <PERSON> Stuedgen </PERSON> said. Prosecutors rejected police charges of suspicion of attempted rape, false imprisonment and heroin possession for lack of evidence, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalvey </PERSON>, a secretary at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION> disrict attorney's office Police arrested <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> late Monday after a 36-year-old woman alleged that he held her captive over the weekend. The woman escaped and called police Monday, officials said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> still could be sent back to state prison because his arrest on Monday violated terms of his parole in the `` Onion Field'' police killing, officials said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> could serve up to a year even without a new conviction, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, deputy regional administrator for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Division. The state Board of Prison Terms can revoke parole upon a finding of `` just cause,'' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s parole agent. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> abducted <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officers <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hettinger </PERSON> in March 1963 and drove them to an onion field south of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and shot at <PERSON> Hettinger </PERSON>, who escaped on foot in the darkness. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> were twice sentenced to death for the killing. The sentences were overturned. The crime and ensuing trial were recounted in <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON>'s best-selling 1973 novel, `` The Onion Field,'' which was made into a movie <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is serving a life term. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was paroled in February 1982 after serving 19 years at Soledad Correctional Facility. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was ordered back to prison in 1982 for six months after failing a drug test and neglecting to tell his parole officer he was leaving the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. In July 1984, he was convicted of selling heroin while on parole and sentenced to five years. He was paroled in November 1986. His parole was revoked twice after that. <PERSON> Hettinger </PERSON>, now a supervisor on the <ORGANIZATION> Kern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s death sentence should have stood. `` Both of them should have been executed,'' he said. `` This is typical of a continuing pattern of violence from <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.

 Scientists said today they have discovered two highly unusual substances in old soils, supporting the idea that an ancient comet or asteroid struck the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and maybe killed off the dinosaurs. Two amino acids that are very rare on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> but abundant in some meteorites appear in sediments that formed around 65 million years ago, the time of a mass extinction involving organisms from dinosaurs to marine plankton. The finding is `` a very compelling piece of evidence'' that an extraterrestrial object struck the Earth around that time, said study co-author <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bada </PERSON>. But in a recent telephone interview, he said he took no stand on whether the impact caused the extinction. <PERSON> Bada </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meixun </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, present their work in today's issue of the British journal Nature. An editorial accompanying the report called the findings intriguing but cited `` troubling'' questions about the researchers' interpretation The work follows on a hypothesis proposed in 1980, that mass extinction occurred some 65 million years ago because a mountain-sized object struck the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, kicking up large quantities of dust and igniting huge fires. The dust and smoke blocked the sun's rays, and many species froze or starved as their food supply disappeared, the hypothesis suggests. Supporters of the idea note that sediments that formed at the time of the mass extinction contain unusually high concentrations of iridium, a substance rare in the Earth's crust but found in meteorites. Skeptics counter that the iridium may have been produced by extensive volcanic activity. The new study found amino acids called alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and racemic isovaline in sediments that lie close to the main iridium-bearing layer in <LOCATION> Stevns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Klint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. These amino acids are extremely rare on Earth and not likely to come from volcanoes, the reseachers said. In addition, the ratio of the amounts of the two substances was comparable to that previously measured in a meteorite. Surprisingly, the substances were not found in the same layer as the bulk of the iridium, but only in nearby strata, the researchers said. Perhaps the amino acids leaked away from the iridium-bearing clay, they said. But that does not explain how the amino acids could vacate the clay completely, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> of the chemistry department at <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> wrote in the editorial. The researchers also said they found greater amounts of the amino acids than one would expect to survive from the impact of a meteoritelike body. They suggested that the celestial body may have carried unusually high amounts of the substances, at least in comparison to its iridium content. A comet might have done that, they said. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, said no celestial object has been found to meet that requirement. Too little is known about comets to know whether they could be the explanation, he said. To follow up on the new findings, scientists could study different locales and search 65-million-year-old sediments for other amino acids that occur in meteorites but apparently not on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, he said. More than 50 amino acids with no known terrestrial source have been found in meteorites, he said.

 Count <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Pol </PERSON>, losing his last battle with officialdom, has been banished from his ancestral chateau, which is being turned into a local attraction replete with golf course. `` I wanted so much to die at La Perriere,'' the penniless 73-year-old count was quoted by the French news agency Agence France-Presse as saying. The count was expelled Monday from the crumbling edifice where his ancestors lived for 300 years in this town 255 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. For temporary housing, a monks' abbey lent him a farmhouse with neither electricity nor running water. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Pol </PERSON> was given an indemnity of $ 300,000 in lieu of the chateau _ money which he has not yet touched. The bearded count, without financial means, has been fighting since 1981 to keep his chateau, a dilapidated but historic monument which the municipality wanted to restore.

<HEAD>Doesn't Want to Be a `Czar,' But Pledges to Push Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> says he has no appetite for becoming an all-powerful `` czar speaker'' but wants to use his new power as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to bolster the nation's education system and arrest the growth of an underclass in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. At the same time, he concedes that under predecessor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> the Democrats sometimes used their majority status to muscle aside the Republicans. He vows that wo n't happen under a Speaker <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. And he says he has given no thought to his new situation as second in the line of succession to the presidency _ even though his mother `` is enjoying that fact.'' `` But the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has never succeeded to the presidency and we all pray that the president has a healthy and long and successful administration at least for the next 3 -LCB- years,'' he said, adding that any American who does not wish President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> well `` is no friend of the republic.'' Relaxed, sipping a diet cola and back from reminiscing during a 90-minute Oval Office lunch with onetime freshman congressman <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> demonstrated in an interview Wednesday the style that propelled him into the speakership with the good will of many Republicans. `` The days of the czar speakers have long been over,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, recalling the tale that 19th century speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, when asked by a constituent for a copy of the rules that govern the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, `` sent by return mail an autographed photograph of himself.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> rejected the view that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is `` a moral swamp,'' but said some politicians come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> out of a love for political warfare and their every act is aimed at the next election while others come to govern. He put himself among the latter and, ticking off the issues that are dear to his heart, listed education high. `` I'm worried about the growth of the so-called underclass,'' he said, `` millions of young adults and children who are not, for one reason or another, performing in school, or looking forward to an ability to compete in the job market.'' He noted that South Korean children have pulled ahead of Japanese children and far ahead of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> kids in educational achievements. He said Korean youngsters go to school for 240 days a year and carry two lunches _ one for noon, one for late in the day _ because their school day is so long. By contrast, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children typically attend school only 180 days. `` I think the quality of elementary and secondary education is going to determine more our ability to successfully compete in an international economy than probably anything else,'' he said. He said he worries about the `` enormous strains'' imposed on middle-class families, especially those with a few children in college at the same time. He has no agenda of legislation to shove through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but he cited civil rights and civil liberties as important to him, along with education and the enactment this year of congressional ethics legislation. There is no `` <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> plan,'' he said, but one idea worth examining `` might be linking some extinguishment of honoraria with some staged increase in salary'' for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. House members are allowed to keep $ 30,000 a year in fees for giving speeches or writing. Most of the money comes from special-interest groups, and some reform suggestions propose eliminating such honoraria and raising congressional salaries. But <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> suggested he will be in no rush to propose a pay increase in view of the uproar that cause the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to kill a Bush-backed 50 percent raise in January. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> conceded a point to Republicans, saying that under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` I think we've pushed it sometimes to the point where, while we were still within the rules, we were making maximum use of the power of the majority. ... I do n't think we should do that.'' Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said if <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is `` serious about a new beginning,'' he should support a package of rules changes proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> last January. Democrats ignored the proposals under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s leadership, he said. `` There is a new leader and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has a different style,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` systematically excluded the views, opinion, debate, amendments of people who disagreed with the leadership, whether Democrats or Republicans.''

<HEAD>House Vote on FSX Bill Falls Short of Margin to Beat Veto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House opponents of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's planned $ 6 billion FSX fighter deal with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are far short of the votes needed to override an expected presidential veto A measure to restrict the deal passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday but only on a 262-155 vote, far less than the two-thirds margin of 290 needed to override a veto in the 435-member chamber. The administration already has agreed to develop the fighter jointly with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The measure passed Wednesday seeks to stipulate the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating position in future talks on how the FSX, an advanced version of the F-16 jet fighter, actually will be produced. An identical <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution passed 72-27 on May 16. Opponents of the deal say it amounts to a giveaway of critical <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense technology, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says the restrictive legislation would tie its hands in the talks. Before the measure was approved, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, warned that `` in case there's any doubt, the White House will veto this amendment if it is passed.'' The legislation would prohibit transfer to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of critical American jet engine technology and bar <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from selling to third countries the FSX or any of the plane's major subcomponents. It also states that any agreement on coproduction of the FSX should guarantee that at least 40 percent of the work _ including provision of spare parts _ will be handled by American companies. Opponents declared that the legislation, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, D-Ill., might require renegotiation of a memorandum of understanding already reached with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, said the legislation `` could arguably require a renegotiation of the FSX agreement.'' But a leading FSX opponent, Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the restrictions embodied in the measure are needed to `` hold the administration's feet to the fire'' in negotiations Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., said afterward that `` the margin by which both houses passed this legislation sends a message to the president that we are serious about safeguarding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trading rights, protecting American jobs and preserving <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s clear advantage in aerospace technology and production. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who sponsored the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the FSX legislation, said it `` increases the leverage of executive branch negotiators'' in dealing with future coproduction of the `` I sincerely hope the president will not veto improvements in this project, or veto increased leverage for his negotiators,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said following the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. The measure was adopted after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 320-98 to pass a nonbinding sense-of-Congress resolution expressing disapproval of the FSX deal in general, but that vote carries no legal weight. Under the FSX deal, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> is to join with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> in jointly developing and producing the warplane, for deployment by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the late 1990s Most of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> work would be done at its F-16 plant in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. During more than five hours of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor debate Wednesday, opponents contended that the deal amounts to a loss of advanced American technology that will be used by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to help propel its own aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the world market. `` The sale of this technology represents an enormous threat to the health of our domestic aircraft industry,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan. FSX foes also said that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> instead should have purchased `` off the shelf'' American-made F-16s to help offset the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of more than $ 50 billion Supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> said implementing the deal was important to maintaining U.S.-Japan defense ties and would provide about $ 2.5 billion worth of work for American companies. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that he believes the agreement is `` very much in the commercial, political and strategic interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Decision Expected Soon on Oil, Butter Sales to Soviets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decision may be announced soon by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on whether to sell the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> some vegetable oil and butter at cut-rate prices. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been under pressure to add soybean oil to the list of commodities eligible for the Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, so that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> can buy the oil at subsidized prices. Corn oil and butter are also being sought for the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement with the Soviets. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has the proposal under advisement, although there has been some resistance to expand the subsidy program. A consumer advocate, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> in a May 26 letter the soybean industry's proposal for subsidizing oil exports would be `` patently unfair'' for several reasons. Soybeans are in short supply in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a bumper harvest this fall will not change the situation. Food price inflation will remain `` a constant threat to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers until more normal food reserves are in place,'' he said. The global supply of soybean oil also is reported to be tighter than normal, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` Soybean processors argue that domestic soybean oil supplies are slightly at a surplus, a condition they say could be eliminated by the Soviet sale,'' he said. `` However, domestic market conditions appear to be tight enough so that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> would likely need to import 60,000 to 70,000 metric tons of food oil for every 100,000 tons of soybean oil sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> contended that export subsidy programs for farm products `` are of doubtful value, even during periods when domestic supplies are large.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, and others in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> contend that soybean oil should be made available to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, a program set up in 1985 to counter foreign subsidies. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said last month that the Soviets want to buy 200,000 to 500,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil, and urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to approve the sale under the subsidy program. He also asked that corn oil be included. Of immediate concern, <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said, are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s tax laws that allow its processors to undercut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil prices on the world market by more than $ 160 per ton. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a potential market for the equivalent of 1 billion bushels of soybeans a year,'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said. `` We need to move vigorously to develop that market and secure a fair share of it for our soybean industry.'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> noted that current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inventories of soybean oil are at record level of 1.76 million tons and that stocks of corn oil and other vegetable oils also are large.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says there are more jobs waiting for the Class of 1989 at major agricultural colleges than there are graduates to fill them. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday a recent informal survey showed another decrease in the number of agricultural graduates. At the same time, more companies are recruiting on campuses. The telephone survey was done by <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, Ind. Although the number of graduates is down, the survey found an increase in the number of freshmen enrolled in agricultural courses. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goecker </PERSON>, assistant dean of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION>, said the job market has been more competitive and that both employers and students are making earlier commitments. Half of the 1,721 undergraduates in <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION>'s school of agriculture are enrolled in three departments _ agricultural economics, horticulture, and forestry and natural resources. The school expects to graduate 365 seniors this year, up from 355 in 1988, <PERSON> Goecker </PERSON> said. Starting salaries for <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> graduates range from $ 18,000 to $ 30,000 a year, with the average just over $ 20,000, he said. <PERSON> Goecker </PERSON> is a member of a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> committee that has forecast an annual shortage of 4,000 food and agricultural science graduates in the 1990s. Other schools surveyed included: <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>.

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s food inflation may be contributing to much of the bloody turmoil that has centered on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, acting assistant secretary for economics, said the big purchase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat announced on Monday _ a total of 1.85 million metric tons _ helped reflect `` a sensitivity within <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to this issue -LRB- of access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat -RRB- and the need for food.'' <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, in an interview aired today by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> radio, said the big wheat purchase at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market prices _ even when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still qualified for grain under the department's price subsidy program _ was `` some indication of their need for additional grain'' during the current turmoil. `` Internally, they've had substantial increases in food prices,'' <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. `` I have had one Chinese specialist tell me that food prices have gone up 30 to 40 percent in the major cities over the last 18 months.'' <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> speculated that this rise in food prices has helped fan popular support of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> protesters.

<HEAD>New Research Links ``Bottoms Up'' Drinking With Strokes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young adults have been the victims of strokes in recent years after traumatizing one of four main arteries supplying blood to the brain while performing such simple tasks as brushing teeth or tossing back a drink. A 32-year-old woman recently suffered a stroke after playing a drinking game in which she tossed back several shots of whiskey, according to a letter published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. `` It was not only the alcohol but the manner in which she consumed it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON>, a neurology resident at the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and a co-author of the article. Knocking back a shot of whiskey should be included among a list of potential stroke-causing `` trivial traumas,'' including old whiplash injuries, childbirth, heavy lifting and diving into water, <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON> and his colleagues reported. `` We believe that ` bottoms up' drinking, as a form of trivial trauma, caused this young woman's dissection and subsequent stroke,'' wrote <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> co-authors, Drs. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasbani </PERSON>. `` Although alcoholic intoxication has been reported as a risk factor for stroke, the manner in which one chooses to become intoxicated has not.'' <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON> said young adults were particularly prone to damaging the extracranial carotid artery, a major vein through which blood is pumped from the heart to the brain. `` The young are particularly predisposed not only because they more often play drinking games, but also because their arteries are a little more taut than older people's and do not stretch,'' <PERSON> Trosch </PERSON> said in an interview. Known risk factors for dissection of the extracranial carotid artery include fibromuscular dysplasia, hypertension and <PERSON> Erdheim </PERSON>'s cystic medical necrosis The Yale Stroke Program researchers' article suggests many strokes might also have been caused by `` trivial traumas'' that frequently go undetected. `` Patients may consider such movements insignificant and thus not recall them, or be too embarrassed to recount them,'' the authors wrote.

 Net withdrawals from the nation's savings institutions should continue to ease from record high levels as interest rates decline, economists say. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L customers withdrew $ 5.4 billion more than they deposited in April, down from the records set earlier this year but still high in historic terms. Net withdrawals totaled $ 8.3 billion in March, $ 9.2 billion in February and a record $ 10.8 billion in January for a total of $ 33.7 billion so far this year. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, the bank board's chief economist, attributed much of the recent outflow to thrift institutions' failure to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors such as mutual funds. S & amp; L analyst <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L reports will show slower withdrawals or perhaps even a modest gain in deposits in May and June. Interest rates offered by thrifts historically lag behind money market funds both on the way up and on the way down. `` We have reached the most recent peak in interest rates and now of course they are trending down. We're seeing a lessening of the rate-driven shrinkage of deposits,'' <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> also attributed the shrinkage in April to pressure from regulators on overextended thrift institutions to shrink. About half of the decline can be traced to 10 institutions, four of them insolvent, he said. Other analysts, however, say a loss of public confidence in S & amp; Ls has also played a role. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said the April figure is better than it at first appears because withdrawals normally increase in that month because people pay federal taxes. He said outflow was $ 1.6 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis, down sharply from $ 6.7 billion in March and the smallest outflow since last September. Economist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said $ 5.4 billion is `` still not a great number.'' He noted that Americans are saving more this year _ 5.8 percent of their income compared with 4.2 percent last year. `` So, you've got people saving more but still taking money out of thrift institutions. That's not a vote of confidence at all,'' he said.

 If winter wheat farmers are to get any drought relief aid, it may not be decided until the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. During an informal meeting Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said he did n't want to pass legislation that would have to be revised later `` It seems too early to cover spring planted crops,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> during the meeting which attracted 20 other senators. `` We do n't known whether such crops are going to be weather damaged. To act now on spring-planted crops shifts the risk of production almost totally to the federal government _ I do n't think that is a good idea.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was critical of a bill passed last month by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, calling it a `` Christmas tree'' because it promises relief to many crops other than winter wheat, just in case weather later in the year damages them. `` If we do develop legislative response, it ought to be very narrowly defined and circumscribed to the people who have been hurt,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> pointed out that rain has been falling steadily in the past few weeks, even to the point of causing planting delays in some parts of the country. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s committee has not yet acted on any legislation, though a bill authored by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. and one sponsored by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb have been introduced. Those measures would extend assistance provided under the 1988 drought relief act to crops planted in 1988 for harvest in 1989 _ mostly winter wheat. But <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said, `` If you have a winter wheat bill, it becomes the vehicle for the year,'' and he does n't want a measure the country ca n't afford. He said cost estimates for any bill are suspect at this early date, though damage to winter wheat has been estimated to be about $ 1 billion. He said he did n't want to give farmers assistance in a bill that would have to be taken away because of budget restraints. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he did n't see any reason to wait. `` I hope we do n't have to hold the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> hostage until we see if there are problems in other states,'' he said. He said his bill is budget neutral, in that it would use deficiency payments being saved because of higher wheat prices to pay the farmers who are facing losses.

<TEXT>
 Environmentalists say they hope the selection of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON> to the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> will signal a revival for the advisory panel, which was largely ignored in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Wednesday he plans to nominate <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION>, regional administrator in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, to the three-member council and then make him its chairman. The selection of <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> brought praise from several environmental groups. He has gained a reputation as a strong enforcer of environmental laws as the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The council advises the president on environmental matters, but the panel languished with little money, staff or power during the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> largely ignored its members. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON> is a first rate environmentalist and I think he's an outstanding choice,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> `` The bigger question is whether or not the president will give him both the resources and the respect in order to revitalize, rebuild and redirect the <ORGANIZATION> CEQ </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> was `` a very strong environmentalist'' and called his selection `` very much a positive step'' and that he assumed that <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> `` would not have taken the job if he had not had some assurances of what the <ORGANIZATION> CEQ </ORGANIZATION>'s authority would be'' in the White House. The council's influence largely will be `` a question of staffing and money,'' said <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>. In the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration the <ORGANIZATION> CEQ </ORGANIZATION> was provided with professional staff that could research issues and brief council members who, in turn, had strong influence on the president. `` Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration they -LRB- the staff -RRB- vanished,'' said <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had at one time sought to abolish the council. <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION>, who has been mentioned as a possible Republican gubernatorial candidate in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, has been director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> since 1983 where he gained a reputation for aggressively pursuing polluters. He sometimes was at odds with the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters. Earlier this year he was mentioned widely as a top prospect to become head of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was selected instead. During last year's presidential race, <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> added fuel to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's attack on Democratic opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor to clean up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. But while <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for delaying the cleanup, he acknowleged that the federal EPA under the Republican administration also shared blame. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took reporters on a boatride through the polluted harbor, <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> refused to go along. <ORGANIZATION> Deland </ORGANIZATION> 47, whose back problems force him usually to rely on a wheelchair, had occasional clashes with his superiors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years as well as with then-New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, now White House chief of staff. He stood his ground against opposition from <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and blocked the development of a shopping mall in <LOCATION> Attleboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, arguing the complex would destroy environmentally important wetlands. He clashed with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> over a proposed development in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Loon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and endorsed a moratorium on development on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He worked for the president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, on the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal staff and as a private consultant before taking the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> job in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, who rose to prominence in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with his ethics crusades against Democrats, says he wo n't challenge a fellow <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>'s right to vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> while appealing his conviction for having sex with a teen-age girl. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip, said in an interview Wednesday that Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, should not have to give up his right to vote because his conviction involved a misdemeanor, not a felony. He said the conviction for contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor is `` a serious offense, but it's a serious misdemeanor'' which will not cause <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> to lose any citizenship rights. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> faces up to six months in prison and a $ 1,000 fine for his conviction. `` I think the Lukens case will go to the ethics committee and I think the Republican Conference will insist on it,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. `` But I think it is inappropriate for us to impose our judgment on the courts of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'' and bar <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> from voting while his conviction is on appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' chief of staff, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, said the congressman would have no response to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s comments. `` Congressman Lukens is not going to take out time and react to every statement that comes down the pike,'' he said. `` He's taking care of business here on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has insisted since his freshman term in 1980 that any congressman convicted of a felony should not be permitted to vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> while appealing his conviction. He moved to expel then-Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON>, D-Mich., in 1980 after he continued to vote following his fraud conviction, and he threatened similar action against then-Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, after his 1987 conviction for accepting <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> stopped voting after the threat. `` The principle in regard to the felony convictions of <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> was that if you're convicted of a felony, you lose certain of your political rights, including the right to vote,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said his decision not to challenge <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' right to vote was not influenced by his frienship with the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> congressman, who was one of the conservative Republicans who joined with <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> to form the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s. He compared <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' case to that of Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., who along with then-Rep. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, R-Ill., was censured by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 for sexual misconduct with <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> has remained in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and is now chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> predicted that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> eventually will be punished by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and he suggested that a resolution of censure, such as that imposed on <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, might be appropriate. During the 1983 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate over punishment for <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, however, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> argued that they should be expelled from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no high school or college in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where exploiting, seducing or sleeping with students, boy or girl, would be punished with a reprimand,'' he said in the 1983 debate. `` The teacher would be fired. Similarly, the two congressmen, like a teacher, must be fired.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel to Review Medicare's Catastrophic Health Provisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, after narrowly rejecting an attempt to postpone major parts of the new catastrophic health provisions of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, has ordered a committee review of the program. The aim of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> review is to consider reducing the income tax surcharge on the elderly that pays for the new benefits. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., fell two votes short Wednesday evening of attaching an amendment to separate legislation that would have forced a delay of at least one year in the so-called `` supplemental premium'' imposed this year on Medicare-eligible individuals to pay for a package of benefits that start taking effect next January However, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> also would have pushed back those benefits yet another year, and opponents argued that his proposal effectively would have killed major parts of the program approved overwhelming by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer. It is the first major expansion of Medicare since its creation two decades ago. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, seeking to head off the <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> attempt, introduced a substitute amendment that put the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on record as instructing the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to look into reducing the surtax if it is shown that more money is being collected than will be needed. <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, first raised that possibility several weeks ago but the administration, as well as influential <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders, are on record against any tax rollback. In debate on <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s proposal, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also pledged to look closely at ways to exempt from the catastrophic surtax those retired Americans who have equal coverage under `` Medigap'' policies that are paid in full or part by their former employers. And he said he would renew efforts to attach the catastrophic coverage to Part B of Medicare, thus making it voluntary. Part B of Medicare, the section that pays doctor bills, is voluntarily taken by more than 95 percent of those eligible _ in large part because the federal government foots the bill for 75 percent of the costs. Although members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been hit by thousands of letters protesting the new catastrophic program, opponents of the <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> proposal argued that opponents still represent a tiny minority of the 32 million people covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. The idea behind the financing mechanism adopted last year was that _ with huge budget deficits making it impossible to provide new government benefits without additional revenue to pay for them _ it was reasonable to expect that those being offered additional benefits be required to pay for them. Moreover, framers of the program maintained, it was fair for middle - and upper-income retired Americans to pay a proportionately larger share of the cost just as the federal tax system in general is pegged to a percentage of income The catastrophic 15 percent tax surcharge follows that principle, except the maximum imposed on any individual this year is $ 800, regardless of income. Opponents of the <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> attempt argued that an estimated 59 percent of the 32 million Medicare beneficaries do not have enough income to qualify for income tax and would pay only $ 4 a month for the additional coverage. They cited <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 70 percent of those eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> would pay $ 100 or less a year in additional surtaxes and that only 5.6 percent in upper income levels would pay the maximum $ 800 tax. The catastrophic coverage started taking effect Jan. 1 with unlimited hospitalization coverage after a once-a-year $ 560 deductible. However, a $ 1,370 cap on out-of-pocket doctor bills does not kick in until next year and a new prescription drug benefit begins a three-year phase-in period in 1991. It was those benefits beginning next January that <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> wanted to delay, along with the surtax imposed to finance them. Prior to Jan. 1, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> provided full hospital coverage for only 59 days a year. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays 80 percent of physician bills after a $ 75 annual deductible, but until the new catastrophic provisions on doctor fees take effect there is no cap on the patient's share.

<HEAD>House, Senate Face Deep Differences Over Domestic Spending Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> face pressure to resolve their differences speedily over a long-delayed spending bill, but the widest gulf is over one of the hottest political issues: illegal drugs. A bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voiced approval Wednesday for legislation pouring an extra $ 3.3 billion this year into veterans, student loan and other programs. The vote capping lawmakers' fourth day of debate came more than two months after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 2.2 billion version of the bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed its own $ 3.7 billion measure on May 24 on a contentious party-line vote. As is usual with spending legislation, each chamber sprinkled its own bill with provisions boosting individual lawmakers' favorite projects. The biggest difference between the two bills is $ 822 million the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> included for a host of anti-drug programs. Majority Democrats there inserted the money into the bill, over veto threats from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials arguing that the spending would further inflate the deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version contains no drug monies. Despite public opinion polls indicating that illegal drugs is the pre-eminent domestic problem, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> heeded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s warnings and joined Republicans in preventing some legislators from putting drug spending into the bill. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not believe it would be difficult for the two houses to work out their differences over financing new anti-drug efforts. `` I think I can get the White House to compromise on something,'' he told a reporter. But one administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, insisted Wednesday there was still `` no way'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would sign the final bill if any drug spending was included. That was also the conventional wisdom among lawmakers and congressional aides. Legislators will be pressed to bargain quickly by many groups hoping to garner money from the bill, but foremost among them will be the nation's veterans. In each house's measure, there is $ 1.2 billion for health care, compensation increases and other programs for the nation's 27 million veterans. There is no disagreement that the coffers of the Department of Veterans Affairs are running low. The agency has already begun curtailing medical services, purchases of new equipment and other efforts. The two bills also contain money for the Guaranteed Student Loan program, forest fire fighting, foster care, refugee assistance, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping and other initiatives. Before they can send a compromise bill to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature, lawmakers will have to make trade-offs over whose pet projects remain in the measure. There are many. The House bill has provisions directing the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to build a road at <LOCATION> Saylorville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; allowing extra money to be spent on an agriculture research center in <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; and temporarily blocking development of a laser device in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as an anti-satellite weapon. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure provides $ 75 million to replace a broken 300-foot radio telescope in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; supplies $ 7.3 million for the cleanup of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill; and urges the government to buy more apples for the school lunch program. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected 51-49 an effort by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., to amend the bill with a provision delaying much of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s new catastrophic care program for a year Instead, senators agreed to non-binding language promising a future look at altering the program, which imposes a surtax on the elderly that some have complained costs them too much.

 A top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug-control official says efforts to stem the cocaine trade by eradicating crops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will not produce substantial results for years. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON>, the Drug Enforcement Administration's assistant administrator for operations, offered that assessment Wednesday in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narcotics committee. `` Escalating coca cultivation and cocaine production in the Andes has at no time been more critical nor posed as profound a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies,'' <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> said. But while progress is being made in eradication, `` We will not see substantial effects for years against coca,'' he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skol </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is considering `` new directions'' in the eradication effort. He did not spell them out, but suggested they will be expensive. `` Money is a crucial part of the narcotics trade, and unfortunately in this time of tight budgets, money may be one of the most effective weapons we can muster for our anti-narcotics programming,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, he said, must consider `` what happens if and when we are successful'' in eradicating cocaine production: what will happen to the peasant farmers earning their livings growing coca, to the economies of those countries and to the governments that, by wiping out the cocaine business, will be confronted by an angry populace. He said increased economic and military aid will be required. <PERSON> Skol </PERSON> said the governments of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> need additional military assistance because anti-drug officials there are battling both guerrilla groups and well-armed drug traffickers _ who occasionally support each other for either economic or geographic reasons. In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Skol </PERSON> said, the Sendero Luminoso, or `` Shining Path,'' guerrillas have virtually taken control of the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a primary source for the world's supply of coca leaf. When the Peruvian government tries to eradicate the crops there, it winds up fighting the guerrillas as well, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance this year to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is $ 6 million, and the department has requested $ 20 million for next year, <PERSON> Skol </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Was Ready To Send Troops To Panama, Officials Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> denies a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assertion that it was prepared to send military units to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last month in support of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if the President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had attempted to oust the Panamanian leader by force of arms. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity made the assertion Wednesday as the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> was meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A top Nicaraguan official disputed the allegation, saying the Sandinista government provides political and moral support for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but not military aid. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government was ready to act in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s defense as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was weighing options during the tumultuous post-election period in that country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesmen at the time were refusing publicly to rule out any option, including the use of force. In the end, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to send about 2,000 combat troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but said the purpose was not to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but to ensure the safety of Americans residing in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concluded that diplomatic pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was the best course to encourage a democratic outcome in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. According to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> also sent <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a shipment of Soviet-made weapons as part of the Sandinista commitment to help <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> defend his government against possible use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military force. The officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have more than 70,000 personnel under arms, giving them the ability to dispatch troops beyond their borders without sacrificing self-defense. The officials said there appeared to be little doubt that the Sandinistas were prepared to introduce their own combat troops into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if the need arose. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has emerged as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strongest hemispheric ally in the wake of the failed election process in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last month. Both countries see themselves as victims of American military and economic pressures. Asked about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations, Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was concerned about the potential for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but denied that it sent a shipment of weapons. `` We knew there was movement of troops by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> apart from what was announced,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. `` In the face of that situation, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> felt that there was the possibility of an intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This possibility, in turn, created the possibility of a regional conflict and for an intervention in other Central American countries. Based on an emergency situation, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> declared a state of alert for its forces. That's what happened.'' He said that after a few days, when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention did not materialize, the state of alert was withdrawn. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> specifically denied that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> sent arms to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and added that Sandinista authorities have not promised to send troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the event of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> invasion. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s relationship with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is limited to `` moral and political support,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Seeks End to Contractor's Favored Status on Cruise-Missile Engines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, faced with a declining need for cruise-missile engines because of arms-reduction treaties, wants to torpedo a 1978 agreement that requires it to buy 240 of the components annually from a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> company. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s determination to end <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s favored position in supplying the engines has prompted intervention by Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat who for years has criticized the Pentagon for waste and non-competitive procurement practices. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> asserts the agreement with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is illegal under a 1984 law authored by <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> oversight of government management subcommittee. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> on Wednesday accused the Pentagon of trying to break a promise out of convenience rather than a concern for the law. `` I think it is pure expediency, and it is full out unfair,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. The outlines of the agreement were contained in correspondence between <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> made public both by the senator and a Washington-based whistle-blower group, the Project on Military Procurement. The agreement, negotiated because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> wanted a second source of F107 engines for the Tomahawk cruise missile, required <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Walled </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to license its technology to a competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In return, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy at least 240 engines a year from <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up to 1,200 engines annually. The agreement has no expiration date and applies to all government contracts for F107 engines. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> must contract through <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in buying engines from <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has been paid about $ 36,000 for each of the 708 engines built by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>, according to figures provided <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. In a letter to <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> dated April 11, then-Navy Undersecretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the agreement violated <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s amendments to the Armed Services Procurement Act because it required the government to buy the engines under contracts not yet negotiated. `` No contracting officer has the authority to bind the government to award future contracts,'' wrote <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who is now secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. From 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to award the contracts `` without the constraints of -LRB- the agreement -RRB-, on the basis of the best value to the government and the taxpayer,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> wrote. The contract was negotiated by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a consultant and a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer he bribed were given 26-month prison terms June 2 for illegally scheming to help two companies get Pentagon contracts. He and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> were each fined $ 25,000 and ordered to serve two years of supervised probation after their release from prison. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to provide secret <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bid information that would help <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, obtain lucrative contracts to sell electronic equipment to the Pentagon. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> sought comment from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on the agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s press office said Wednesday it was unable to provide information immediately. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s office confirmed the existence of the <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> letter. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> vice president for public relations, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolivette </PERSON>, declined to discuss the issue on the advice of counsel, saying the matter had not yet been resolved.

 An apparent mixup caused a U.S.-chartered flight to evacuate foreigners from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to be denied permission Thursday to fly over Chinese airspace and turn back, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10, which left and returned to <LOCATION> Naha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on the southern Japanese island of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, apparently approached Chinese airspace earlier than agreed upon and was forced to turn back, the official said. `` At 1:20 p.m. -LRB- 12:20 a.m. EDT -RRB- the jet was on the runway preparing to take off again,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Haruki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasuda </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' general manager in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the reason for the refusal for clearance by <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> air controllers was unclear.

 Plans to evacuate Filipinos from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were thrown into confusion today and it took a private radio station to unravel the mess by forcing officials to talk by telephone with harried diplomats in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The sometimes testy conversations, broadcast live by radio <ORGANIZATION> DZMM </ORGANIZATION>, were between a foreign affairs undersecretary, an assistant to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, officials of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and Filipino diplomats in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. For more than a week, Philippine Charge d'Affaires Ariel <PERSON> Abadilla </PERSON> and his deputy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatarata </PERSON>, said there was no need to evacuate some 300 Filipinos in the Chinese capital. But <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> planes were ready at a moment's notice, officials said When the decision to evacuate came, arrangements were not in place. Officials blamed each other. The situation `` is very alarming'' Miss <PERSON> Tatarata </PERSON> told the radio station, and she appealed for PAL to send a plane to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today instead of Friday. Some embassy dependents had to beg for seats aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight because PAL failed to come and fetch them. `` You should not blame the department,'' snapped Foreign Affairs Undersecretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingles </PERSON>, clearly angry over insinuations that his office was not acting urgently enough on messages from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` We are doing our best,'' Ingles said. He then refused to talk further with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatarata </PERSON>, saying he would deal directly only with <PERSON> Abadilla </PERSON>. Ingles then blamed <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which he said was imposing unreasonable conditions. PAL, according to <LOCATION> Ingles </LOCATION>, had scheduled an Airbus-300 to fly to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Friday on condition <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities guarantee there would be enough fuel at the airport and that the aircraft, crew and passengers would be safe. `` PAL is imposing conditions over and above the ordinary obligation of government,'' Ingles said. In the first place, he added, he could not understand why PAL had canceled its regular weekly flights to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. Other national carriers, which had even increased flights to evacuate their nationals, were flying in and out of the Chinese capital without any conditions, he noted. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Ingles </PERSON> said he instructed <PERSON> Abadilla </PERSON> to obtain those guarantees from the Chinese foreign ministry `` but up to now, he has not informed us if these guarantees are forthcoming.'' In a few moments, a panting <PERSON> Abadilla </PERSON> was on the phone. He said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities had provided the necessary guarantees and that he had so reported in a telex sent <PERSON> Ingles </PERSON>' department a half hour earlier. <ORGANIZATION> DZMM </ORGANIZATION> then let <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s legal adviser and spokesman, speak privately to Ingles and Miss Tatarata off the air. In a few minutes, PAL President <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> came on the line and said a plane would leave this afternoon for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Problem solved? Not quite. `` We will need 14 visas for our crew,'' <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Perhaps the playbills at <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> concerts should include a prominent notice in heavy black type, something like `` Warning: Laughing May Be Hazardous To Your Health.'' Sometimes, the Danish-born musician and humorist becomes alarmed when he glances over the footlights and sees his audience doubled up, grimmacing, clenching fists and turning blue with mirth. That ` sng and starts playing a piano interlude to give everyone a He sa he fears inducing heart attacksr good reason. Once, after an uproarious performance in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> returned to the stage in the silence of the empty theater to savor his triumph. Peering out at the seats, he noticed a woman sitting motionless in the 16th row, her eyes closed. She had literally died laughing, he observed ruefully. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> may be a Dane, but melancholy he is not. `` A smile is the shortest distance between two people, and there is always room for a smile,'' the 80-year-old entertainer said in a dressing room interview. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> will be the star attraction at a black-tie gala in his honor tonight at the 6,800-seat <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> atrap Farm Park in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> countryside about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The benefit concert, which will be taped for broadcast on public TV stations, will celebrate both <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>'s 80th birthday last Jan. 3 and the 18th anniversary of Wolf Trap, the only national park for the performing arts. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> promised to repeat some of his most beloved comedy routines, which have delighted millions of people around the world for the past 60 years. The piano lid will slam shut, the revolving stool will never quite reach its correct height, sheet music will fly and soprano <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvey </PERSON> will wait patiently through the pandemonium for her cues. `` I'm,'' he says, `` because I see humor in any situae funeral of his father, a longtime viola player with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, when he coaxed a smile from his grieving mother. The caskes borne by his father's fellow musicians, and it was young <PERSON> Vict </PERSON> who noticed that a short, roly-poly pallbearer wore a silk hatat was much too small, while a tall, skinny musician's hat was arge that it covered his ears. `` I said that if my father could see this now, he would have died laughing,'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> recalls. `` My mother, distraught as she was at that moment, smiled. It was the first time she had smiled since my father died.'' His mother introduced <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> to the piano when he was 3, and he quickly gained s a prodigy. But while he was studying with piano masters in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, he also was clowning in private musical reviews. By his early 20s, he had become a popular film and stage entertainer _ <PERSON> Denm </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> _ but his satiric barbs at <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and the Nazi moveent forced him to flee to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1940. He became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1948. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, `` I was received with great jubilation by no one,'' he said. `` It was strange to go into a store or a restaurant and nobody looked at me.'' Weary of a grueling schedule of musical comedy acts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotels and movie theaters, he finally scored a breakthrough in 1953 when he mounted a hit one-man show on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. The critics called him `` one of the funniest people in the world.'' He has entertained kings, presidents and prime ministers. `` The first president? It was <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. No, it was a Buick,'' he says. When he is not touring world stages, he visits his homes in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and on <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. At 80, he feels that `` luck, good fortune and stamina'' keep him clowning. `` I never have to get ` up' for a performance,'' he said. `` The moment I walk on the stage, no matter what my mood, if I have any regrets or feel sick or in pain, all that disappears. That is when the climax of my day occurs.''

<HEAD>Marcos Still Critical, But In Less Pain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained in very critical condition, but his pain and fever subsided after emergency surgery for an abdominal infection, a hospital spokesman said. The 71-year-old exiled leader underwent three hours of exploratory surgery Tuesday during which doctors discovered and drained an abscess on his pancreas. The abscess was suspected as a major source of the infection that has plagued <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for several weeks, but doctors said they could not be certain it was the only source. `` There was some response to the treatment and the pain and the fever appear to have decreased,'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>, assistant administrator of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been hospitalized since January and has been listed in very critical condition since May 18, when he suffered heart, kidney and lung failure. He remains on a respirator to assist his breathing and undergoes blood dialysis four times a week, <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said. Despite his ailments, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> makes his own decisions about his treatment and approved Tuesday's surgery, said his aide, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>. `` Just because he ca n't talk, he ca n't breathe, does n't mean he ca n't think,'' said <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, planned to stick to her schedule and sing her husband's favorite love songs at a reception Sunday, a family spokesman said. The gathering is to promote an album featuring the former first lady and Philippine vocalist <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Papin </PERSON>. `` She's still planning to be there, and she is planning to sing. After all, they're his favorite songs,'' said spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since being ousted in a popular revolt that carried <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the Philippine presidency in February 1986. He and his wife are under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for allegedly stealing more than $ 100 million from the Philippine treasury and using it to buy real estate and art works in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Because of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' illness, a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> severed him from the case, and he will not be prosecuted unless he recovers. No trial date has been set for Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $ 5 million bail.

 The dollar moved up against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Thursday, while stock prices gained moderately. The dollar closed at 143.05 yen, up 0.25 yen from Wednesday's close of 142.80 yen After opening higher at 142.98 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ranged between 142.73 and 143.10 yen during the day. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which rose 174.88 points Wednesday, added another 91.40 points, or 0.27 percent, closing at 33,718.29. Traders said Japanese investors' incentive to buy dollars was weaker Thursday because of reports that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> lowered its federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank reportedly said it should keep a close watch on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move to see if the decision really reflected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward easier money. Many investors still feel secure enough to invest in the dollar, and bought the currency due to uncertainties over the Chinese situation, said one dealer with a commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> speaking on condition of anonymity. On the stock exchange, dealers said the index's rise followed gains in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, although trading was still directionless due to remaining uncertainties over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>' analyst <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON> said, however, that news about the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> turmoil has a less negative impact on <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading than previously. `` Japanese investors have little feeling of insecurity about developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Researchers Report Progress Toward AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first AIDS vaccine tested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on humans triggered their immune systems into action, raising hopes that one vaccine may protect against many forms of the AIDS virus, researchers said. One top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> researcher said he is optimistic enough to recommend wide testing of the vaccine. `` We are making progress, and I think we will be able to make a vaccine eventually,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, head of AIDS vaccine testing at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases. Despite the encouraging results reported Wednesday, many important questions remain about whether this _ or any _ vaccine can keep people from catching AIDS. Similar vaccines have failed to prevent AIDS virus infections in chimpanzees. The vaccine is a synthetic copy of the outer coat of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS in humans. The goal of such vaccines is to warn the body's immune defenses about what the AIDS virus looks like. Then, if all goes well, the body's sentinel blood cells will quickly zero in on the virus and kill the invader if it somehow gets into the bloodstream. The initial human testing of this approach, carried out on 115 homosexual men who were not infected with AIDS, was intended primarily to see if the vaccine is safe. However, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said he will recommend that the next stage of testing be started to see if the vaccine actually protects people from AIDS infection. In the comparison study, a large group of people at risk of AIDS but not infected would randomly be given either the vaccine or dummy injections. In the study, those who received the vaccine produced microbe-attacking T-cells that recognized different strains of the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. Since the virus has mutated into many related forms, some doctors have worried that a vaccine that works against one variety of the virus might be useless against others. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s report was one of several on potential vaccine strategies presented at the week-long Fifth International Conference on AIDS. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said he did not think the men in the initial study received large enough doses of the vaccine to produce neutralizing antibodies, probes produced by another branch of the immune system _ the so-called B-cells _ that target viruses for destruction. Many researchers believe that for a vaccine to work, it will have to trigger the production of such neutralizing antibodies. In another report, Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Putney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Repligen </ORGANIZATION>, a biotechnology firm in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said his group had identified the single tiny region of the virus' outer coat that can prompt these killing antibodies. He and some other scientists believe that small fragments, rather than the whole coat, have a better chance of serving as a vaccine. And while not sure that it will work, he said, `` I'm certainly more optimistic than I was a year ago.'' Other researchers are exploring a variety of other vaccine strategies, including using killed whole viruses, harmless viruses that carry an extra gene or two from the AIDS virus or synthetic antibodies. Scientists are trying many different possibilities because they do not know which immune defense has the best chance of beating the virus. `` There are no known cases of recovery from AIDS, so we have no idea of the immune parameters that are important,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Girard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pasteur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Some researchers are trying to create a vaccine that will protect monkeys from a simian version of the AIDS virus. They believe this will give them important clues that can easily be adapted to a human AIDS vaccine. Researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, reported that while a vaccine made from inactivated virus failed to keep monkeys from getting infected, it seemed to slow down their disease so they lived longer. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, researchers vaccinated monkeys with weakened virus with somewhat different results. While four got infected, two did not, suggesting that the vaccine might have provided at least some protection. A French doctor also is reported to have tested at least one vaccine on humans.

 State agriculture officials are hunting for four hissing mouse-sized cockroaches that were set free by their owner and could breed and spread. <PERSON> Chloe </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Critter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> pet store, said a customer said he dumped the <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> hissing roaches in his backyard, fearing the state would jail him and confiscate the insects. `` He came in and said: ` Man, I was scared. I let them loose. I was afraid they'd put me in jail,''' she said Wednesday. `` He said he did n't want the -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> to hurt them.'' Ms. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> would not disclose the identity of the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> resident, not even to state agricultural agents. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> last week ordered the Critter Shop to stop selling the roaches, fearing if they got free, they might multiply across the South like the flying <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cockroach. When the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cockroach was first discovered in 1985 spreading through central and south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, scientists found 250,000 Asian cockroaches per acre, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Koelher </PERSON>, an entomologist with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> roaches, which can live up to five years compared to the German cockroaches' six-month lifespan, are bred by zoos and distributed by wholesalers as food for certain reptiles and monkeys. The exotic pet store got a shipment of 12 in January, sold six during the first four months, and the rest in two days after word got out they were trendy, cheap to feed and easy to maintain. `` Now that they say these are a bad thing, everybody wants to buy them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Koelher </PERSON> said the hissing roaches are nice pets because they are nice to handle, easy to care for and `` large enough so that you can see them.''

 A math teacher fired for failing to wear a tie to class has been vindicated in court, but could face the same problem next year if a school board decides to ban denim and require neckwear. `` If they're smart, they'll quit while they're behind. Otherwise, they'll get farther behind,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who was suspended for insubordination three times and finally fired last December. Judge <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> erred when it suspended the 46-year-old <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. King said a dress policy drafted by the superintendent last year was improperly imposed and <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had every right to ignore it. But under the judge's order, a similar dress code can be put into effect by the school board. Board member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Siders </PERSON>, who introduced the motion to fire <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> last Dec. 19, said the matter would come up at the board's meeting June 19. `` If they go on and say they'll ban any fabric made of denim, I wo n't go back,'' said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gallipolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, farmer who had taught across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for 19 years. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was hit with three suspensions of four, 11 and 30 days, the last two without pay, for challenging Superintendent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' requirement that male teachers wear dress pants and neckties. After he was fired, he returned to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to run his farm full time. While other teachers were preparing to give final exams, he was planting corn, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said in a telephone interview on his way to a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> appearance on today's `` Oprah Winfrey Show.'' King ordered the board to give <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> back pay for his 11-day suspension and up to $ 1,000 in legal costs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> did n't challenge the four-day suspension because he was paid. The 30-day suspension and firing still are to be addressed, but <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s wife and lawyer believe <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s action undermines the board's argument `` If they could n't suspend him, they sure as hell could n't fire him,'' <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> school board president <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and could n't be reached, according to someone who answered the phone at her Point Pleasant home. A reporter was unable to reach Chambers and board attorney <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose phone numbers were unlisted. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said he wore suits and sportcoats early in his teaching career to distinguish himself from his students, but later opted for the blue jeans and cotton shirts he wore around his farm. Chambers became superintendent last summer and enacted the dress code. Three other teachers who balked at the code followed normal grievance procedures and lost. King said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> and the others had a right to disobey the order, which was unlawful because it was unilaterally imposed by the superintendent.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and top Republicans say a press aide was solely responsible for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> memo comparing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record with that of a homosexual congressman, but Democrats are n't buying it. `` One staffer ca n't take the fall for an entire <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> political operation that's up to its knees in sewer-style politics,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, communications director of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, resigned Wednesday and took full blame for a memo comparing <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record to that of liberal Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. The memo was titled: `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>: Out of the Liberal Closet.'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, who worked in the press operation of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 campaign, said in resigning that he never intended `` to damage anyone's reputaion.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, never knew of the document. The White House put out word that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` disgusted by this entire incident,'' and top Republicans on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> hurried to distance themselves from it. `` The president was very upset,'' White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said in an interview reported today in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was upset. It went too far. It was wrong. The innuendo was wrong. It's wrong not because it damages our relationship with the Democrats. It's wrong because it's wrong. `` It's a terrible thing to happen at this time. It was not appropriate or fair,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had rebuked <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who had lunch with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said he accepted an apology from <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and considered the matter `` closed.'' And, in an interview, he spoke of working to give Republicans fairer treatment in the House. But other Democrats said <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> alone could not be responsible for a pattern of Republican smears, which Democrats contend began during the presidential campaign and have continued with misleading <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> leaks about Democrats. `` I think it's fair to ask President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he'll also have his handpicked party chairman, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, resign,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` The president himself has to be accountable for the activities of his henchman.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the second-ranking House Democrat, accused Republicans of `` playing good cop, bad cop'' _ allowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appear clean at the same time they were trashing <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. `` Here's a guy sent in by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to do the dirty deeds, and he calls and apologizes after the fact. If they're really upset about these tactics, all they have to do is fire somebody,'' he said. `` The Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are truly bitter about the way this thing happened on <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s first day as speaker.'' said Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> hit was part of a `` well-concocted strategy and I think it's one that has backfired because they overplayed their hand,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said. He said it is time for the Republicans to clean house at their campaign organization. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s not been damaged. If anything, he's been strengthened,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said. Republican leaders on Capitol <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> expressed dismay about the memo from their party organization. `` I was very distressed and rankled,'' said House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. `` I would guess this is a rather deliberate effort on the part of some to smear <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. `` This is We're disgusted by it.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, trying to end the political rancor in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was intent on maintaining a conciliatory tone toward the Republicans and declined to discuss the memo. In an interview, he promised to avoid the kind of strongarm parliamentary moves that angered Republicans under his predecessor, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` I think we've pushed it sometimes to the point where, while we were still within the rules, we were making maximum use of the power of the majority,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we should do that.''

<HEAD>Dollar Gains In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar gained against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while stock prices rose moderately despite continuing uncertainties in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The dollar ended trading at 143.10 yen, up 0.25 yen from Wednesday's 142.80-yen finish. After opening higher at 142.98 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ranged between 142.73 and 143.10 yen. <PERSON> Masafumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyama </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said dollar-buying incentives were stronger than selling incentives, despite an expectation that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may ease its monetary policy. `` Recent developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have a stronger impact, because speculation over a relaxation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary policy has been an issue for quite a while and is no longer fresh news,'' he said. Theoretically, he said, the market could shift to dollar selling because of the narrowing interest-rate gap between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` But investors are still buying the dollar, which shows how strong their demand for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency is,'' <PERSON> Koyama </PERSON> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed the day at 33,718.29, gaining 91.40 points, or 0.27 percent. The index rose 174.88 points the previous day. Stocks moved higher almost across the board. Dealers attributed the gains to an uptrend begun the previous day, as well as to overnight rises on overseas markets. <PERSON> Kazuyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> gained despite turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> mainly because Japanese investors' buying interest was strong. `` Trading was thin and directionless because of the uncertainties in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but many investors bought cheaper issues following the four consecutive days of losses which ended Tuesday,'' he said. Other dealers said the market's expectation that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would relax its monetary policy also prompted buying. Low interest rates are generally good news for stock investors. The volume traded on the market's first section was estimated at 650 million shares, up from Wednesday's 600 million. Among the winners were construction and automobile issues.

<HEAD>Consumer Borrowing Slows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pace of borrowing slowed sharply in April as Americans took out $ 2.73 billion more in debt than they retired, the government says. Consumer credit in April rose 4.7 percent on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from 6.4 percent in March and 9.5 percent in February, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. It was the slowest advance since a 3.5 percent gain last September. It also represented a sharp retreat from the 8.5 percent rise in consumer debt during all of 1988. Economists said the news was consistent with other signs that economic growth is slowing as the record peacetime expansion extends into its seventh year.

<TEXT>
 A drug to help treat severe cases of <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s disease, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, has been approved for public use. The drug, selegiline, will be part of the standard therapy for Parkinson's, which uses another drug, levodopa, to treat the symptoms that include slowness of movement, muscular rigidity, instability and tremors. Levodopa, after several years of use, often decreases in effectiveness, even with increased doses, said the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The drug is aimed at the 20,000 to 50,000 people, most of whom are over 40, with severe Parkinson's. The drug previously was available to the most severely ill while the company making the drug continued to gather data on its effectiveness. Scientists believe <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s results from reduced levels in the brain of dopamine, a naturally produced substance that helps regulate movement.

<HEAD>Thailand Says China Turmoil May Affect Cambodia Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is concerned that the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may delay the settlement of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said today. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a principal player in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as the main backer of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of the three-party guerrilla coalition opposing the pro-Vietnamese government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jete </PERSON> <PERSON> Sucharitkhul </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> government was `` very concerned'' about developments in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where pro-democracy protests since mid-April escalated until troops shot to death hundreds of people last weekend. `` Usually the -LRB- Chinese -RRB- government follows the party line, if there is a power struggle you can imagine that they will be very busy internally and not be able to pay as much attention to the -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- issue as they have in the past,'' he said. But <PERSON> Jete </PERSON> said he did not think that apparant divisions in the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership would change <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think there will be a shift, just that they will be able to pay less attention to the issue. But nobody can tell at the moment as we do n't know the extent of the infighting,'' he said. Recent peace talks have brought the various <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> factions closer to a solution to the 10-year war. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978, has pledged to withdraw all its troops stationed there by Sept. 30. But the major stumbling block to a peace settlement has been the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who were ousted from power by the Vietnamese invasion. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed as many as 1 million Cambodians from 1975 to 1978 as it violently tried to turn the country into a radical agrarian commune. Recent peace talks have focused on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> should be allowed to participate in a future coalition government. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> announced last week that <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, the man who presided over their rule, wished to resign his last official post in the organization. Diplomats dismissed the move as a ploy to present a more acceptable face in future negotiations. The government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> has insisted that <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and other leaders be removed before the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is allowed any share of power. There are unconfirmed reports from Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> that the shadowy leader, believed to be in his early 60's, is currently in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for medical treatment.

 On <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ground, some wept and shook with stories of a massacre left behind. At the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, student <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said he decided to return home after a truckload of soldiers aimed machine guns at him on a street in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` The whole situation is just horrible chaos, and it scares me to think of anyone not being able to get out, much less the Chinese who obviously must stay,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. He shook as he recalled Wednesday ducking when soldiers aimed at him and several others. No shots were fired. Hundreds of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> arrived home as armed clashes and government instability in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> prompted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to evacuate dependents of staff members. Busloads of foreigners today rushed to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport in hopes of catching emergency flights. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has chartered flights from two airlines. Meanwhile, across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Chinese students held demonstrations in support of their brethren at home, officials denounced the killings, tourists canceled trips to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and a new hot line in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> continued the formidible task of locating missing kin. And eyewitnesses told their stories. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Brubaker </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> airport that he spent a night with pro-democracy demonstrators in their tent city in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> before the massacre. `` I saw one all by himself try to stop a tank rolling over a barricade; just him against the might of the big army!'' said <PERSON> Brubaker </PERSON>, who went to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> only a month ago to study the Chinese language. Tears streaming down her cheeks, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> of the Chinese city of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to attend school in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think the students try hard to make life better for us all,'' she said. `` Why did they have to die?'' <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Suitor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> of Setauket, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Feld </PERSON>'s mother from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and told how they arrived in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> tired, dirty, and without their luggage after 25 hours in line at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport The couple, both professors, were detained and beaten by Army troops as they were taking photographs Sunday a few blocks from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where soldiers killed or wounded thousands of people to crush a pro-democracy movement. Many were overjoyed to be home. `` <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> never seemed so beautiful,'' Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said as he walked out of customs at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport Wednesday. He was one of 29 members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physician </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> who were in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for an exchange of medical and technical ideas.

<HEAD>Colorado Health Department Cites Rocky Flats For 25 Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A plant that makes triggers for nuclear bombs was slapped with 25 state health violations the day after federal agents launched an inquiry into illegal dumping and burning of hazardous wastes at the facility. The state's action Wednesday against the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plant was independent of the federal investigation and the timing of the two announcements was `` coincidence,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Looby </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The state accused the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>, of improperly storing wastes, failing to monitor groundwater adequately and storing hazardous wastes in leaking drums. `` The violations involved raised some serious questions in our mind about the overall ability of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> to manage the plant,'' said <PERSON> Looby </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heintz </PERSON> said he had not seen the health department allegations. `` But I would be surprised if there are any new violations and it is just a matter of interpretation whether or not the deficiencies are cleared up or in the process of being cleared up,'' <PERSON> Heintz </PERSON> said. The plant 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> makes plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs. Agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> carried out search warrants there Wednesday for the second day in a row. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said plant employees allegedly concealed contamination and illegally treated, stored and disposed of hazardous and radioactive waste. <PERSON> Looby </PERSON> said the state's order included a total of 24 citations for violation of rules for monitoring hazardous waste in groundwater; unapproved storage of hazardous and mixed wastes; leaking hazardous waste drums; inadequate record-keeping and personnel training, and failure to maintain proper aisle space in waste storage areas. `` No individual instance is a terribly nasty violation,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, director of the health department's Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division. `` The concern is that in the aggregate, it shows that the facility has a good deal of difficulty in managing its hazardous waste ... in order to stay in compliance with state standards,'' <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said. The order gives DOE and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> 10 days to request a meeting to discuss the order. The state then has a month to finalize the order and to set a compliance deadline for each violation. The maximum penalty for noncompliance is $ 25,000 per violation per day, officials said. Rocky Flats has been dogged by safety and environmental problems since it began operations in 1953, but particularly in recent years. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> identified it as the most environmentally hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry because toxic chemicals contaminate an underground reservoir and threaten nearby city water supplies. In October, the agency closed Rocky Flats' main plutonium reprocessing building for safety violations. Two months later, the agency reported 32 new safety problems at the plant. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has announced plans to close <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> in the next 20 years in a consolidation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons plants. In a previous federal probe of a nuclear weapons complex in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> examined <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> handling of hazardous waste at its <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, reservation. No criminal prosecution resulted.

<TEXT>
 Five defendants pleaded guilty to reduced charges and agreed to pay more than $ 300,000 in penalties in a million-dollar clam theft case, leaving only the accused `` Clamscam'' kingpin still on trial. The plea bargain came six weeks into the complex trial of one of the state's biggest white-collar crime cases ever. The agreement also resulted in the dropping of charges against a sixth defendant. <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> last week urged both sides to negotiate a plea bargain to reduce time and costs. Without the agreement, lawyers had predicted a trial of at least three months, followed by trials in three other counties. `` We've saved the taxpayers lots of money in court time,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sainsbury </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's fraud division. `` While you never get everything you want, we've accomplished some of our goals. The trial was set to resume today for <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, 50, former president of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He faces multiple felony charges of stealing at least $ 1.8 million of geoducks, a type of giant clam, by underreporting harvests from state clam beds and encouraging divers to go outside legal clamming areas. <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> has blamed any illegal harvesting on divers acting on their own and claims he took fewer clams from Puget Sound and Hood Canal than he was entitled to under state leases. The geoduck, pronounced `` gooey-duck'' after an Indian word for `` dig deep,'' weighs as much as 10 pounds and is raised mainly for export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where it can fetch $ 12 a pound. The industry began in 1970. Under the agreement, the five defendants pleaded guilty without admitting any wrongdoing, a so-called <PERSON> Alford </PERSON> plea. The only defendant to be sentenced Wednesday was <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hondle </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, who entered a modified guilty plea to misdemeanor theft. He was given 30 days in jail or on work release, put on a year's probation and fined $ 500. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to felony charges of conspiracy, theft and trafficking in stolen property. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 33, of <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to theft and trafficking in stolen property; <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>, 58, of Federal Way, and her company, T.C. <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to trafficking in stolen property. Their sentencing was postponed to an unspecified date.

 Larger than the average lobbyist, two cows called on the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> with a group of concerned dairy farmers who demanded higher prices for milk in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Dairy cows <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kat </PERSON> quietly chewed their cuds while two dozen farmers and their supporters rallied on the Statehouse steps Tuesday. The farmers said high land prices were pushing them out of business and threatening the state's dwindling dairy industry. A proposal in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would increase milk prices 2 cents per quart, and the money would be distributed back to state dairy farmers. `` It's either pay now or pay more later,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> of the 2,200-member Agri-Mark, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s largest dairy cooperative. `` It's not a tax, it's a rate hike.'' The farmers argue that at $ 2.12 per gallon on average, the price of milk in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is lower than the national average. According to the state agriculture department, there were 3,000 dairy farms in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in 1960 and only 460 active farms today. Production dropped from 800 million pounds of milk in 1985 to about 470 million pounds last year.

<HEAD>Aquarium's Whale Exhibit Harpooned by Canadians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Canadian government has blocked efforts by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Shedd Aquarium to buy three beluga whales from Eskimos near <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, officials say. The aquarium had planned to buy the whales this summer for its $ 43 million `` Oceanarium,'' a marine mammal pavilion due to be opened next year. But under pressure from environmentalists, the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> government blocked the deal. Canadian officials gave no reason, but promised to explain their denial by next week, said aquarium spokeswoman <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>. However, an unidentified official of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Oceans </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> that his agency does n't think the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> aquarium has experts on its staff who know how to care for belugas. He also expressed concern that the aquarium's new addition would n't be ready by the time the belugas were to be captured. But <PERSON> Shedd </PERSON>'s assistant director, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON>, said the aquarium does have qualified staff members to care for the whales, who would have been housed outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> until the Oceanarium is finished. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, wildlife coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, hailed the ministry's decision. `` It's a tradition for the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to kill belugas and eat them, but it's not a tradition for them to sell them to the <ORGANIZATION> Shedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquarium </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. But Shedd officials contend the best way to educate the public about the need to protect whales is to display them in aquariums. Beluga whales are not considered an endangered species, and under Canadian law, <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said, Eskimos near <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> are allowed to exercise their native hunting rights to capture a half dozen or so whales each summer. Beluga whales are 10 to 15 feet long and resemble dolphins. Ms. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said the aquarium will acquire three much larger and more plentiful <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> black whales for the new pavilion.

<HEAD>HUD Audit: Village Officials Gave Preferential Treatment</HEAD>

 Officials in a predominately white <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> village that is home to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, distributed federally subsidized homes to politically connected people and excluded blacks, according to a report published today. One person who received such preferential treatment was <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s cousin, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccimarro </PERSON>, who was selected to buy a $ 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> house in <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported, citing a 1984 audit by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> was supervisor of the town of <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, which includes Island Park, at the time and was elected to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> shortly thereafter, the Times said. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> denied any favoritism was involved, and said he had no role in the selection process, the Times said. `` There's no reason to believe anything was inappropriate,'' said a statement released by <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s office. Preferential treatment also was accorded to <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> McGann </PERSON>, a village board member and high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> administrator, whose son, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, received a $ 44,500 house, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, citing the audit. Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, also denied any favoritism took place. Under a federal program to build affordable housing for minorities, <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the early 1980s received money to build 285 houses for lower-income families. Island Park, population 4,200 and 97 percent white, received enough money to build 44 homes to be sold at $ 40,000 to $ 64,000. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> proposed that 17 of the 22 houses to be built during the project's second phase be sold to blacks from nearby areas, but none were Twelve of the 44 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> houses have since been resold at large profit; one went for $ 270,000, the Times said. The audit did not say whether those selected for the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> houses met the program's eligibility requirements. The buyers included the niece of the village clerk, the niece of a village trustee, two village supervisors, a lawyer who is soon to become a village justice and the daughter of a village employee, the Times said. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers to reach lower-income buyers, especially minorities. But some residents were tipped off, and by the time the ads appeared, 22 buyers had been selected, the Times said. The 1984 audit recommended disciplinary action against Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> and the village, but neither was penalized. Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> last year was promoted to regional <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> administrator after <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> lobbied <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House on her behalf, the Times said. A copy of the audit was mailed anonymously to the Times, which said it then requested and received a copy from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to verify its authenticity. `` This program was a mockery,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pless </PERSON>, who did the audit and later quit in disgust that no action was taken. `` It took everyone's tax money and gave it to the people who did n't need it.''

 Assailants shot a Palestinian man to death on his hospital bed today in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports claimed he collaborated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Another suspected collaborator was shot and seriously wounded in a separate incident, the reports said. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers sealed the homes of three Palestinians accused of throwing firebombs at troops. An 18-year-old Palestinian also was reported wounded in the leg in a clash with troops in <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The fatal attack occurred in <LOCATION> Rafidiyeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Taleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamin </PERSON>, 55, had been convalescing from injuries suffered 10 days earlier in a clubbing and stabbing attack in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' old city, two hospital doctors said. `` A group of people entered the hospital at 5 a.m. They forced a male nurse and a relative to leave the room. Then they opened fire, killing him instantly,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rafidiyeh </ORGANIZATION>'s director, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinar </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview. Another doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Yamin </PERSON> was shot once in the head. The army confirmed the slaying and said police were investigating. <PERSON> Yamin </PERSON> was the 49th Palestinian slain by other Palestinians since the Palestinian uprising began. Most have been accused of helping <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities or dealing in drugs and prostitution. A total of 510 Palestinians have been killed in the 18-month rebellion against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule, most in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Twenty-two Israelis also have died in the unrest. The second shooting also occurred in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Arab assailants shot <PERSON> Fayel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawalha </PERSON>, 48, seriously wounding him in the head, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. <PERSON> Fawalha </PERSON> was reportedly evacuated by an Israeli helicopter after being treated by soldiers at the scene. The army confirmed the man was shot and said troops had closed off <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The shootings came a day after a 30-year-old man was hacked to death in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> with a hatchet and his naked body chained to an electric pole. Arab reporters said he was a collaborator. The army suggested the motive for Wednesday's slaying was criminal. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was quoted by the daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today as urging that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> put a halt to announcing new settlement building in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` The announcements of new settlements are politically problematic even if they -LRB- <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders -RRB- do n't go through with it,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> noted. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has built some 130 settlements, as homes for 70,000 Jews who live among 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has frequently criticized the settlements as an obstacle to peace. `` It's something that I wish there was a sensitivity to this,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. He said the settlement issue gave critics of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` fodder for the cannon fire, and believe me, they want to unload on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` It makes it more problematic for those of us who are strong defenders'' of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> added. A new public opinion survey, meanwhile, showed 53 percent of Israelis would object to dismantling the settlements as part of a peace agreement. Forty-two percent of 579 of the Israelis interviewed this week by the <ORGANIZATION> Dahaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said they favored removing the settlements, the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> daily reported. No margin of error for the poll was given. Troops maintained a curfew for a fifth day on the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, confining more than 700,000 residents to their homes indefinitely. The restrictions were lifted for two hours in the town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> so residents could purchase food. The homes sealed shut were in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp. One belonged to <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrar </PERSON>, 24, and housed his wife and one child, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The other suspects were not immediately identified. The army said the three Palestinians were suspected firebomb assailants and also accused them of belonging to the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In a communique, the army said the Palestinians were accused of throwing several firebombs at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops during April. `` They are also suspected of additional activity including threats on those who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, placing roadblocks and tire burnings,'' it said. On Wednesday soldiers demolished the homes of two Palestinians in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> who were convicted of firebomb attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> claims that house wreckings and sealings are an effective deterrent against attacks.

<TEXT>
 More than 25 years after their game was canceled because of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination, alumni from two rival high schools took to the gridiron to complete their last football season. <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> high schools have long had the hottest scholastic rivalry in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. On the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, the schools were holding pep rallies and preparing to cap their seasons with the annual double homecoming. But an assassin's bullet in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> prompted officials to cancel the game. `` If you beat <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, that was it. That was your season _ nothing else mattered,'' said <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON>, who played wide receiver as a <LOCATION> Bowie </LOCATION> senior in 1963 and coached Wednesday night's game `` I think at the time most of us thought it was important to play the game. You do n't actually complete your high-school season when you ca n't play your main rival.'' Alumni from the schools settled the score Wednesday night with a spirited game of seven-man touch football before 400 spectators at Bowie Stadium. The home team won, 20-8. The contest was n't pretty. The Bowie Bears threw bombs on almost every play and the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foxes </ORGANIZATION> threw so many laterals that it resembled a volleyball game. But that did n't bother the players. `` It was a lot of fun,'' said <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinar </PERSON>. `` It was just friends against friends.'' The contest brought back memories of that fateful day. `` I was excited,'' <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> alumnus <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> recalled about the week leading to the canceled 1963 game. `` Then our dear president passed away, which was terrible. It was nice to get to play again.'' `` The whole country was down because of the shooting, but we were down because of the game,'' said <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>' teammate, <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Florez </PERSON>. `` It's a game you look forward to all year.'' Or look forward to for a quarter century. Alumni from both schools had talked for years about playing the canceled game. Last week, <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>'s Class of'64 _ which is celebrating its 25th reunion this week _ decided to stage the game. Those who took part were glad they did. `` There was a piece missing from our lives when we did n't get to play that game,'' <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> said.

 Books that advocate Nazism and question whether the Holocaust occurred were on sale last week at state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s house, says a researcher concerned that fellow legislators are not challenging <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. `` No one is speaking out against the ideas of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. He has not changed his views even though he says he has,'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a former grand wizard of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, was elected to the state legislature from a nearly all-white district in February. He still heads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes the civil rights of whites. His house serves as headquarters for the organization. <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> said she was upset that some <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Republicans had accepted <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. `` They honestly do n't know what to do with him,'' she said. `` They think if you ignore him, he'll go away.'' <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> said she and other researchers purchased anti-Jewish and extremist material from <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s house in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION> as recently as Saturday. Among the materials <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> said she bought were: _ `` The Turner Diaries,'' described as the bible of the Order, a white supremacist organization founded by members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. _ `` Imperium,'' which argues for the preservation of Western culture through the practice of Nazi racist policies. _ `` Did Six Million Really Die? The Truth at Last,'' which argues that the Holocaust was grossly exaggerated to gain sympathy for a Jewish homeland. Also available were books on breeding a master race, <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> denied that he was selling the books. Asked how <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> and her associates could buy them, he said, `` It might have been some old stock.'' `` This is nothing new,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` I've sold a wide range of books. I think people have a right to read all points of view.''

 The new head of the <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said a `` spiritual reawakening'' would help reverse declining membership as the church enters its third century. `` I really think a new day is dawning,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> SalmonCampbell </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, after she was elected moderator Wednesday at the church's 201st <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. She defeated two challengers. The church's chief spokesperson made it clear her main goal is to spread the word of God. `` We need a spiritual reawakening, and I think we are on the brink of it,'' she told a reporter. Known locally as `` Rev. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>,'' she is the second black clergywoman from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to gain a national religious post recently. Earlier this year <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became associate bishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` I'm proud of my sister and I'm proud to stand with her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> SalmonCampbell </PERSON> said. `` We are both leaders of our churches particularly at a time when our denominations are under such fire and criticism. Clergywomen bring a unique perspective to the church.'' In becoming moderator _ the seventh woman in the church to win the post since 1971, and the first clergywoman _ she received 303 of the 603 second ballot votes to defeat the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Her first official act was to appoint a vice moderator, the Rev. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caroline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who had formally placed her name in nomination. With church membership now below 3 million, or around 25 percent less than it was in the 1960s, she said a top priority was to bring new worshipers to the 11,573 Presbyterian churches around the country. She said she would help raise $ 15 million for an evangelism drive. `` The church must present a religious message, a message of clarity as to who we are as Presbyterians. We must neither be bland nor dull. The church should speak out as to how Christ would speak. We must talk more about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' she said.

 Gunmen killed a leading witness in a robbery trial after shooting two of his friends while they waited for him to come home. Investigators said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 38, arrived at <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>' house late Tuesday and were met by at least two gunmen, who shot the two in the head after ordering them to lie on the living room floor. The gunmen ransacked the house and at one point made a telephone call and complained that `` he'' had n't arrived, police said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>, 22, who was <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>' roommate, returned home some hours later and was killed as he walked toward the back door, police said. The account of the events was provided by <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, who was shot in the head and arm but survived. He called police after the gunmen left the house and was placed under police guard after being treated for his wounds. <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> was to have testified Wednesday in the kidnapping and robbery trial of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, charged in a September 1988 attack on a waitress in the parking lot of a restaurant.

<HEAD>Judge Assesses More Than $1,000 For Marital Status Discrimination</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A landlord who agreed to rent a house to an unmarried couple and then reneged, citing his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> values, has been ordered to pay more than $ 1,000 in damages and penalties. A judge refused to treble the damages, however, as the law allows, because he said the landlord acted out of `` sincerely held religious beliefs.'' Administrative law Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> ruled Wednesday that Layle French must pay $ 368.50 in compensatory damages and $ 400 for mental anguish to <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON>, as well as $ 300 in civil penalties to the state. The judge ruled in March that <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> violated a state law prohibiting discrimination based on marital status by refusing to rent a house to <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON> and her then-fiance. French `` reflected upon his action prior to engaging in the discriminatory conduct and weighed his duties under the law against his religious beliefs,'' <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said. French's argument that the discrimination statute should take a back seat to his Christian values had attracted wide support in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the country. French is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. His attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said Wednesday he plans to take the case to the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he is `` saddened about a man who is fighting a trend, and that is a general moral decay of the country, and the state has seen fit not to promote what he's doing but rather to promote the moral decay.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he was especially distressed at the civil penalty because he claimed French was upholding the state law banning fornication. He said he had not been able to reach French to inform him of the ruling. <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> noted in his decision that when French first agreed to rent to <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON> and her then-fiance on Feb. 22, 1988, he knew that the couple was not married. Two days later, <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> noted, French called <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON> `` and informed her that he could not rent the property to her because cohabitation by two adults of the opposite sex was not in accord with his religious beliefs.'' By that time, <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON> had given up her rental mobile home. She later married her fiance.

 A man who went looking for his estranged wife in violation of a court order shot and killed three people at a dairy farm, then turned the gun on himself after failing to find her, police said. The killer, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehring </PERSON>, died at a hospital a few hours after the shootings Wednesday. The victims were the couple who owned the farm, <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutheda </PERSON> LaCrosse and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCrosse </PERSON>, both 63, and <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 43, a dairy truck driver. <PERSON> Gehring </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehring </PERSON>, was visiting the farm Tuesday evening when her husband arrived and drove off in her car. Deputies arrived and drove the woman to her apartment in nearby <LOCATION> Puyallup </LOCATION>, said Capt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Poythress </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department. <PERSON> Gehring </PERSON>, apparently believing his wife was still at the house, arrived the next morning armed with a .22 - caliber He shot <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, who had arrived to pick up a load of milk, then went into the house and shot and killed the LaCrosse couple. He then shot himself in the head, said Sgt. <PERSON> Prentis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsinger </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department. Friends and authorities said the LaCrosses did not know <PERSON> Gehring </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gehring </PERSON>, a 35-year-old sawyer at a local wood mill, was under a court order to stay away from his wife of 18 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Gehring </PERSON> had told authorities that her husband was threatening to kill her. Neighbors said the LaCrosses had operated the 400-cow dairy for 23 years and were well-known in the rural community south of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. `` They were such good neighbors, they would help anyone,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Schelbert </PERSON>, who lived across from the LaCrosse farm for 20 years. `` When we had a sick animal, he would come out and help us. ... This couple has touched a lot of lives.'' <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> left a wife and four children, authorities said. `` This type of thing is unheard of in our rural community. You try to look for reasons,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasmussen </PERSON>, a state representative and dairy farmer.

 <LOCATION> HOPEDALE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Come home, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>. All is forgiven. Twenty-nine years after his death, the `` King of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'' has finally won back the hearts of those who live in his hometown. <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> _ at least his legend _ will be the guest of honor this weekend as <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and some stars of `` Gone With the Wind'' commemorate the film's 50th anniversary by re-enacting the famous Twelve Oaks barbecue scene and attending a screening of a restored version of the movie. The 850 residents of this eastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> was born Feb. 1, 1901, have n't always regarded him as a favorite son. The gawky, gap-toothed, big-eared boy never returned to the county after he moved about 80 miles northwest to <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> in 1917. `` Most folks around here were angry because he never came back,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cope </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` But recently, we're seeing a real turnaround. There is no longer any of that resentment we felt even after we started honoring him on his birthday in 1984.'' <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an 86-year-old <LOCATION> Hopedale </LOCATION> native, said she has forgiven <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> for never returning. She has become a local celebrity herself because she once rejected <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>'s request for a birthday kiss. `` He said ` This is my 16th birthday. Do you want to be the first one to kiss me?' I said, no I did not,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` He had a real way with the girls. Oh, he had lots and lots of girlfriends. But not me,'' she said, smiling. `` My father would have killed me.'' <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has been celebrating <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>'s birthday each year since 1984, hoping that fascination with the actor and his films will give a boost to an economy hurt by a decline in coal mining, said <PERSON> Cope </PERSON>, who also is county treasurer. The county's unemployment rate was 10.8 percent in April. Other famous native sons simply do n't have the drawing power. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>, credited as the author of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, was born in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, 10 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hopedale </LOCATION>. And Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> is better know for his last stand at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bighorn </LOCATION> than his first breath in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rumley </LOCATION>, about 10 miles to the northwest. A granite monument honoring <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> was erected in 1986 at the site of his home in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, where his family moved when he was a child. By coincidence, the house was razed in 1960 _ the year <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> died. The <ORGANIZATION> Gable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> hopes to raise enough money through special events and corporate donations to build and operate a museum-theater to display <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> memorabilia and show his films. The three-day commemoration of the film's golden anniversary begins Friday with an auction of memorabilia at the <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, a roadhouse-turned-restaurant that <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> was believed to have frequented in his younger days. Items to be sold include an original program from the movie's 1939 premiere, a sepia movie still of Gable and <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> as <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, and a first-issue postage stamp honoring <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, author of `` Gone With the Wind,'' signed by <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON>, who portrayed the long-suffering <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON> On Saturday, residents and stars from the movie _ including <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, who played one of the <LOCATION> Tarleton </LOCATION> twins _ will don Civil War-era attire to re-enact the barbecue scene at an American Legion hall. Also during the weekend, <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> and other stars will be asked to leave hand imprints and signatures in cement. They include <PERSON> Butterfly </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, who played Prissy, the maid; <PERSON> Cammie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, who portrayed <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON>, the ill-fated daughter of <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, who appeared in the film as an infant. <PERSON> Cope </PERSON> said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON>, son of the film's producer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON>, plans an appearance. The reunion of the stars ends Sunday with a showing of a restored print of the film in Wheeling, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 25 miles to the southeast

 A planeload of Americans arrived on a special evacuation flight today from chaotic <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with stories of friends and children slain in the Chinese capital and gunshots punctuating their escape to the airport. Some were greeted in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by relieved and tearful relatives, and staff member from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> helped some evacuees who had no money with loans or tickets on credit. `` So many children were killed,'' said <PERSON> Terese </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, after arriving with 320 people on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet that had been chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. She said she had been teaching at the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and saw many victims of the assault by Chinese troops on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. `` One couple bicycled from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> 10 kilometers back to the university with their 7-year-old child, who died. They were running away, and they mowed them down.'' Similar stories were being told around the world as thousands of foreigners left <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on regular flights and special planes arranged by foreign governments. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said she had to lie flat on the floor of the car taking her to the airport Monday because there was shooting, and then had to wait almost four days to get a flight. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> charter flight's load of 320 people included 30 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> who escaped from a coal mine in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, some dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and a few people of other nationalities. Most were to fly on to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> immediately. `` It was dreadful,'' said the wife of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat who asked that her name not be used. `` We had friends who died. We used to go out every night to the square to talk to the people there, and we even brought our kids. Nobody expected to be mowed down.'' Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said it was getting `` pretty dangerous for Americans'' in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> because authorities were blaming the turmoil on `` Western influence.'' At her university, she said students piled up bodies of victims inside the gates to keep soldiers out of the campus, and she had heard that soldiers stripped some bodies of identification and burned them. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, evacuee <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, 21, said she had been in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> when the massacre began. She said she saw a crowd drag away two policemen and people enraged by the shooting trying to destroy army vehicles. `` I got really scared. Someone came rushing toward me and said, ` Go and look for yourself, the Chinese are shooting the Chinese.' It was horrible. I just did n't want to see people dying,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who had been at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Foreign Studies University, said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials had given British students 10 minutes to pack. Her evacuation flight landed today at <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> airport outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I regret leaving the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people behind to that vicious government, that awful government. All I want to say is that the whole world has got to know that that government is capable of doing that.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haugen </PERSON> said at first he wanted to stay and endure the unrest that has wracked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since mid-April. Then came the weekend massacre in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and his Chinese friends told him their acquaintances and relatives were among the dead. `` It was just short of being a madhouse. Stores are all closed. ... People are n't staying in their houses ... they're milling around on the street trying to find out what's going on,'' the 25-year-old from <LOCATION> Camano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday after his arrival in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` I saw a soldier's body, burned, hanging from the bridge. That made me get the hell out of there,'' Australian tourist <PERSON> Jimie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. He said people told him the soldier had killed children and women. `` We were shot at by the tanks at the Peking Hotel doorway. They were shooting at anything that moved,'' said <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, a French tour guide, after arriving in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with a group of 40 tourists. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations stepped up specially arranged flights to evacuate terrified foreigners from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after they strongly urged their citizens to leave the Chinese capital. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> reportedly extended their evacuation orders today to include the industrial port of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city, because of growing tension there.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> ended talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials after winning a commitment for new F-16 fighter sales and promising not to provoke a regional arms race by producing nuclear weapons. She made the promise in an address Wednesday to a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in which she urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to work aggressively for a broad-based political settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and said that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s fledgling democracy deserves continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and economic assistance. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, a 1974 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was attending <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s commencement ceremonies today and addressing members of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday she is scheduled to meet with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Saturday. The F-16 sale, said to be worth $ 1.4 billion, will give <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> a total 100 of the sophisticated warplanes. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that unidentified Pakistani officials said Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to try to persuade the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to accept the departure of Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> from office, with whom the guerrillas have refused to negotiate, as a step that could lead to negotiations. During her visit, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> witnessed the signing of agreements providing for $ 465 million to help <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> finance housing, narcotics and education programs. The agreements are part of a $ 2.28 billion, six-year aid package designed to support <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s economic development, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is the third largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Pakistanis are grateful for such assistance, the prime minister told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, because `` your military assistance has helped maintain a relative balance in the region. It has contributed to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s sense of security.'' The prime minister's address was repeatedly interrupted by applause, especially when she addressed long-standing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is on the verge of acquiring nuclear arms. `` Speaking for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, I can declare that we do not possess nor do we intend to make a nuclear device; that is our policy,'' she said. `` We are committed to a regional approach to the nuclear problem and we remain ready to accept any safeguards, inspection and verification that are applied on a non-discriminatory regional basis,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has long advocated creating a nuclear weapons-free zone in south <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and added: `` A first step in that direction could be a nuclear test-ban agreement between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and its neighbors. ... We are prepared for any negotiation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region. `` We will not provoke a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent,'' she said. The prime minister mentioned no other country by name. But <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s regional rival, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which detonated a nuclear device some 15 years ago, has resisted agreeing to test-ban and nuclear weapons-free zones unless such arrangements also include <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a nuclear-weapons state.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Firing of Producer Who Aired Mayor Impersonator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appeals court has upheld the firing of a radio station producer for airing an impersonation of then-Mayor <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> in 1982. The state court said that the incident `` was not exactly ` The War of the Worlds''' but that <ORGANIZATION> WRKO-AM </ORGANIZATION> had every right to fire <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yovino </PERSON> for inviting an impersonator on air to take calls from the audience as `` His Honor.'' `` He pretended to be the mayor, although greatly exaggerating the mannerisms of the persona of the real mayor,'' Judge <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Broad as the caricature may have been, the impersonator induced a flurry of phone calls to <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in which the callers made unflattering observations about what the ` mayor' was saying on the air. Upholding a lower-court ruling, the judge said <PERSON> Yovino </PERSON>'s failure to ensure that the audience knew the `` mayor'' was an impersonator amounted to a serious error.

 A blizzard of $ 20 bills on a highway stopped rush-hour traffic cold and sorely tempted a man who returned $ 440,000 after staring for hours at a 45-pound sack of cash on his kitchen table. More than $ 500,000 fell out the back of a <ORGANIZATION> Loomis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> truck about 9 a.m. Wednesday on Interstate 10 near downtown, police said. One sack broke, and $ 20 bills littered the four-lane highway. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincaid </PERSON> said at least $ 100,000 was still missing. `` With the turbulence of the traffic, the money was flying in the air like a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> commercial,'' said police shift supervisor <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON>. He said at least 20 motorists stopped to grab cash, causing a half-mile traffic jam. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> grabbed a canvas sack of money, threw it in his car and drove home, where he stacked the cash on the table and counted it. He turned in the money to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> five hours later. `` It was $ 440,000, and I said this was too much money,'' <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said. `` My conscience would have really bothered me.'' Others were n't quite so honest. Police charged two men with theft for allegedly grabbing $ 3,840. In addition, police got license plate numbers of about 20 other suspected cash-grabbers and planned to pursue them. `` This is an education in greed in people,'' <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said. Police said the driver of the truck apparently did n't secure the back doors before setting out from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> to the one in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

 Hundreds of foreigners rushed to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s international airport today to board hastily arranged flights and evacuate the tense capital Airlines from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dispatched jetliners to carry out citizens unnerved by the carnage and random shooting by troops roaming the city. About 270 Americans left <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Capital Airport aboard a special <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight for <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where another 130 were to board and then head to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` I was at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Hotel Monday watching people get shot all day and that was enough,'' said an American student from he <ORGANIZATION> Bejing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> who watched troops, their rifles blazing, charge repeatedly at crowds of bystanders. `` After being at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> that night and watching them shooting and shooting and shooting, I reached my threshold for destruction,'' said the student, who was waiting for a <ORGANIZATION> Dragonair </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> before making his way back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. He asked not to be identified. A <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that was turned away from Chinese airspace on a flight from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> earlier today departed again for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after receiving permission from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities, an airline official said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers stormed thousands of pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> over the weekend, killing hundreds in the most violent suppression of a popular movement in communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. On Wednesday, soldiers fired on a diplomatic compound, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ordered diplomatic dependents at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and all non-essential personnel to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Officials also urged all other Americans to leave. `` We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, and the biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pulling them out of town,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> told reporters at the airport. `` We're watching things very closely. We think there are enough signs of difficulties that we'd better take care of our people and get them out fast.'' Dozens of cars and buses plastered with the flags of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made their way along the picturesque, tree-lined route to the airport. The <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> ambassador's black <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> pulled up to the terminal near the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador's navy-blue <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>. About 1,000 people crowded the dusty departure terminal amid tearful embraces and anxious passengers hoping to get a ticket out. The Bank of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> office was jammed with people changing money, and the snack bar above the lobby was nearly full. Five planes from <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, including two emergency <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> flights and one from ANA, had flown 1,170 passengers to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, said <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Shigekazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>. Another ANA jet was to take a few hundred more Thursday night, he said. `` We were going to leave tomorrow, but the embassy and our company told us to get out as soon as possible,'' said <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishi </PERSON>, an interpreter for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Seibu-Saison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which is setting up a joint venture furniture company. All 30 of the firm's Japanese employees were leaving today, she said. `` I wanted to stay six weeks, but we have to leave after one week because it is getting very dangerous,'' said a 29-year-old Swiss tourist who was taking a <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION> plane sent to take the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> and Austrians to <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. She and other students spent two nights at the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> out of fear of soldiers who constantly cruise <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> streets, pointing their rifles at people and shooting occasionally. `` We slept in the embassy garden,'' said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It was very comfortable. They have a roof, and thick blankets to sleep on.'' <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> Denkmayr </PERSON>, an Austrian studying at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION>, was taking the same flight. `` I do n't want to leave but the Austrian government and <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> say I had better,'' she said. `` If it gets to a critical situation then we ca n't get out.'' The Philippine government sent a commercial airliner to fetch 300 Filipinos after bickering among several government agencies and the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Some <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> dependents had to beg for seats aboard an earlier <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight because the <ORGANIZATION> PAL </ORGANIZATION> jet was held up.

<HEAD>Businesses Plan to Increase Spending on Plants and Equipment by 6.5
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government reported today that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses plan to increase spending on plants and equipment by a solid 6.5 percent in 1989, despite growing evidence that economic growth is slowing. Businesses responding to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey said they expected to spend $ 451.43 billion for expansion and modernization this year. That is up from a record $ 423.69 billion spent on business investment in 1988, the department said. All of the numbers are adjusted for inflation. The survey, completed in May, indicated that businesses have stepped up slightly their capital spending plans since a similar survey completed in March found plans to increase spending by 6.3 percent this year. In an even earlier survey of 1989 business investment plans, conducted last December, companies had estimated their capital spending would increase 5.9 percent this year. The economy grew at a 4.3 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 1989, but growth in the gross national product was a sluggish 1.8 percent discounting a statistical bounceback from last summer's drought. That compares with GNP growth of 3.9 percent for all of 1988. The slower growth is attributed to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s upward pressure on interest rates for 15 months as it attempted to slow the economy to ease inflation. The projected growth in business spending would spell good news for the economy, providing part of the momentum needed to guide it to a slower growth path without sliding into a recession. It also could help stem inflation by boosting production, and thus avoiding shortages and increasing the amount of goods available to American consumers. Capital spending grew 10.1 percent in 1988 as companies rushed to expand production to meet rising export demand. It was the sharpest increase since a 16.6 percent jump in 1984, when businesses were still recovering from the 1981-82 recession. Spending climbed just 2.3 percent in 1987 and dropped 3.9 percent in 1986. In the latest survey, manufacturing companies said they planned a 3.6 percent increase in capital outlays to $ 170.54 billion, compared to 12.8 percent in 1988. This includes a 1.4 percent rise in plants that produce durable goods, items expected to last three years or more, and a 5.7 percent increase in companies producing non-durable goods. Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other non-manufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 8.4 percent to $ 280.89 billion. Before adjusting for inflation, 1989 plant and equipment spending is expected to rise by 9.9 percent to $ 472.08 billion, down from 10.3 percent in 1988.

 Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will help free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tries to win freedom for Iranians held by Christian forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It was the first time a top Iranian leader has commented on the foreign hostages since the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on Saturday. Under <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> supported pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanan </LOCATION> which are believed to be holding most of the 15 foreign hostages, including nine Americans. Responding to a recent appeal by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to help gain the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said that if `` the Americans who have more influence than us on the Phalangists -LRB- right-wing Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB- take action in securing the release of our hostages, then they can expect our help.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was referring to four Iranians who have been missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for nearly seven years. Although the four are widely believed to be dead, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has repeatedly tried to use them as a bargaining chip with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In his other remarks during an unusual news conference with foreign reporters, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said it could take a long time to formally end the Iran-Iraq war and that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> told him to improve relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He also said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> must take the initiative to improve ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. According to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> news reports today, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will not withdraw <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s February order that Moslems seek out and kill the <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of `` The Satanic Verses,'' but `` is prepared to let the matter drop.'' Many Moslems believe the book defames Islam. The four Iranians <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> referred to were seized by right-wing Christians in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1982 during the Israeli invasion. They include <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Motevaselian </PERSON>, commander of the contingent of Iranian revolutionary guards based in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charge </ORGANIZATION> d'Affaires <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhavan </PERSON>, a correspondent for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The fourth was their Lebanese Shiite Moslem driver, <PERSON> Rastegar </PERSON> <PERSON> Moqadam </PERSON>, who also held an Iranian passport. Pro-Iranian groups are believed to be holding 15 foreigners, including nine Americans. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest held of the foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. On the 8 -LCB- - year Iran-Iraq war, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who is acting military commander, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was not willing to make any concessions to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the peace talks The U.N.-sponsored talks stalled soon after they started Aug. 25. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying, `` We are determined to put an end'' to the war. He said the stalement in peace talks may last for some time. At his news conference, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as saying days before he died that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should improve ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said he would visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> later this month but that a date had not been set. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> told him to `` ` try to promote your relations with your big northern neighbor' and we will follow this policy drawn by the imam.'' Iranians refer to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as their imam, or spiritual leader. He died of a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after undergoing surgery for internal bleeding in his intestines. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was addressing foreign correspondents who gathered in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s funeral Tuesday. In his will read to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after his death, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> singled out the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for special criticism, but it also warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> against aligning itself with the communist bloc. On <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with the neighboring Arab states in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said: `` There is no problem on our side'' for improving ties. `` We have received positive signals from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states, except <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>,'' the speaker said. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in April 1988, complaining that it supports terrorism and attempts to destabilize governments in the region. The Arab states backed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the gulf war. Strains developed again with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> after the kingdom announced it was maintaining quotas introduced last year on the number of pilgrims allowed to attend the annual hajj, the pilgrimage to the Moslem holy cities of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. More than 400 people, most of them Iranians, died in clashes between <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> police and demonstraters during the hajj in 1987.

 The race is on for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat left vacant by the death of <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, with early expectations that the Aug. 29 special election will produce the first Cuban-born member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In bilingual news conferences Wednesday, two Cuban-born Republicans, state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> and conservative businessman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, announced they will seek the nomination for the seat held 26 years by Pepper, a liberal Democrat in a district that came to be dominated by conservative Hispanics. Democrats vowed to hold onto the seat and turn the tide of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> victories in the South. `` The perception that we are flat on our backs in the region is false,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area is home to many of the 1 million Cubans who have come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> came to power 30 years ago. Cuban-Americans tend to be more conservative and more ardently anti-communist than other Hispanic-Americans. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> is an educator elected in 1982 to the Legislature. She is married to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a once-destitute immigrant who built a multimillion-dollar banana importing business and raised money for former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, was once hailed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as an example of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. State Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> is the most prominent name in a long list of potential Democratic candidates. He said he will announce his decision by Friday. His opposition to aid to the Nicaraguan Contras angered many Cuban and Nicaraguan exiles. Registration in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 18th district is 54 percent Democrat, down from 72 percent a decade ago. The district ranges from inner-city black areas and retirement enclaves to <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and upscale suburbs. Hispanis make up 40 percent to nearly half of the district. Pepper, who died at age 88 on May 30, was known as the last of the New Deal liberals but took strong anti-communism stands, including support of Contra aid.

 A top <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> commander cast doubt today on whether the East and West can agree to cut conventional forces and weapons within a year as proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It's optimistic, indeed. Unrealistic? I do n't know,'' West German Gen. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> told reporters outside a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers meeting at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. He heads <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s panel of allied commanders He spoke as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> colleagues opened their annual two-day spring session on military strategy. The meeting follows a session at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Wednesday of 12 European defense ministers that ended with a statement welcoming economic and political reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But the ministers also said the Soviet bloc remains more powerful in some military areas and does not appear to have slowed modernization of its forces. In their sessions, the ministers are studying proposals to increase the share of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> funds paid by several nations other than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In his remarks, <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations were such that `` there is a lot of pressure'' from both sides to come to an early agreement. At a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit last week in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be cut to 275,000 on each side and the number of combat planes and helicopters in East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be reduced to 15 percent below <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s current forces. The proposal would mean a European cut in manpower of 30,000 for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to Western estimates, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would have to slash its troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 325,000 to reach the same level. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals, endorsed by all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, will be added to proposals at conventional arms talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Those discussions also cover proposed deep cuts in other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact armaments, including tanks and artillery. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seeking to quicken the pace of the talks that opened early this year, said he hoped an accord on conventional force cuts could be reached within six months to a year with the reductions completed by 1992 or 1993. At his press conference, <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> called that a `` very severe time factor.''

 A mob stormed a police station and tried to seize weapons in the Uzbek republic's <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where ethnic violence has killed 71 people, official media said today. More than 600 people have been injured and more than 400 arrested since the unrest began about two weeks ago in the eastern part of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. Thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers have curbed, but not stopped, arson and murder in the area, 1,500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that in the region's city of <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION>, a crowd of thousands `` stimulated by alcohol and drugs'' stormed a police station Wednesday and tried to take weapons, while another crowd of 600 attacked the transportation department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The attempts to obtain weapons failed, but so did appeals from <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION> government and party leaders for calm, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Six people died and more than 90 were injured; 65 houses and more than 20 cars were set ablaze, it said. `` More houses are burning,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. In the city of <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION>, which has a population of more than 200,000, shootings and arson attempts continued Wednesday night, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported. A dispute between Uzbeks and an ethnic <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority led to `` pogroms, arson, beatings and murder, accompanied by harassment and rape in conjunction with insolent marauding, resistance to police and internal security forces,'' <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'s premier told the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. The premier, <PERSON> Gayrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadyrov </PERSON>, said 141 police officers along with 100 civilians were hospitalized. He said he expected the death toll of 71 to rise as the wounded died and more corpses were found in the ashes of gutted houses. `` Passions are still boiling,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. About 9,000 internal security troops have been brought in to quell the unrest, but <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the government refrained from bringing in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said law enforcement officers and soldiers in the area have been authorized to use weapons for self-defense. An Uzbek grass-roots movement, <LOCATION> Berlik </LOCATION>, appealed today to the Soviet parliament to remedy the miserable living conditions that it said helped give rise to the unrest. `` People in the villages are living on the edge of poverty and subsisting on bread and water because of the monopoly on cotton,'' said the appeal, read over the telephone from <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> by the movement's secretary, <PERSON> Gavkhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Normatova </PERSON>. Activists claim that cotton production quotas imposed on <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have resulted in neglect of food production and ensuing shortages, and has poisoned the enviromment with intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides. `` There are 1.5 million unemployed in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Normatova </PERSON> said. `` The real reason for this unthinkable slaughter is the economic, political and cultural frustration of the people.'' <PERSON> Kadyrov </PERSON> said more than 10,000 members of the Meskhi-Turk minority involved in the unrest have been evacuated to a military training camp. `` I do n't want to oversimplify the situation,'' he said, `` but I have grounds to say we are putting the situation under control.'' The Meskhi Turks were deported from their homeland in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in 1944 by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and forcibly resettled in the Central Asian republic. Officials say the violence began on May 23 during a marketplace dispute between a <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> and an Uzbek fruit vendor. The unrest since has spread from city to city in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> region. Over the weekend, more than 400 houses, 116 cars, eight industrial enterprises and some schools and government offices were destroyed, many by arson, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Uzbeks and <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> are traditionally Moslem. The Turkish minority has been pressing its demands to be allowed to return to its ancestral homeland in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that authorities had the situation in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> under control but that there were still incidents of arson and killings.

 Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> reappeared in public today and praised the the soldiers who crushed the student protests for democracy in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` You have worked hard, comrades,'' he declared. At the same time, the government issued new martial law orders demanding that student leaders surrender. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> gave a rousing speech to hundreds of soldiers inside the Great Hall of the People on the square where thousands demonstrated and where the massacre of hundreds of students took place over the weekend. It was his first appearance in public since May 25. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s speech was shown on television after hundreds of military trucks roared into the city center with new supplies. Busloads of foreigners, fearing new violence, rushed to the airport to catch emergency flights out. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, accompanied by Vice President <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON>, also regarded as a hard-line conservative, was dressed in a Mao suit and looked fit. The martial law orders appeared to suggest the government was planning large-scale arrests of activists who led the movement for a freer and less corrupt <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The capital's streets were relatively calm today. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> is believed to be among the leaders who pushed for the military crackdown that ended in the weekend massacre of hundreds of unarmed civilians as troops cleared Tiananmen Square of pro-democracy protesters. He had not appeared in public since five days after his May 20 declaration of martial law in the capital, and his appearance indicated hardliners may have prevailed over leaders who opposed using troops to quell the protests. The student protesters had demanded <PERSON> Li </PERSON> resign for declaring martial law after weeks of pro-democracy protests, primarily in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The martial law orders called the leaders of independent student and union groups `` important members of the counterrevolutionary turmoil.'' It demanded that all members of the groups, leaders of the pro-democracy movement smashed by the military, turn themselves in to police. Radio and television gave telephone numbers for people to call to report those who stood up against the military takeover of the city. In a continuing propaganda campaign supporting the harsh military actions, national television repeatedly showed footage of crowds attacking soldiers and burning vehicles during the crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday night and Sunday. It showed gruesome shots of three soldiers who were burned to death. One was disembowelled. In his speech to the soldiers, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> urged them `` to continue working hard to protect the capital's safety and order.'' They cheered and applauded. A <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper had reported that he had been shot and wounded in the thigh by a police officer on Sunday after the military took Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of troop trucks rumbled into the city of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> early today, but residents claimed the hated <ORGANIZATION> 27th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which carried out the weekend assault, had left the city, replaced by new troops. Citizens attempted to establish order in their shattered lives under the watchful eyes of martial law troops, and the government issued a new decree making it illegal to put up barricades in the street and disrupt traffic. Last week, the people had pushed buses, trucks and other objects into the streets in futile efforts to stop troops from entering the city. The main concern has been that military units opposing the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement would launch an attack to drive the 27th Army from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Roughly 200,000 troops from about 13 army groups are bunched in and around the city. In buses and caravans, many bearing their countrys' flags, foreigners left for the airport, where chartered flights took them out of the country. They included non-essential personnel at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and their families. `` We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, and the biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pulling them out of town,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> told reporters at the airport. One Asian diplomat said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials in the past few days had been privately urging foreigners to leave the city because of the impending danger. However, troops were seen with brooms today rather than automatic rifles, sweeping the streets south of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, disturbances still wracked many provincial cities. A Chinese source in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, where anti-government violence has been reported, said troops had come into the city but left. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, much of the work force stayed away from jobs because of street barricades set up in anticipation of a military assault. Other cities where protesters had barricaded rail lines and roads and besieged government offices included <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lanzhou </LOCATION>. There was a semblance of normalcy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the first time since the weekend onslaught. Bicyclists were able to pass unimpeded on the south side of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> and catch a glimpse of the huge military encampment there. Armed soldiers lined the streets, but there were no confirmed reports of troops opening fire on crowds, which was common until today. In one incident, soldiers smashed the camera equipment of a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> crew and held a gun to the head of one crewman. The crew, filming near a burned out vehicle near the troops, was released after 30 minutes of questioning at gunpoint. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hard-line leaders, who appeared to gain the upper hand in a behind-the-scenes power struggle last week, issued two harsh edicts Wednesday. One said troops were authorized to `` forcefully dispose of, on the spot'' anyone who resists arrest. The other said any <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who `` plotted, organized and led the rebellion'' during the student protests would be expelled from the party and punished severely. It did not mention any names. A few vehicles ventured onto main streets Wednesday, but gas stations remained closed, public transportation was stopped, mail and newspapers were n't delivered and many stores were closed. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said many people are hoarding food. Long lines formed outside those groceries that were open. People on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s streets said the <ORGANIZATION> 27th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had been replaced in the city center by `` more peaceful'' troops from the 63rd, 68th and 20th armies. Soldiers said to be from the 20th Army group engaged in relaxed conversation with groups of residents just southeast of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proposal for Palestinian elections in the occupied lands topped the agenda when delegations from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> met today. The two sides, in their third session since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government lifted its ban on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, met in a Tunisian government guest house in suburban <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>. It was not known how long the session would last. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and the only <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official authorized to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, intended to discuss the Israeli-proposed elections in the occupied territories, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation was led by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON>, a member of the group's executive committee. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials say they would accept the elections only if they were under international control and after an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> needed to define what it meant by `` an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal.'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> issued a statement today that said Palestinians would accept <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision of an election. `` I ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: why did you agree on an international status for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and you refused such status in our occupied territories?'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops moved into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in April to help supervise the African territory's transition to independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization, has denounced the talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an obstacle to peace. Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Wednesday, called the U.S.-PLO dialogue `` counterproductive'' and said it undercut attempts to win the support of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace proposals. Nearly all Palestinians living in the occupied territories obey <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> instructions, whether or not they are members of the guerrilla organization. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began its dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounced terrorism. As they prepared for the talks, <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and Abd-Rabbou and their advisers sat across from each other at a table and chatted amiably in Arabic while photographers and reporters milled around outside. After a few minutes the reporters and photographers were asked to leave, and the talks began in closed session. At an unofficial meeting on May 18, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaoui </PERSON>, handed <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> a memorandum concerning the proposals put forward by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The plan calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories to elect representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for autonomy. Later talks would determine the final status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is out of the question. Sources say the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> memorandum did not reject the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan outright, but outlined its conditions for elections in the occupied lands. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for its part, has told the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> it wants the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories stopped. It also wants the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to allow Palestinians living in the lands to negotiate with the Israelis, a source said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also reportedly told the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that its continued attempts to send guerrilla groups on raids into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> territory violated its promise to refrain from guerrilla activity. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said recently in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> that `` nothing and nobody can deter the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from attacking its main enemy, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' In his monthly statement to Palestinians in the occupied territories, he told them `` not to let the enemy master'' the uprising and to `` reject the elections intended to create a leadership in replacement of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Two mathematicians have calculated pi to 480 million decimal places, more than doubling the mark set last year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Pi is an infinite string of numbers that is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is roughly equal to 22 divided by seven. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chudnovsky </PERSON>, brothers who are associate research scientists at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, made their calculation using supercomputers, the university said in a statement. Their approach will allow mathematicians to grow the number from its middle or end without having to start at the beginning, the university said. The number they produced, if printed out, would be 600 miles long, the university said. It surpasses a calculation of about 201 million decimal places made last year by a Japanese researcher, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Two Puerto Rican nationalists drew prison terms of up to 15 years today for their part in a $ 7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery after the judge rejected claims they were prosecuted for their political views. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Negron </PERSON>, 45, an auto mechanic, was sentenced to 15 years and fined $ 150,000. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Talavera </PERSON>, a 32-year-old graphic artist, was sentenced to five years and fined $ 50,000. Both were convicted of conspiracy and other charges in the 1983 robbery, the second-largest cash heist in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Prosecutors said members of a militant Puerto Rican separatist group, <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macheteros </ORGANIZATION>, engineered the robbery of a half-ton of money from a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> to finance their activities. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> denounced his trial and that of four other defendants as a `` web of lies.'' Speaking in Spanish through an intepreter, he claimed he was being punished because he refused to abandon the cause of Puerto Rican independence. `` I struggled for the liberty of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` There is no right to rob money,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON>. `` It is a crime throughout the world. No one has been charged because of his political views.'' Neither defendant was accused of actually taking part in the holdup; <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> was convicted of transporting stolen money; <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was convicted of conspiracy. Also awaiting sentencing today was <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 53, a lawyer, who was convicted of conspiracy. The three were convicted April 10 with <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a 39-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> graduate whose sentencing today was postponed a week because his lawyer is out of town. He faces up to 165 years in prison for robbery, conspiracy and transporting stolen money. A fifth defendant was acquitted in April.

Prosecutors have said they plan to introduce no classified material if <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is tried on the consolidated charges. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to try <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> separately on the gratuities charges relating to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, a step <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said would enable a trial in the next month or so. `` You would n't want that,'' the judge said. `` I would love that,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> insisted. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said charges involving <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s alleged lies to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do n't relate to the gratuities counts. The judge said, however, that `` broad discretion'' is `` given to trial courts'' under federal rules that allow consolidation of separate indictments and that there does n't need to be `` mechanical linkage.'' At a previous hearing, Nov. 19 was mentioned by lawyers as a possible starting date for a trial on consolidated indictments. The government is pressing to join the two sets of charges and plans to abandon wide-ranging conspiracy and theft counts accusing <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of being involved in the diversion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms-sales profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Because of the `` limited scope'' of the remaining charges, any effort by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to present classified material in his defense `` will be a claim with very little likelihood of success,'' the government said in court papers filed Wednesday. Identical conspiracy and theft charges against North were dropped because of national security concerns. The government refuses to declassify sensitive material that would have to be presented in court in a trial of those charges. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who became an arms dealer after retiring as an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general, is charged in a March 16, 1988 indictment with offering and paying illegal gratuities to North. In a separate indictment handed up in April, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his alleged profits in the Iran-Contra affair, which the government says were in excess of $ 1 million. North, then a White House aide, enlisted <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to run arms to the Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebels. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> also was accused in the April indictment of lying when he denied that any money from a complex of overseas companies known as the Enterprise benefited North. `` With the requested consolidation ... the government will offer no classified documents as exhibits'' in the prosecution's case, the government said in court papers. It said <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, who moved money in the Iran-Contra affair for <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, will be the principal witness regarding the charges of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lawyer now living in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, will be `` a key witness'' for the government on the gratuities charges, the independent counsel's office said. The gratuities charges involve a $ 13,800 home security system for North and a $ 200,000 fund set aside for the education of his children. North was convicted last month of accepting the security system from Secord, along with falsifying and destroying documents and aiding and abetting in the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He will be sentenced June 23.

 A gesture of good will to high school seniors backfired when Charlotte-Douglas International Airport officials tried to reroute planes so noise would n't interfere with outdoor graduation ceremonies. Wednesday's less than satisfactory results were felt all the way to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We had absolutely the worst of all possible situations,'' said airport Director <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>. `` It was a mess,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> tower chief. The airport changed its takeoff and landing patterns to reduce noise during 9:30 a.m. commencements at Olympic, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> high schools, located near the ends of the airport's three runways But flights already delayed by thunderstorms got even later when the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> airport started its rerouting, and delays quickly spread to some connecting airports as planes were late leaving or had to await a chance to land. `` I know some planes sat on the ground in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for an excessive period,'' <PERSON> Loftin </PERSON> said. That meant some passengers waiting in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> missed connections. `` We heard a lot of complaints from a lot of people today,'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said. Even the commencement ceremonies suffered, because the thunderstorms worsened and controllers had to abandon the plan and send planes out as fast as they could. With thick clouds reflecting the sound, noise from the jets boomed down onto <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> High north of the airport and Olympic to the south. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said one jet flew directly over Olympic, four over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION>. Not by the count of <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, a secretary at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION>. `` I sat out there and counted 13 planes in 45 minutes,'' she said. `` It was horrible.''

<TEXT>
 About two dozen deputies from the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> walked out of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today to protest what they called infringement on their republics' sovereignty. `` Comrades, Comrades, I ask you to be calm because this is not all so simple,'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged the deputies as they left the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s Palace of Congresses. Earlier, a radical economist told the parliament the country should cut aid to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> allies and pay farmers in hard currency to help avert imminent economic collapse. Another deputy said the country was on the brink of ecological disaster. The deputies walked out after they objected to formation of a committee by the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that will decide whether laws conform to the Soviet Constitution. They said the committee could encroach on their republics. The legislatures of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> have proclaimed the right to veto laws approved by the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Our electors ordered us to take care of the sovereignty of our republics,'' said <PERSON> Romas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gudaitis </PERSON>, a writer from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. `` We consider the elections of the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to be without purpose and we will not take part in them.'' Lithuanian deputies, among the most vocal at the session that began on May 25, led the walkout, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It was not immediately clear if other representatives joined them. Soviet TV cameras, in a live broadcast of the sesssion, showed about 25 deputies storming out. Baltic deputies complained that they had not had enough time to study the committee's functions, and said the matter should be postponed until the parliament's fall session. `` The question is so serious let's not hurry,'' said <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gryazin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tartu </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly to form the committee, but 433 deputies opposed this. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he would consult with the deputies who objected and that the issue would be taken up again on Friday. The walkout was the first since the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convened and was the most dramatic sign of opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> establishment that runs the session and nominates committee members and other officials. Earlier today, economist <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> warned that if snowballing inflation, worsening consumer shortages and the `` monstrous budget deficit'' are not halted, `` in two or three years we could face an economic crash.'' <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most prominent reform-minded economists, said Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s economic program underestimates the gravity of the country's crisis. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on Wednesday announced plans for defense cuts and government relief for the nearly 40 million Soviet citizens he said were living below the poverty line. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said the government must do away with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-alcohol campaign and import more than $ 15 billion of goods to ease the country's consumer crisis <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s cutbacks on alcohol sales, introduced two months after he came to power in March 1985, led to massive losses of government revenue and widespread home-distilling. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said the hard currency to pay for imports could come partly from motivating Soviet farmers to work harder by offering rewards in foreign currency. Deputies applauded when he suggested the government tell collective farm chairmen `` if they sell grain and meat to the state above a certain level they will be paid in hard currency with the right of spending it wherever they want.'' The extra crops they produce would be cheaper than the current Soviet practice of buying grain abroad to make up for shortfalls in domestic harvests, he said. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> also called for a cut in aid to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Quoting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> spends $ 6 billion to $ 8 billion on activities there, especially in aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, he said `` no one understands what a significant portion of that money is spent on.'' His speech was in line with the vocal, combative role assumed by some members of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, Soviet lawmakers docilely adopted any measure submitted by <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders. Deputy <PERSON> Alexi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yablokov </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> biologist, said the government should stop issuing economic decrees. `` Our national economy reminds me of a frog,'' he said. `` Every one of its jumps is a decree. Sometimes it jumps straight ahead, sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left depending on what scares it at the moment.'' <PERSON> Yakblovkov </PERSON> also said every third Soviet man will suffer from cancer caused by pollution. He blamed the country's massive ecological problems on loss of local control. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, in his economic program presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would continue trimming defense spending through 1995 and reduce the amount of national income spent on defense by up to 50 percent.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is making his debut in prime-time television tonight with an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> news conference, talked with industry leaders today about the environment and promised new clean-air legislation to `` significantly improve'' the quality of life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conferred with industry officials during the morning and arranged an afternoon session with environmentalists to talk about proposed changes in the 1970 Clean Air Act. At 8 p.m. EDT, he planned to meet with reporters to answer questions. In a speech for Ducks Unlimited, a conservation group, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that on Monday he will unveil `` the most sweeping changes to the Clean Air Act since it was last amended 12 years ago. `` It will allow us to recover and restore precious forests, lakes and streams,'' he said. `` And whether Americans live near factories, in cities or in high woodland country, it will significantly improve every North American's quality of life.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the industry leaders he was still working on his proposal. He promised in February to fix a date certain for reducing smokestack emissions that cause acid rain, which is blamed for killing waterways and forests, particularly in <LOCATION> Northeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference tonight coincides with the start of the evacuation from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of all dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees and non-essential personnel. `` We have urged all other Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to leave at once,'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday.

Tonight's news conference marks <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first question-and-answer session in the stately, chandeliered East Room of the White House. He has met with reporters on numerous occasions in the first 4 -LCB- months of his presidency, but always during the day and never in the formal setting of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>. By scheduling the session in television's prime-time hours, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assures himself of the largest possible audience. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has held 16 to 23 news conferences so far, depending on how you define a news conference. On Monday, for example, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fielded questions for 20 minutes in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing room. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has held question and answer sessions in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. They have ranged in length from a few minutes to about a half hour. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the White House has been looking for an opportunity for the past two months to have a full-blown East Room news conference. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to go ahead now, given the developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and his success at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, where he defused a crisis over short-range nuclear missiles and proposed a cutback in Soviet and American combat troops. Traditionally, presidential news conferences run for a half hour but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may ignore that, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He described his boss as `` a president who has trouble confining himself to 30 minutes.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would open with a prepared statement but likely would not make any announcements, as he did Monday in ending military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not making any special preparations for the news conference, although his Wednesday afternoon schedule was largely clear of appointments. The spokesman said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would meet sometime today with his staff to discuss areas of questions. In another development, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Tetons in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> on Monday after proposing legislation to overhaul the Clean Air Act. The press spokesman said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would stop in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, on the way home Tuesday to deliver a speech on alternative fuels, also part of the environmental package to be unveiled Monday. While at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, the president will visit some of the areas charred from the fires last summer that are now undergoing revegetation, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He will spend the night in a lodge near <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and speak Tuesday morning at the <ORGANIZATION> Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. His clean air proposal, still in the final stages of preparation, is expected to call for tighter standards for emissions that cause acid rain and for more strictly controlling auto exhaust emissions.

 <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhr </PERSON> beat a speeding ticket, but a speed-reading course might have helped her stay out of jail. She said she was held for 15 minutes because she had n't paid a $ 36 fine to the city library.

<HEAD>Commission Urges U.S. and Canada to Bar New Species</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international commission urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Thursday to bar new species of animals from the Great Lakes in an effort to prevent additional harm to the region's delicate ecology `` The integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem requires the maintenance of a balanced yet dynamic natural system,'' the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-Canadian agency, said in a report on the lakes' environment. `` Introduced species can seriously affect the balance and distribution of native species by altering the structure and developmental patterns of their biological communities,'' it added. The report by the commission noted that there have been continuing concerns about outside species in the lakes, the sea lamprey and smelt in particular. However, in recent years, the number of alien species introduced into the lakes has shown a significant increase. Among the outside species that now threaten the lakes' native life forms are the alewife, the coho salmon, the Asiatic clam, the zebra mussel and the river ruffe. The commission encouraged involvement by the coast guards of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in controlling the problem, and recommended that the nations `` take steps to prevent the further introduction, particularly the unplanned introduction, of exotic life forms into the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> ecosystem.'' It was the first time the commission had made such a recommendation, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevacqua </PERSON> of the commission's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. Some of the outside species were introduced for sport fishing. Others made their way into the lakes as hitchhikers on ships or through extending their range from bodies of water outside the lakes region. Although the new species are controlled by predators in their original homes, many lack predators in the lakes, `` and given an adequate food supply and appropriate life-support systems, ... they can become a serious threat if they outcompete or destroy valuable native species,'' the commission said. The report also warned of increasing concentrations of toxic substances in Great Lakes animals, a reversal of declines recorded in the 1970s. Waterbirds on the lakes, however, were producing more offspring, the commission said. `` Populations that were once declining have increased substantially, and reproductive problems in fish-eating birds are generally confined to specific sites,'' the report said. `` Similarly, increasing bald eagle nesting sites are being reported in the basin.'' The report gave no figures on increased toxic-substance concentration or bird reproduction.

 A 59-year-old man who said he was driven mad by his wife's constant playing on an electric organ was convicted of arson for setting their house on fire. `` If you have someone playing the organ 24 hours a day, seven days a week, how would you react? She did n't play it very well, either,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangs </PERSON> said after he was sentenced in <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION> Crown Court on Wednesday to two years on probation. <PERSON> Bangs </PERSON> said his wife's organ playing had destroyed their marriage, and he set fire to their home of 22 years when faced with the prospect of selling it to pay for a divorce. His wife's car also was damaged. The episode has n't stopped his now-divorced wife's musical endeavors, <PERSON> Bangs </PERSON> said. `` She still plays the organ, and so does the man she lives with.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s school system is unconstitutional because of the spending gap between rich and poor districts, and it ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to develop a new setup. The ruling has no immediate effect on the 600,000 students; the court, ruling 5-1 with a seventh justice partly concurring and partly dissenting, gave the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> until the end of its 1990 session to come up with a system to even out spending. `` We do not direct the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to raise taxes. It is their decision how best to achieve efficiency,'' the court said. However, the court said the Legislature _ in what would be a major departure _ must make local tax rates uniform. The ruling was prompted by a lawsuit filed in 1985 by 66 `` property-poor'' districts. They charged that the school-finance system, which depends on property taxes, is not fair in a state where wealth varies widely, from the Appalachian coalfields in eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to the affluent <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> suburbs. Most states have similar setups in which state spending on education is supplemented by revenue raised locally through property taxes. In 1988, a judge agreed with the plaintiffs that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had failed to meet its obligation under the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> to establish an equitable system of public, or common, schools in either spending or quality. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> largely upheld the judge's finding, saying that <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> children, including those who `` by accident of birth and residence'' live in poor areas, are entitled to the same educational opportunities. `` This obligation can not be shifted to local counties and local school districts,'' the court said. Chief Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, writing for the court, said, `` Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s entire system of common schools is unconstitutional,'' including its financing regulations. The court said the Legislature has a chance to launch an `` era of educational opportunity which will ensure a strong economic, cultural and political future.'' Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> lauded the ruling. `` We have the opportunity to rebuild, to redefine education in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. And if we fail, we will have failed ourselves, our fellow Kentuckians and particularly our children,'' he said. Schools Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said today was `` the happiest day of my professional life.'' `` Today the court has propelled us from the 19th century to the 21st,'' he said. Justice <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibson </PERSON>, in a dissent, said the ruling was confusing, over-reaching and destined to spawn worrisome lawsuits.

 Hammers pounded at building sites, table tennis resumed on campuses and soldiers cleaned up the debris. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was calm Thursday, almost normal, but students in the pro-democracy movement say it wo n't last. `` The calm is just superficial,'' said a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, whose students helped lead the seven weeks of demonstrations. `` With so many people killed, there can not be real calm. It's just a matter of time before the movement peaks again.'' The government said nearly 300 people were killed, but Chinese and foreign diplomats estimate as many as 3,000 died when soldiers with tanks and automatic weapons rolled into the city on Saturday and retook <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> from the students occupying it. Soldiers still fired into the air and at some bystanders Thursday, but far less often than before. Dozens of small restaurants and shops reopened because of the relative quiet, along with a few post offices. Banks remained closed. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Evening News were on sale for the first time since Saturday and people formed long lines to buy them. Both were filled with articles denying heavy casualties among civilians and reporting the reopening of businesses. `` There's no news,'' one reader said in disgust. Most residents still stayed away from their jobs. Thousands took bicycle tours of the city, stopping to gape at bullet holes in buildings and bloodstains on walls. Curiosity-seekers clambered over the hulks of tanks burned by citizens. They crowded around hospital morgues, watching families carry out bodies. People walked boldly up to soldiers ringing <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, which has been sealed since Sunday. The troopers politely but firmly refused to answer questions. Residents of the area insisted they were not the same soldiers who stormed the square Saturday night. The evening television news Thursday showed soldiers crouching, using pieces of metal and their hands to clear away ashes and debris. Others hauled the wrecks of buses and tanks off <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main streets, put twisted road dividers back in place and swept the curbs. A dozen troopers walked west along <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main street, trimming tree branches away from telephone lines. Whatever the soldiers did, dozens of curious residents watched and commented. `` If we sit around inside, we get too nervous, so we go out to have a look,'' said a restaurant cook who spent the day cycling around the city, exchanging stories with other residents. Minzu Hotel employees said all their guests had left, but several said they reported for work `` to protect the property.'' There have been no reports of looting. `` Life is normal when we go home. We cook, eat,'' said a woman clerk who sat on a pile of wool rugs in a souvenir shop reading a week-old newspaper. `` I spend the day listening to the radio and worrying,'' said a middle-aged professor strolling near his home. Few students still live on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> campuses, and said they rarely venture out of their dormitories. At <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Normal, some played table tennis while others snacked, read or napped. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ordered Thursday that schools take steps to resume classes, but the word at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Normal </LOCATION> was that too few students and teachers remained. `` We do n't know what to do,'' one student said. `` We are waiting for orders, but our leaders are all gone.'' Rumors have circulated that some student leaders were killed, but an activist in hiding told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> all were alive. `` Maybe new leaders will have to emerge,'' another said. `` The movement has n't ended. Things may be calm for awhile, but the army ca n't stay forever. When it goes, we students will protest again.'' He and others said they still seek the resignations of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and other hard liners who ordered the crackdown. `` I have no regrets,'' one said. `` No one thought things would come to this, but it would not have if the local citizens had n't supported us We students have great responsibility, and maybe we should apologize to the citizens, but they are responsible too.''

 Investigators trying to determine the cause of a <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> crash that killed at least 169 people examined the wreckage of the jetliner in a dense forest today. The DC-8 was approaching the <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Paramaribo </LOCATION>, early Wednesday after a flight from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> when it crashed in the tropical forest about two miles from the airport. Airline officials said the aircraft had been trying to land in heavy fog when it hit trees, crashed and broke apart. The <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported 182 people were aboard. It said 13 people, including three children, survived the crash. Most passengers were Surinamese living in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The dead included the three Americans who were flying the plane. Three of <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s senior military leaders and three top <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> soccer players of Surinamese origin were believed among the victims. The airline identified the cockpit crew as Americans Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Glyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> and engineer <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, all employees of <ORGANIZATION> Surinam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. Further information about them was not immediately available. `` This mishap is simply a national disaster and, justifiably, great grief prevails in our society,'' President <PERSON> Ramsewak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> said in nationwide televised speech Wednesday night. He declared a national week of mourning. It was <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s worst airline accident, and countries from around the world offered to help the small northern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation of 400,000 cope with the tragedy. Government spokesman <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Truidman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was sending a helicopter and a Dutch forensic specialist would assist authorities identify bodies. A five-member team from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was to arrive today to help the <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> government in its investigation. The experts were to analyze the cockpit's flight recorder. Neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was flying in storage facilities because <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> does n't have enough morgues, <PERSON> Truideman </PERSON> said. Those missing and presumed dead included <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s army chief of staff, Maj. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieuw </PERSON> <PERSON> Yen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tai </PERSON>; air force commander Maj. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Djoe </PERSON>, and army chief of operations Capt. <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomons </PERSON>. The airline said its crew of seven flight attendants also died. They were all identified as Surinamers. The <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> news agency said flight PY764 took off late Tuesday from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Schiphol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and crashed at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday near the <LOCATION> Zanderij </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of the capital. <PERSON> Motilal </PERSON> <PERSON> Atta </PERSON> <PERSON> Mungra </PERSON>, the director of <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference that his company had virtually ruled out technical malfunctions because the 20-year-old plane had a maintenance checkup two weeks ago. Still, he suspended all flights of the airlines' other remaining aircraft <PERSON> Mungra </PERSON> said the plane caught fire after hitting a tree and crashing. He said the midsection of the plane landed on its back and debris from the plane was strewn around a radius of 490 feet. Rescue operations were hampered because heavy rains in previous days had turned the area into a near swamp. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, airline spokesman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marapin </PERSON> said the plane crashed after its third attempt to land in `` extremely bad'' weather. <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> gained independence from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in 1975. About 200,000 Surinamese live in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

 Provincial leaders recommended harsh action Thursday against disruption of their cities by demonstrators protesting the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Demonstrations, some violent, have occurred in nearly all major cities since soldiers stormed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last weekend to drive students from Tiananmen Square. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports estimate 3,000 people were killed. `` The present conditions in many enterprises in <LOCATION> Lanzhou </LOCATION> are critical and the situation is grim,'' the official radio in the western city quoted <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> provincial Gov. <PERSON> Jia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhijie </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Jia </PERSON> said `` the dregs of society'' had forcibly occupied `` vital communications lines and important bridges'' and stopped trains. Some students went to factories to force workers to strike and `` forcibly order factory directors to halt production,'' he said. `` It is necessary to form a deterrent force against them and develop a situation whereby, when a rat runs across the street, everybody cries ` Kill it!''' the governor declared. Government leaders in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> broadcast similar news: `` Vast numbers of workers are unable to report to work, and industrial production as well as the citizens lives are being disrupted.'' <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongji </PERSON> later said in a half-hour television broadcast that he could not guarantee the safety of city residents, but did not explain what he meant. He said he had received many requests to call in the army, but added, `` The municipal party committee, the municipal government and I myself have never considered the use of the army.'' About half the work force in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city, remained off the job after days of protest in which crowds paralyzed traffic with street barricades, a Chinese source said. The government leaders said action should be taken to `` resolutely stop the conspiracy of a few people with ulterior motives of disrupting transport and throwing <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> into chaos.'' Soldiers were called into <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> on Wednesday night after days of violence, but were gone Thursday, a Chinese source said. Unconfirmed reports said police shotand killed 20 people crowds stormed a government building Sunday in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. A foreign teacher in <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, a southern city, said several thousand people held a funeral march to the railroad station Thursday, and on Wednesday students visited factories to tell workers about the killing of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Students also went to the workers in the northeast city of <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, a foreign source said. Among them was a woman from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who saw the military attack on Tiananmen Square. The source reported `` heavy rumors of a military presence'' on the city's outskirts. She said <ORGANIZATION> Liaoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students held a large demonstration Thursday.

 A tornado wiped out nearly a square mile of trailers and other buildings here early today, killing at least two people, and twisters destroyed or damaged nearly 100 homes in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, authorities said. The twisters were part of a storm system that also sent tornadoes to numerous other towns overnight and knocked out power throughout southeastern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. No serious injuries were reported 15 miles away in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, where Fire Chief <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spillman </PERSON> said at least four twisters touched down 19 times, destroying or damaging almost 70 mobile homes and 25 to 30 houses. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuschlag </PERSON>, co-owner of an ambulance service, said his ambulances took at least two dozen people from the <ORGANIZATION> Grosse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tete </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION> areas to the hospital. Two people were killed in the <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tete </LOCATION> area, he said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennie </PERSON>, an emergency worker in <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tete </LOCATION>, said 35 to 50 homes were damaged by the twister, which struck after 6 a.m., splintering 75-foot trees and knocking out virtually all electricity, gas and telephone service in the town of 750. `` There's more devastation than I have seen in several years of emergency work,'' said <PERSON> Lennie </PERSON>. `` Trailers have been devastated, nice homes completely devastated. Also homes right in the middle of the path have not been touched.'' Police sealed off the area to non-residents while rescue workers using dogs searched wrecked homes for dead or injured, he said. A chainsaw was used to free a woman trapped in the wreckage of a home, authorities said. Mayor <PERSON> Phillilp </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarullo </PERSON> said the twister struck without warning and cut a wide swath of destruction. `` I'd say in 5 to 7 seconds it was over with,'' he said. <PERSON> Flo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nereaux </PERSON>, manager of a truck stop where police set up a command post, said authorities brought two bodies there and were looking for others. `` It wiped out everything in its path. It's torn a body shop up, torn a lot of trailers up,'' she said. `` We have the police out here right now. They're trying to gather up the bodies. We're trying to get a refrigerated truck to put the bodies in.'' One woman apparently died when her trailer flipped over. Her body was found when a bulldozer righted the home, authorities said. In <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spillman </PERSON> said 400 to 600 people lived in the destroyed or damaged residences. A shelter was set up at a high school for those left homeless. At least six injuries were reported in the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> area, none serious. Two minor injuries were reported near <LOCATION> Amite </LOCATION>.

 Most of the Americans who will greet the 21st century are already alive, a group far different from their ancestors who welcomed the arrival of the 1900s, population analysts said Thursday. During the 20th century, the nation's population has grown to unprecedented numbers, people moved south and west, and there have been major shifts in family life and in the status of women. The 21st century is still about a dozen years away but, from a population perspective, the future is now. `` Over 80 percent of the people who will make up the population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the year 2000 are now alive,'' said a new study by the private <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The elderly of the 21st century are already well into their lifespans and the first high school class of the next century is now in the elementary grades, the independent bureau added in a study released Thursday: `` America in the 21st Century: A Demographic Overview.'' At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> issued its `` Population Profile of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 1989,'' looking at the country's current population status The aging of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is likely the most discussed and documented trend, with 29.8 million elderly in the country as of 1987, 12.2 percent of the population, and two-thirds of the group being women, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency said that this group will continue growing into the next century, jumping to one American in five when the massive post-World War II Baby Boom generation hits senior-citizen status by about the year 2030. That will critically impact health care and retirement income programs, said the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> study. There will be a relative scarcity of young people to take entry-level jobs, school enrollment could shrink and employers will face a different mix of potential workers. Retraining of older workers may become an economic necessity, said the private group, and there may become a need to ease immigration rules to recruit certain skilled people from other countries. The `` traditional'' family of working husband while the wife stays home with the children has disappeared from the scene. Under half of all families have children, and even in families that have offspring the majority of mothers held jobs outside the home as of 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said that `` the growing incidence of divorce and out-of-wedlock births has fueled an enormous increase in single-parent families.'' Currently nearly one in four children lives with only one parent, compared with one in 10 in 1960, the private group said. `` The growing concern over child care, elder care and parental leave will continue well into next century,'' the group added. Rapidly growing black and Hispanic populations have also attracted attention in recent years, with the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reporting that blacks now constitute 12.2 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> while Hispanics make up 8 percent _ meaning that, although there is some overlap, these two groups now include nearly one in five Americans. `` By 2000, nearly one-third of all school-age children will be from minority populations,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported. The decline in birth rates in recent years means that the growth in the labor force will slacken, but an anticipated `` shortage'' of workers in the next century will be one of the types of employees available, not the total number, the private group said. `` Jobs of the future will demand a moderate to high level of education and training, compared with jobs of the past,'' the group added, and business concerns will center on the potential mismatch between worker skills and job requirements.

 A Soviet MiG-29 fighter crashed today while doing a high - performance aerobatic routine at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Air Show The pilot, the lone occupant, ejected from the jet before it exploded. The crash occurred in the middle of the airfield, up to 700 feet away from the nearest spectators, witnesses said. The pilot was taken to a military hospital where he was reported to be in satisfactory condition. No other casualties were reported. The fighter performed flips and turns before making its final pass over <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourget </ORGANIZATION> airfield in preparation for landing when witnesses saw two pieces fall from the aircraft. The jet then plunged to the ground and burst into flames. The air show, which opens to the public on Friday, was attended today by the exhibitors, reporters and invited guests. Fire engines and a water tanker doused the flaming wreckage of the plane. Air show spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON> said of the pilot, `` It seems he had a mechanical problem with the left engine'' as the plane was turning at 1,000 feet. `` When he realized what was happening, showing excellent reflexes, he ejected. But he was too low ... He did n't have time to open his chute.'' Soviet and air show officials said the pilot was taken to a nearby hospital, then to the military hospital at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mande </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The pilot's condition was `` more or less satisfactory and he is able to talk,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Batkov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Batkov </PERSON> identified the pilot as <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON>, 37, and described him as `` one of our best.'' <PERSON> Batkov </PERSON> said this was only the second MiG-29 in history to crash. The cause was not known, he said. `` The specialists must analyze the situation,'' <PERSON> Batkov </PERSON> said. `` When we see the film, we'll know what happened. It is too early to ask questions yet.'' Air show officials said there were no plans to suspend further demonstrations. The most serious crash in the recent history of the biennial air show was in 1973, when a Soviet supersonic Tupolev 144 exploded in flight, killing the six-man crew and seven people in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Goussainville </LOCATION>, where it hit the ground. On Aug. 28, 1988, 70 people died after three Italian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> stunt jets collided at a Ramstein Air Base air show in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. One plane plowed into spectators at the event. Those who witnessed today's crash said the MiG apparently lost a wing or an engine. The two MiG 29s at the air show arrived on Monday as part of a large contingent of Soviet aircraft on display. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a pilot and president of Thermetics, an air show exhibitor, said the twin-engine plane was making a `` very high-performance routine'' which included vertical climbs on engine power alone. `` The pilot was putting it through a very punishing routine,'' he said, adding that the jet might have suffered structural failure. Even before the show opened, Soviet jet fighters were performing aerobatics in the skies above the airport north of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that appeared to astound industry professionals. The MiG-29 was the hit of the <ORGANIZATION> Farnsworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Show held earlier this year in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s All the World's Aircraft 1988-89, the single-seat combat jet has been used since 1985, and replaced MiG-21s and MiG-23s. About 450 MiG-29s are in service and 44 have been delievered to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s. The dogfighter is powered by two turbofan engines and can carry six medium - or close-range air-to-air missiles It can also carry bombs and rockets. On May 20, Soviet air force pilot <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> stole a MiG-29 from an airfield north of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coastal city of <LOCATION> Batumi </LOCATION> and flew to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Turkish officials refused a request by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts to examine the plane before it was returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has recalled 119,000 Mercury Cougars and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thunderbirds </ORGANIZATION>, including a model selected as Motor Trend magazine's Car of the Year, because of brake or rear suspension problems. The automaker Wednesday said it knows of no accidents or injuries because of the problems. Spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said the cars were assembled in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, between October 1988 and March 1989. Five percent to 10 percent of the cars were the Thunderbird SC, or Super Coupe, named Motor Trend's Car of the Year in January. The company said that in a full turn at less than 5 mph, the front suspension of the <ORGANIZATION> Cougars </ORGANIZATION> and Thunderbirds could hit part of the brake mechanism, decreasing the brakes' effectiveness the next time they are applied. Of those recalled, about 11,250 Thunderbirds and <ORGANIZATION> Cougars </ORGANIZATION> made in mid-January also will be checked for a part that could cause the rear suspension to fall apart. The company said 133 rear-suspension knuckles were heated improperly by a supplier, which could result in cracks and failure of the suspension. A suspension knuckle is an arm that attaches the wheel assembly to the frame.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Signals Willingness to Discuss Tax Question with Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, who traditionally has viewed the capital-gains tax preference as the ultimate plaything of the rich, is signaling a change of heart may be on the way _ if the price is right. The price might require President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to back away from his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Even in that unlikely event, some members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> chairs, said Thursday they would be reluctant to accept any such bargain, even as part of a deficit-reduction measure. For the moment, however, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., is indicating a willingness to at least discuss the question with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former committee colleague `` He does n't like a lower tax rate for capital gains,'' an aide to <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> insisted Thursday. `` But could it ever be acceptable? The answer is yes _ if the president offered in return something so attractive to Democrats that they could n't turn it down,'' added the aide, who spoke only on condition he not be identified by name. The aide elaborated on <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s position after the chairman, in separate interviews Wednesday with The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, suggested some kind of capital-gains cut could be acceptable as part of a deficit-reduction plan. The aide said he is not sure <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s position has been changed all that much. Despite a long record of criticizing the capital-gains benefit _ `` I'm not about to tell the wage earners in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that they should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers,'' he said in February, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for the change _ <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> `` never says never,'' the staff member explained. The staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Taxation estimates that 80 percent of the tax cut under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital-gains proposal would go to those with incomes over $ 100,000 a year. Those under $ 50,000 would get 8.6 percent. `` That's traditional Republican economics,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, a Ways and Means member, who said he is not sure the committee is anywhere near a consensus for a capital-gains cut. If the chairman has changed his stance, it apparently is because of the budget deficit. The Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been directed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise $ 5.3 billion in extra revenues for the budget year that begins next Oct. 1. If several expiring tax benefits are to be renewed, the figure will go higher. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed his own package of relatively minor revenue raisers, including higher Social Security taxes on some state and local government workers and renewal of the expiring tax on telephone service. The president also has called for taxing capital gains _ profits from the sale of stock and certain property _ at a lower rate than applies to wages. Unlike most tax cuts, he insists, such a reduction would raise revenue by encouraging more economic activity. A great number of economists do n't buy that argument over the long run, including some who advise <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' experts and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s experts agree that such a rate cut would raise more money in the first year simply by encouraging people to unload some investments they had been holding for a while <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> has discussed the possibility of cutting the capital-gains rate for one year, perhaps two. That would be followed by restoring a higher rate but `` indexing'' capital gains so that in the future, an investor would not be taxed on profits that were caused solely by inflation. Congressional economists say such a plan would cost the government revenues after the first year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, presumably, would be expected to go along with some kind of other tax increase to make up that loss. `` I do n't know if I am prepared to make a tradeoff on capital gains,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, D-Calif., saying it could cause a return to the abusive tax shelters that were all but wiped out by the 1986 tax overhaul `` And a multiyear reduction would mean we would be sacrificing future years' revenues for one year of deficit reduction.'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> also said good tax policy must not be sacrificed. `` We just went through tax reform, where the tax system was so riddled with loopholes for the rich, and we spent a lot of time correcting that national disgrace,'' he said. Wiping out the special capital-gains benefit and the tax shelters it fed is often cited as one of the major plusses of the 1986 overhaul. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> has said on several occasions that restoring the capital-gains break would open the door to junking the new law.

 Two researchers say they have cut themselves a record slice of pi: 480 million decimal places of one of the most famous numbers in mathematics. That exceeds the mark of about 201 million decimal places produced last year in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chudnovsky </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The infinite string of digits begins with 3.14159, and contains no obvious pattern. The newly calculated number would stretch for 600 miles if printed, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Chudnovsky </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, associate research scientists at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, came up with the number after devising a new algorithm, which is a series of mathematical steps. The algorithm lets researchers calculate more and more decimal places for pi by simply adding to an existing string, rather than having to start from scratch, <PERSON> Chudnovsky </PERSON> said. It also has a self-correcting feature that can check whether the pi calculation is on the right track while the calculation is in progress, he said. The researchers checked their calculation by running the algorithm through two supercomputers with different hardware and software, <PERSON> Chudnovsky </PERSON> said. When the results were compared, `` everything perfectly fitted together.'' So what good is knowing this number? `` We can use it as a very stringent test for testing the performance of hardware and software,'' said <PERSON> Chudnovsky </PERSON>, who called pi calculations `` the ultimate stress test.'' And by calculating pi out to great lengths, researchers can investigate whether the string of digits is random or contains some hidden pattern, he said. `` We sort of see more of the tail of the dragon,'' he said. The new work is to be presented next week at a conference on computers and mathematics at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Borwein </PERSON>, associate professor of mathematics at <ORGANIZATION> Dalhousie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said the new work appears to be a record. Tackling the digits of pi `` has become something of a benchmark in computational sophistication,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` It seems like since there have been computers, people have been using them to compute the digits of pi.''

<HEAD>Baker Calls for Soviet Response on NATO Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, saying `` the time is ripe,'' called on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today to respond to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals to slash conventional military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is looking for such a response when the Soviet leader visits <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> next week. At last week's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put forward an elaborate, four-part plan for reducing East-West troop strength and non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We urged the Soviets to reduce unilaterally their short-range nuclear systems to our levels. Next week, General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can sustain this new spirit by answering our call, by announcing a real cut in Soviet SNF -LRB- Short-Range Nuclear -RRB- forces,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The time is ripe for Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to respond positively to the opportunities presented by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s initiatives. Indeed, we look for him to do so when he travels to the <LOCATION> Federal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> next week,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added. The summit meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> had provided a major lift for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had been criticized for failing to respond effectively to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s much-publicized arms control initiatives. The session also eased a major controversy between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was able to smooth over the rift between the allies by agreeing to negotiations on the short-range nuclear weapons, which are primarily based in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and, if used, would probably explode on German soil. Under the compromise, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to enter into the negotiations to achieve a `` partial reduction'' of the weapons once the implementation of the conventional arms agreement was `` under way.'' In the view of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials, that also meant that the short-range weapons would not be eliminated, and would remain in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> arsenal. Under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, the Western alliance would agree to a ceiling of 275,000 on the number of Soviet and American troops on foreign soil. That would amount to a reduction of some 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and 325,000 Soviet troops. Besides his proposals on troop cuts, the president proposed that the scope of the talks be broadened to include aircraft, a longstanding Soviet suggestion. In speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> last Dec. 7, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that by the end of 1990, the Soviets would withdraw six tank divisions from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and reduce Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 50,000. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have insisted that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> retain short-range nuclear missiles in order to offset the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's far larger conventional forces <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has 88 short-range Lance launchers and their 700 nuclear-tipped missiles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has 1,600 short-range launchers.

 He shows them movies. He feeds them popcorn. He takes them on tours of the first family's living quarters. He knows their first names. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s relationship with reporters is n't a honeymoon, it's a courtship _ or maybe a seduction So far in his presidency, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given reporters what they most want: access. But he has n't given them enough of what they want almost as much: news. Before his first big-production, prime-time press conference on Thursday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already was meeting often, usually once a week, with reporters in brief daytime sessions. But because his administration had n't framed its own policies on most issues and because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was cautious in commenting on foreign affairs, what the president had to say did not tend to generate big headlines. `` For a while you had an awful lot of griping, ` Yes, he's a nice guy, he's given us access, but where are the stories?''' commented <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> on Thursday. A senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> studies the relationship between press and government and is the author of `` The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Reporters.'' `` There was almost a slight longing for the bad old days under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, where he did n't see them much or respect them, but he gave them lots of stories,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. That changed with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> last month for a summit with allied leaders and his dramatic proposals for cuts in the standing armies of East and West. As he had promised he eventually would, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> started making presidential-size news. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hand for three decades, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is comfortable with the press. And, a master of detail, he tends to give more complete answers than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls reporters who cover the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by their first names, has some in for off-the-record sessions, sometimes invites a few upstairs for a not-yet-released movie and popcorn and soft drinks. Hardly a week passes that he does n't field their questions. On Monday, when he called a news conference on 15 minutes notice to announce sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, reporter <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> arrived late and asked a question that ended, `` Could you explain what the point of doing that is?'' Chided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` I already did, <PERSON> David </PERSON>. You missed it.'' Then he went on to make his point again. That kind of relaxed relationship is the mark of an expert, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. `` The really good <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> politicians affect an easy-going banter, a light humor, and the one who personified it best was <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>,'' he said. Such politicians, he said, `` know that reporters are very easy to flatter.'' Roosevelt mesmerized the press. He met with reporters in those pre-television days nearly 1,000 times in his 13 years in office. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is following almost all the recommendations of a report last October by the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conferences </ORGANIZATION>, composed of journalists and professors who spent a year studying how to revive a 75-year-old institution. The commission said that under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the press conference had fallen into `` a serious state of disrepair.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> formally met reporters infrequently. He let 5 -LCB- months, during the Iran-Contra affair, slide by without a news conference. The commission's principal proposal: `` frequent, routine and undramatic'' news conferences. The panel said presidents should meet with the media twice a month, and do it during daylight hours `` to reduce the temperature and encourage more substantive and useful exchanges.'' It called for limiting prime-time news conferences to six a year. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said `` the massive news conference'' generally does n't generate much news `` It is n't a very good way to get information out,'' he said. `` It's a way for the people to see a president in action, so it serves him and it serves the egos of the press corps. But there are better ways to make news.''

<HEAD>Japanese Magazine Breaks Precedence with Report on Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The respected magazine Sunday Mainichi broke with Japanese journalism tradition this week by reporting Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> kept a highly paid geisha as his mistress three years ago. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who took office just a week ago, denied the report, but its publication broke a long-held code of silence in the Japanese news media about publishing or broadcasting reports on such liasons by government officials. It is not unusual for Japanese men, especially if they are wealthy, to keep mistresses, while their wives are expected to remain faithful. <PERSON> Shuntaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Torigoe </PERSON>, the magazine's editor in chief, said he published the article because he wanted to bring issues of social ethics into the public arena. `` We also want Americans, who are critical of politicians, to know that in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> we are changing,'' he added. The story generated about 100 telephone calls to the magazine's office in four days Some 80 percent of the callers supported the <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to publish the story, while the rest objected to the story as a violation of Uno's privacy. Sunday Mainichi quoted the woman as saying <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> had paid her 300,000 yen -LRB- $ 2,100 -RRB- a month over a four-month period in 1985. The magazine said it did not identify her by name at her request. It said she was 40 years old. Uno is 66. `` He is not a man of noble character,'' the article quoted the woman as saying. `` I do n't want him to use politics the same way he treated me.'' Geishas are women highly trained in music, dance and making conversation. While they are not prostitutes, some develop intimate relationships with customers who become their patrons. While most major newspapers and television networks avoided the Uno-Geisha story, some of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s sensationalist tabloids compared it to the sex scandal involving Democratic presidential aspirant <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If it happened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> he would have to go,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gendai </ORGANIZATION> said of Uno. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was named prime minister June 2 after a long search for a scandal-free politician to replace the tainted administration of <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned to take responsibility for a massive Recruit bribery scandal. The geisha story is the only blemish so far in Uno's case. He denied the liason with the geisha. `` It's out of the question,'' Uno told the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>. Although the magazine is a Sunday publication it has been on newsstands since Monday. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> has not been asked about the article during question periods in the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament. <PERSON> Kuniko </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoguchi </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Sophia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that in the past 15 years keeping mistresses has come to be considered against the social ethic. `` If you are in a prestigious position in politics or business, you have to be clean both with money and with sex,'' Ms. <PERSON> Inoguchi </PERSON> said. `` It's now part of the general code of conduct.'' But she added that the Recruit scandal, in which a conglomerate allegedly sought to buy favors from politicians and bureaucrats with cut-rate stocks and political donations, may have worn the Japanese down. `` Now that the Recruit scandal has come to an end, people might be a little tired of picking on politicians right now,'' she said. <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, the chairman of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the most powerful woman in politics, refused to comment on the report.

<HEAD>Alaska Senator Criticizes Housing Allowance Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Republican senator lashed out Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> system of providing a housing allowance to military personnel living outside installations, charging that the current policy is unfair to residents of economically-depressed areas. `` I've never seen worse stupidity in my life,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee hearing on military manpower. The object of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' ire was the Variable Housing Allowance, a stipend that military personnel forced to live off base during a three-to-four year stint can use to help defray the cost of housing. The allowance is based on 80 percent of local housing costs and changes annually depending on the housing market. For military personnel with mortgages or extended leases and living in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, two areas hardest hit by problems in the oil industry, the allowance has decreased as housing prices have dropped. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was particularly angered by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s recent decision to distribute $ 77 million in surplus allowances equally among all recipients rather than targeting those who have had their allowance cut. `` This is the most unfair system I've ever seen,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berteau </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for resource management and support, barely getting a word in, said the effect of penalizing those in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is `` the exception rather than the rule.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also criticized the fiscal 1990 budget's proposed level of $ 3.609 billion for stationing military personnel and their dependents overseas, an increase of nearly 10 percent over the $ 3.289 billion earmarked for fiscal 1989. He argued against upgrading housing facilities overseas at the same time the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be closing bases and troops may be reduced if the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance reaches an agreement with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to reduce manpower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. What's more, he said, the number of military dependents is expected to remain constant at about 473,000. But <PERSON> Berteau </PERSON>, responding to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> statement' that many military personnel in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> employee servants, said: `` Those increases are targeted very specifically at a hugh chunk of lower enlisted who do n't have the kind of money that can support their dependents in any manner that you described with servants and maids,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> replied: `` I think it's unreal to put us in a position of closing down production lines for new systems ... and building new quarters overseas.'' <PERSON> Berteau </PERSON> then told the senator that `` many are in very sad shape'' and argued that better facilities are necessary to maintain high morale, attract recruits and keep them in the services. But <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said `` they've been living in these quarters for 10 years and in this very tight budget year you decide to build new ones.''

 Murals at the Capitol depicting the `` Twelve Labors of Hercules,'' which so offended legislators that they were covered with drapes, will be displayed for the summer and then removed, an official said.

The state paid $ 100,000 to have the murals created in 1981, but some lawmakers found them inappropriate for the building or were offended by the murals' nudity.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nugzar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON> has no inhibitions when it comes to questioning Americans about their capitalist lifestyles. Take the time the Soviet reporter, on loan to an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> television station, asked a construction worker if his family was proud of his job as a manual laborer. Or when he asked an uptown mansion owner if she was ashamed of being wealthy. `` Always I go back to the office and they tell me, ` We ca n't believe you asked that,''' <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON> said `` But I am surprised that they are surprised. I ask questions if I want to know, but maybe you would rather not know than maybe embarrass somebody with a question.'' Embarrassed or not, both interview subjects answered the questions about their social status. The laborer said his family indeed was proud of him; the wealthy woman confessed to sometimes feeling shame. <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON>, the first Soviet journalist to work for an American TV station, airs such brash reports three times a week on <ORGANIZATION> WXIA </ORGANIZATION> television. The journalist from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> can find similarities between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture everywhere, even in Memorial Day, which he compared to the Day of Victory celebrated in the Soviet union. `` Yes, we do it in very much the same way,'' he whispered huskily. `` These days remind you we're not rid of wars _ they can still occur. I saw this old veteran, he was crying, sobbing, a hero of war, but he showed the wounds had not healed.'' <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON>, 47, said he hopes such reports during his visit to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will help dispel distrust still inherent in many Soviets and Americans. `` I have a boy, 3 -LCB-, and I want him never to be afraid of anything called American,'' he said. `` I want him to take that as part of his own culture, which is called ` human.''' His reports often center on cultural differences. `` There are so many,'' he said. `` Things you take for granted, like nursing homes. I can never imagine my mother, who's 71, living out of my home even if there was the most luxurious nursing home.'' <ORGANIZATION> WXIA </ORGANIZATION> operations manager <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON>'s reports are unusual because they do not have scripts. Although <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON> speaks fluent English, he had no experience in American news coverage. So <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON>'s producers tape his conversations with Americans and then interview him about what he thought was most interesting in the story. Those taped, edited comments form his stories. In one such story, his conversation with local teen-agers on the differences between Soviet and American high schools touched on the problem of teen pregnancy. `` I asked them why girls were always in a hurry to become women when as soon as they are women they want to be girls again,'' he said. `` They just laughed; they could n't answer that. It shows a problem.'' Usually, though, <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON> can find a good side to many of the problems he discovers in American society. `` Everybody here tries to live in separate houses,'' he said. `` But to do that, they are in debt. This is a credit society _ you are always in debt. `` But maybe that is good,'' he added. `` You know you have to work, and that is good.'' <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON>, who is host of a talk show in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> called `` Roundtable,'' will be in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> until June 23. As part of <ORGANIZATION> WXIA </ORGANIZATION>'s exchange program with <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s sister city, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, reporter <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> earlier this spring Among other things, he filmed a rash of anti-government ethnic riots that broke out while he was there. <PERSON> Otwell </PERSON> said the station tries to air reports <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> made during his trip in conjunction with <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON>'s look at the same topics _ like driving styles. `` The -LRB- Soviet -RRB- driving is bad. <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> would close his eyes; he was scared out of his guts,'' <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON> said. `` But here, the traffic is heavy of course, but it's not dangerous if you do defensive driving.'' One topic <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON> wants to take up before he leaves is American funerals, and the modern cemetery with no tombstones above ground. `` I saw what I call a new American cemetery,'' he said. `` It was a beautiful hillock with beautiful flowers. When I stopped, I saw a big plate in the ground. `` I just stopped and sat there,'' he added. `` This showed the American way of life _ they save the land, save money and make all people equal.''

 Polish voters have rejected Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and 32 other top officials of the communist coalition who ran unopposed in elections, according to official results released today. The results by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> indicated that 33 of the 35 high officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies were rejected in the parliamentary election Sunday. The candidates failed to get the 50 percent of the vote required because many citizens crossed out their names on the ballot. Despite their losses, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and the others will retain their regular government posts. But the victory by Solidarity candidates gives the opposition power to veto legislation and even prevent that veto from being overridden. Only two coalition candidates were were elected: <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Mikolaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON>, who is a communist ally but who has gained a reputation for independence; and communist administrative law judge <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zielinski </PERSON>. The results were released as Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to meet with Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and other officials to discuss how the rejected candidates might be seated in spite of their defeat. Solidarity's candidates won an overwhelming victory in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first democratic parliamentary elections in 40 years. The union led the opposition after it was legalized under a pact with the government. In all, 165 deputies were elected to the 460-member Sejm, or lower house, in the first round: 160 from Solidarity and five from the communist or allied parties. In the new, freely elected 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 92 senators were picked in the first round, all from Solidarity. Besides <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zielinski </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> list, just three party or allied candidates running for 264 contested seats reserved for the party coalition managed to get 50 percent in the first round. The other 261 will be decided in runoffs June 18. By comparison, only one of the Solidarity-backed candidates to the Sejm running for 161 seats reserved for the opposition failed to get more than 50 percent in the first round. Solidarity hopes to win that seat and the eight remaining <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats in the second round. It also says it will back certain sympathetic communist or allied candidates in the runoff to build on its electoral success. Solidarity has indicated it would like to find a compromise to seat the rejected communist officials in keeping with its previous agreement to allow the communists and their allies 65 percent of the Sejm. The union is also worried the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> might lose its importance if top party leaders were absent. In addition to <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, the seven other members of the 17-member Politburo who were on the communist coalition were also rejected. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, was quoted today by a British newspaper, the Independent, as conceding that election results were `` not favorable'' to the communist <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But he was quoted as saying the outcome would not hinder `` the bold historical experiment we have begun'' and calling for further `` dialogue and compromise.'' It was <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s first public comments on the election. He also said the next parliamentary election, set for 1993, should be totally free and that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would have to consider relinquishing power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> if its candidates again lose.

 Three allegedly killed or robbed for radical causes. One was accused of killing a police officer. One was charged with poisoning his estranged wife's drink. They are five <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> fugitives wanted longer than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> List </PERSON>, the church-going accountant authorities say was arrested in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> last week for the 1971 fatal shootings of his wife, mother and three children in <LOCATION> Westfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. As in the List case, investigators are hoping to pry these fugitives from their new lives They follow leads, thicken files, contact colleagues around the world and prepare their cases as proposals for the television show `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' the fugitive showcase that prompted a tip leading to List's arrest. List, who claims he is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, was turned over to the custody of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> authorities today and ordered back in court July 6 for a hearing on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s request for extradition. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> maintains a file of about 100 long-term fugitives, including the 10 most wanted, deemed worthy of special attention. Most of these cases have reached dead ends. `` There becomes a time when you're literally down to publicity,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, northeast supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s fugitive unit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` You've done every kind of record check you can do.'' If such long-term fugitives have anything in common, it's a `` different kind of personality'' that allows them to cut all ties with relatives and their past, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been chasing fugitives for a decade. The oldest case on the books is perhaps most tantalizing for law enforcement officials. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> went to his estranged wife's house one day in 1967 in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, for their son's fifth birthday party. The next day, <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> went to a hospital feeling ill, and died a few days later. Police allege <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> served his wife an orange juice cocktail poisoned with wood alcohol. `` It was an especially horrible death,'' said <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Relin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> was arrested but escaped from a hospital while undergoing psychiatric tests and moved to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, apparently in the early 1970s. He changed his name to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>, married and fathered two children, authorities said. He was under surveillance for 11 years in anticipation of an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Irish authorities said. In 1985, he was arrested but <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s high court overturned the treaty and <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> was freed. <PERSON> Relin </PERSON> said recent reports have placed the 53-year-old former handyman and builder in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Relin </PERSON> now is seeking help from `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted.'' Another case being prepared for the program does not go back as far as the List case, but it is strikingly similar. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 52, a former foreign service officer, is wanted for the 1976 bludgeoning deaths of his wife, mother and three sons at their home in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, an affluent <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, suburb. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, like List, is well remembered in his old community. `` You mention <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bishop </LOCATION> around here to anyone who's a long-time resident _ they'll know,'' said <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON>. The four other fugitives are: _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 39, wanted for the 1969 fatal shooting of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police officer investigating a burglary ring. _ <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, 41, wanted for the 1970 Vietnam War protest bombing of a building housing the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> in Madison. A researcher inside was killed. _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 43, wanted for the 1970 slaying of a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> park police sergeant and the wounding of a patrolman. He was a member of a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, 40, wanted for driving a getaway car in connection with the 1970 robbery of $ 26,585 from a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bank, where a police officer was killed in a burst of gunfire.

<TEXT>
 After 23 years, in which he and his wife-to-be raised eight children and collected 19 grandchildren, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> finally got married. But it was n't easy. The couple, stymied in 1966 by a now defunct <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law prohibiting interracial marriages, were almost delayed again, this time by health problems. But the wedding went on Wednesday, although the setting was not quite what <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> and his bride and longtime companion, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, had planned. The vows were spoken at <LOCATION> Amerson </LOCATION>'s bedside in the coronary intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> had been admitted Tuesday night after complaining of chest pains. A half-dozen hospital staffers looked on as <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> and his bride, both 48, tied the knot in a brief ceremony, standing before a minister beside the bed. The bride, dressed in a pink and white print dress and white jacket, glided into the room on the arm of registered nurse <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersch </PERSON>, who arranged the ceremony and also served as witness. The bride carried a bouquet of pink and white carnations; the groom, who suffered a heart attack two years ago, wore pajamas and was attached to a heart monitor. The Amersons had planned to be married at their home in southeast <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Wednesday, their 23rd anniversary together. The Amersons met in 1965 and began living together a year later. They would have wed then, he said, but <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law prohibited interracial marriages until 1979. So they decided to change her name legally, and she took his. `` We had always wanted a marriage license,'' <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> said. `` So this anniversary I planned to give her a license. I decided to make her legal,'' he chuckled, winking at his bride as they sat on his hospital bed. `` I decided to make an honest woman out of her.'' `` And I decided to make an honest man out of you,'' she replied. `` We wanted it to come through on this day,'' <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> said. `` The Grady employees made our wish come true.''

<TEXT>
 In response to the Chinese crisis, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is beaming television signals to the People's Republic, the first time it has ever taken such a step, the director said Thursday. The signal is going directly to about 2,000 satellite dishes operated largely by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, although there is no way to tell whether the transmission is being watched by the military or passed along other channels, said <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> is receiving the signal `` loud and clear'' on a satellite dish in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, he said. The transmission began Tuesday. The broadcast of news to the military is significant because of reports that units backing the pro-democracy demonstrators may have exchanged fire with units supporting the crackdown. `` We are sending a television signal that is available to every major military installation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. The signal originates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and bounces off satellites over the Indian and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceans </ORGANIZATION>, covering all of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` It makes available to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military information about what is going on in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, information that may not otherwise be available to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military,'' he said. Television and radio sets are not built to receive direct satellite signals. The transmissions must be received by satellite dishes and re-broadcast in a signal accessible to individual receivers, said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcasts radio programs in many languages around the world, including transmissions targeted at communist nations, has never used a television signal before, said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` It seemed like the right thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who made the decision and informed a special <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> task force monitoring events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> is aware of it. No one has objected.'' The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> normally beams eight hours of radio broadcasts daily in Mandarin to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but increased that to 11 hours in response to the student demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` Chinese authorities have said that we have a regular listening audience of 60 million. We believe that we are over 100 million now. We are clearly the most pervasive non-Chinese source of news in the country,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s television image shows a broadcaster reading the news, as the Chinese-language script scrolls across the lower part of the screen. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> has not attempted to broadcast television images of the demonstrations or the aftermath. During the unrest, said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities have tried to jam <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcasts. They have not tried to jam <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s English language broadcasts. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> maintains a bureau with two correspondents in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and uses other Western news services, which have been reporting a different story than the official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> media. `` The Chinese media have been very dishonest about the student demonstrations and the role of the military,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` Chinese media have said there were 300 dead, and that they were mostly soldiers, which is not true. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> says 3,000 people died,'' he said. Some Western sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have estimated the dead at 7,000.

<HEAD>Disputed List Says Indistrial Plants Pose Cancer Risk</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel chairman Thursday distributed federal data identifying 205 industrial plants as increasing cancer risks through release of airborne toxic chemicals. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quickly disputed his interpretations. An <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the information was old and incomplete, and complained it was `` highly irresponsible'' to use it as `` reflective of risks in the real world.'' However, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> environment subcommittee, said that even potentially inaccurate figures should be released because they `` indicate the enormity of the problem'' and represent a `` stunning demonstration of the urgency of the public health threat.'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., said at a news conference that toxic chemicals present a cancer risk near the plants at least a thousand-fold greater than levels accepted by experts The plants on the list, compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, pose at least a 1-in-1 ,000 cancer risk to people getting maximum exposure for a lifetime, while the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> deems a risk of more than 1-in-a-million as unacceptable `` It's public information,'' Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, told the news conference in defending release of the data. `` The public has a right to know,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., combined release of the figures with an announcement that they have introduced legislation to control airborne toxic chemical releases The bill would limit emissions from industrial sources and motor vehicles, attempt to prevent accidental releases, protect the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, which have been seriously damaged by airborne toxic chemicals, and control emissions from small businesses. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> plans to incorporate the legislation into a comprehensive clean air bill that also would address urban pollution and acid rain. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is expected to introduce its own clean air proposals next week, including what <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> described as a `` strong air toxics component.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the data on the individual facilities were complied to develop computer models to compare health risks from one plant to another. `` The figures ... were never used to reflect risks in the real world,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, and `` any suggestion those data are reflective of risks in the real world is an entirely erroneous interpretation ... a highly irresponsible interpretation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said, `` To imply that these estimates depict the real risks of living near one of the plants is not just exaggeration but an outright misuse of data to deliberately alarm people.'' The estimates assume a 70-year lifetime exposure to a chemical at its maximum exposure level at a plant. The figures indicated that 205 facilities posed cancer risks for the most exposed individuals that may exceed 1 in 1,000. Forty-five of these facilities had maximum individual risks of greater than 1 in 100, and one had at least a 1-in-10 risk. The estimates represent evaluations of the maximum individual cancer risk that might arise from the inhalation of a single toxic air pollutant from an individual facility. For example, a risk estimate of 1 in 1,000 means that one person out of 1,000 could be expected to contract cancer from maximum exposure to a single pollutant. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said that because of the potential inaccuracy of the data, he did n't know whether the problems at individual plants should be considered worse than the figures showed or, on the other hand, `` not serious.'' But he said there is a real possibility the problem is worse than indicated because the data were limited. For instance, the information only measures cancer risks, but not other potential hazards such as birth defects, nervous system damage or respiratory disease. The figures also do not reflect the combined cancer risk of different air toxics that might be released by a single plant. Also, only the cancer risk from direct inhalation of air toxics is evaluated, although numerous studies indicate the potential contamination of crops in nearby areas, or accumulation of toxics in the food chain, can exceed the risk from breathing the chemicals. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> did not evaluate some toxics, including benzene and coke oven emissions. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the worst plant on the list was the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> butadiene plant in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neches </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with at least a 1-in-10 risk of cancer. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> labeled the estimate `` totally unsupported by any technical and scientific facts or by employee health records.''

The head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON>, said more talks will be held `` in the near future.'' However, a senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, `` It was more of the same from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' Both Abd-Rabbou and the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, read statements after their meeting Thursday. They contained no major shifts in position, however. `` The major focus of our dialogue today was the concept of elections in the occupied territories to launch a political negotiating process to deal with both transitional arrangements and final status,'' said <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, who also serves as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. He stressed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's view that the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for elections in the occupied territories were `` constructive and workable, deserving of a positive Palestinian response.'' The plan calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories to elect representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for autonomy. Later talks would determine the final status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is out of the question. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which has declared a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, has rejected the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> plan for elections. It says the Israelis must first withdraw from the occupied territories and agree to an international observer force. In his statement Thursday, <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take `` clear and decisive measures to stop the terrorist'' measures taken by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the occupied territories. `` These measures lead to more and more deaths, destruction and deterioration of the condition in which the population has to live,'' he said. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the 18-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule, most in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Twenty-two Israelis also have died. <PERSON> Abd-Rabbou </PERSON> also called for an international conference on bringing peace to the region. In his reaction to the talks Thursday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is the obstacle to free elections. `` So contacts with them make things more difficult. They do n't help,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> `` Talking with them, which gives them a feeling of legitimacy and recognition, only makes the peace process more difficult,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to talk directly to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> last December after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said his group was renouncing terrorism. Thursday's discussions were the third round.

<HEAD>Teen Loses Driver's License for Legally Dropping Out of School</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for a teen-ager who had his driver's license revoked for dropping out of school says the state's anti-truancy law clashes with other state statutes, making the new law unconstitutional `` He dropped out of high school legally because there's a statute that says when you're 16, you can drop out,'' attorney <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> said. `` The -LRB- new -RRB- law is in direct conflict of that. The one law does n't jibe with the other.'' Under an education reform law passed by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Legislature last summer, students under age 18 who miss more than 10 consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences must give up their driving privileges. Proponents of the law, which is aimed at curbing truancy in a state where the dropout rate hovers around 17 percent, point to <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> Vehicle figures that show 100 of the 353 students who lost their license through December returned to school. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>, a 17-year-old ninth-grade dropout, took his case to <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, marking the first time the statute has been challenged in court. He filed a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> DMV </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidiropolis </PERSON> and the agency, seeking to declare the law unconstitutional. A trial was set for June 21. Means, whose 16-year-old wife, <PERSON> Tonya </PERSON>, is pregnant, says he ca n't get a job without driving, and therefore, ca n't provide for his family `` What I'm try to accomplish with the lawsuit is to get his license back so he can function as an adult,'' <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION> attorney, said the agency had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment. Means dropped out of <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> a year ago. In October, Means misplaced his license and requested a new one. The <ORGANIZATION> DMV </ORGANIZATION> would n't agree without the consent of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which refused. On May 30, the license was revoked. A hardship clause exists in the law that allows county board of educations to make some exceptions. However, school officials have said that Means could have worked and still completed his education. `` I think the law is ignorant,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> William </PERSON>. `` It should n't have had to go this far. Hopefully, it will get his license back and get the law declared unconstitutional.'' <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> added that under a 1973 state attorney general's opinion, if a person is married and under the age of 18, the state considers that person to be freed from parental control. `` That has been the law in this state for a long period of time,'' he said. `` It was for the kids who were n't too good in school and who went to work on farms or in the mines.'' However, <PERSON> Del </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Berkeley </LOCATION>, who introduced the legislation in 1988, said his law is designed to keep kids in school and help those who have to work get their educations. `` What I do not want to see is the bill turned into a law that encourages young people to go out and get married so they can quit school and fall into the category of an emancipated youth,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said.

 Much more needs to be done to develop community-based services for the growing number of children with mental health problems, <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said Thursday. Mrs. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, wife of Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said that `` at a time when we have a great deal of education, talent, skills, research ... we have a service delivery system that emphasizes hospitalization In fact, some kids are sent out of state to be hospitalized, because there's a lack of community-based mental health services.'' `` The goal ought to be to keep the child in the family, in the home, in the community, if possible,'' she said. `` So we need a commitment to funding for community-based mental health services that are child-centered.'' She was interviewed during a Capitol Hill conference by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that involves the wives of several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and is chaired by Mrs. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> study reported Wednesday that mental disorder among children is a problem costing society billions of dollars and depriving the nation of productive citizens. The report gave a conservative estimate of 12 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children being mentally disturbed, but it added that the true number could be as high as 22 percent, or about 14 million. At the conference, Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>, director of child psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the committee that carried out the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> study, said it was not `` presumptuous'' to recommend substantial increases for funding of research into mental disorders of children at a time of budget deficits and government program-tightening. Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> called the situation with child mental health `` a problem that urgently needs attention.'' He said that in coping with it, `` inevitably there's this tremendous inertia that society has to get over with.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said that state government agencies across the country need to take a more active role in coordinating the services and funds available for assisting mentally disturbed children.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet MiG-29 fighter crashed during an aerobatic performance Thursday on the opening day of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Air Show, and the pilot was injured after bailing out of the jet. The aircraft was making its final pass over <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourget </ORGANIZATION> airfield north of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after a dramatic demonstration flight when a part of the aircraft appeared to break away. Pieces of the needle-nosed jet burst into flames while the fuselage, in one piece, dropped like a stone in the center of the airfield without injuring any of the thousands of exhibitors, visitors and jouralists on hand for opening day. A water tanker and fire engines rushed to the scene to douse the flames of the burning fuselage. The pilot, 37-year-old <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON>, was airlifted by helicopter to hospital near the airstrip, then transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Begin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in a suburb east of the city. The Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said he was in `` fairly good health.'' <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, flight director of the show, said <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON>'s parachute `` barely opened, but even so it broke the fall of the pilot. Air show spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON> said the pilot suffered serious injuries, including injury to his stomach, but was conscious and talked during the airlift to the military hospital. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> carried a report on the incident and videotape was shown on Soviet TV Thursday night. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Batkov </PERSON>, Soviet department chief for the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON> is `` one of our best pilots.'' No immediate cause was given for the crash. <PERSON> Batkov </PERSON> said it was only the second MiG-29 ever to crash. `` Specialists must analyze the situation,'' <PERSON> Batkov </PERSON> said. `` When we see the film we'll know what happened. It is too early to ask questions yet.'' <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON> said the plane seemed to have `` a mechanical problem with the left engine.'' He said the afterburner of the left engine failed to fire during a low-speed turn at about 1,000 feet. One industry official said the pilot appeared to be pushing the plane to its limits before the crash. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Thermedics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Woburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the plane was making a `` very high performance routine,'' including vertical climbs straight up, solely on engine power without relying on wing lift. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghut </PERSON>, manager of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pavilion </ORGANIZATION>, who witnessed the crash, said the pilot `` apparently lost an engine.'' `` He was about 500 feet in the air. There was a big burst of flames and a lot of smoke,'' <PERSON> Klinghut </PERSON> said. The accident occurred about two hours after President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> inaugurated the world's most prestigious aviation show, which opens to the public on Friday. On display are a large number of Soviet aircraft, including the new space shuttle Buran. The MiG-29, a twin-engine combat aircraft, has been used since 1985 and represents a clear effort by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to close the technology gap with the West. <PERSON> Batkov </PERSON> said it was first displayed last year at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION> air show, where it also was piloted by <PERSON> Kvochur </PERSON>. The worst recent accident at the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION> was in 1973, when a Soviet supersonic Tupolev 144 exploded in flight, killing the six-man crew and seven people in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Goussainville </LOCATION>, where it hit the ground. The last previous accident at the show, held every two years, was in 1977 when an American single-seat twin-engine A-10 passed too low while making a loop and hit the ground. On Aug. 28, 1988, 70 people died after three Italian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> stunt jets collided at a Ramstein Air Base air show in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. One plane plowed into spectators at the event.

<TEXT>
 Pilot error appears the most likely cause of the crash of a Surinamese jetliner that struck a tree and tore to pieces trying to land in thick fog, a government spokesman said Thursday. He said three Americans flying the plane, who all died in Wednesday's crash, gave no radio warning of any problem before the <ORGANIZATION> Surinam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet went down near this capital's international airport. The government-run <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the death toll was expected to reach 177. There were 11 known survivors who were initially taken to a city hospital, but their condition was unclear. The airline gave no figure Thursday for the number of people already known to be dead, saying families must first be notified. Rescue workers were searching Thursday for six bodies still in the wreckage. Six investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Paramaribo </LOCATION> at the request of the Surinamese government to help investigate why the DC-8 crashed. It was leased from an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company to <ORGANIZATION> Surinam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. The cause of the accident was uncertain. However, government spokesman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoon </PERSON> said: `` We think it was pilot error, but we wo n't know for sure until the flight recorder is examined.'' Commercial aircraft carry cockpit recorders that record in-flight conversations and a flight data recorder that registers altitude, wind speed and other data. The crash was the worst air disaster in the history of the former Dutch colony on the northern coast of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The plane was flying from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schoon </PERSON> said the three Americans in the cockpit did not report an emergency but circled the runway twice before asking the control tower for more light on the runway. `` That was the last we heard of them,'' <PERSON> Schoon </PERSON> said. The airline identified the Americans as Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, co-pilot <PERSON> Glyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> and engineer <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>. Their hometowns were unavailable. <PERSON> Motilal </PERSON> <PERSON> Atta </PERSON> <PERSON> Mungra </PERSON>, the airline's director, said the company had virtually ruled out technical problems because the 20-year-old plane had a maintenance check just two weeks ago. He said the plane caught fire after hitting a tree and breaking into pieces. Its mid-section landed upside-down, and debris was strewn over 150 yards. <PERSON> Mungra </PERSON> said there were 188 people aboard. About 60 bodies of identified victims were being flown Thursday, along with three badly burned survivors, to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schoon </PERSON> said. Other bodies were stored for identification in a temporary morgue at the airport. The dead included three high-ranking Surinamese military officers and three <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> soccer players of Surinamese origin. Most passengers were people from <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> living in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

 A teen-ager convicted of vehicular homicide was applauded at his graduation while his victim's mother asked the school board to prohibit felons from receiving diplomas in the future. Parents demonstrated last week at <ORGANIZATION> Santaluces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Norstrom </PERSON> was elected prom king.

 Arab gunmen forced their way into a hospital in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> at dawn Thursday and assassinated a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the squad used a gun with a silencer to kill 55-year-old <PERSON> Taleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamin </PERSON>. He was hospitalized after an attack last week in which he was beaten and stabbed. In a second slaying, a Palestinian suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities was shot in the head by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> attackers. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the victim, 48-year-old <PERSON> Fayel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawalha </PERSON>, was given first aid by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and evacuated by an army helicopter. The army said <PERSON> Fawalha </PERSON> died later at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Also Thursday, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed by a military patrol, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said there were no clashes between troops and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> stone-throwers at the time, and that it was not clear what provoked the shooting. All three shootings occurred in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army spokeswoman confirmed the slayings of the men and said police were investigating. She said officials were checking reports of the boy's death. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> termed the attacks the latest examples of a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` reign of terror'' in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as encouragement to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and an impediment to peace. The PLO-U.S. talks resumed Thursday in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is the obstacle to peace in the region,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` Talking with them gives them a feeling of legitimacy and recognition and makes the peace process more difficult.'' In the fatal attack at <ORGANIZATION> Rafidiyeh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, `` a group of people entered the hospital at 5 a.m.,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinar </PERSON>, the hospital's director. `` They forced a male nurse and a relative to leave the room. Then they opened fire, killing him instantly.'' Another doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Yamin </PERSON> was shot once in the head. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the gang was armed with a gun with a silencer. The slayings of the men brought to 50 the number of Palestinians killed by other Arabs since the uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories began in December 1987. Most have been accused of helping <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities or of drug dealing or prostitution. All three deaths brought to 512 the number of Palestinians killed in the 18-month-old rebellion, most in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Twenty-two Israelis also have died. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers on Thursday sealed the homes of three Palestinians accused of throwing firebombs at troops. A day earlier, the army blew up one house and sealed another belonging to Palestinians suspected in firebomb attacks. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and human rights groups have denounced the practice, saying it violates the right to due process because those punished usually have not been charged or tried. An 18-year-old Palestinian was reported wounded in the leg in a clash with troops in <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which remained under curfew for the fifth consecutive day. The curfew was lifted for two hours Thursday to allow the strip's 700,000 residents to buy food Meanwhile, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to halt all settlement activity in the occupied lands, and suggested that even talking about such plans was harmful to peace. `` These announcements of new settlements are politically problematic even if they do n't go through with it,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in an interview with the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` It's something I wish there was a sensitivity to,'' he said. In an unusually blunt speech last month, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> lashed out at the settlements, saying they were a bar to peace. More than 130 settlements housing about 70,000 Jews have been built in the territories, home to 1.7 million Palestinians. A public opinion survey published Thursday indicated 53 percent of Israelis would object to dismantling the settlements as part of a peace agreement. But 42 percent of the 579 respondents favored their removal. The poll was conducted this week by the <ORGANIZATION> Dahaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and carried in the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> daily. No margin of error for the poll was given.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, permitted to act by the settlement of a partisan dispute within its ranks, sent a $ 2.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday but left some arguments over spending priorities unresolved. The panel also recommended the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirm four pending diplomatic nominations, including that of former Sen.

The <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> controversy temporarily set aside, the committee faced problems involving spending choices that must be made. Under a budget deal reached by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, combined foreign affairs spending for <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> funding and foreign aid was set at $ 19 billion. But the administration requested total spending of nearly $ 19.8 billion.

Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, contended it is important the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> meet its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> obligations, especially when funds are needed for vital international peacekeeping operations. Refusing to pay would brand the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as `` an international deadbeat,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said it was `` vastly more important to build these transmitters than to ship a whole hat full of money up to that crowd at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' Other panel members contended spending for the transmitter project could be slowed because the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has stopped electronic jamming of <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts, jamming that the new transmitters were designed to overcome. In the end, the panel decided not to decide, at least for the moment. By voice vote, it approved full funding for the transmitters. Then it voted not to take the money out of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. It then sent the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for further action at a funding level $ 792 million above the budget ceiling. `` We will have to wrestle this to the ground further down the road,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>. He and other senators expressed hope the administration will set priorities and make choices needed to get foreign affairs spending into balance. The panel also voted to recommend the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approve <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominations of: _ <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> to be assistant secretary of State for Latin American _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to be assistant secretary for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> and South Asian Affairs _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> to be ambassador to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., said he organized the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> boycott because he feared a campaign of `` delays and leaks'' was being mounted to prevent any action on the <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> nomination A committee investigation into <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s background was spurred by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> _ while national security adviser to then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ may have helped in an illegal effort to resupply the Nicaraguan Contra rebels with weapons and ammunition <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> resolved the impasse on Wednesday after administration officials promised to supply documents <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> had requested. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> will hold a second day of under-oath testimony on June 15.

 Syrian gunners shelled the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Thursday as three Arab foreign ministers opened talks in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to try to end three months of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said two civilians were wounded during the sporadic daylong hostilities. Syrian gunners, deployed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, fired more than 100 howitzer shells in an apparent effort to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from receiving arms supplies by sea, police said. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules, said the shells exploded around the Christian ports of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners, entrenched in the 310-square-mile enclave, unleashed a howitzer barrage at sundown aimed at Syrian gun positions in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside district, police reported. `` It's a limited retaliation aimed at the sources of Syrian fire,'' said a communique from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s headquarters. The police spokesman said gun battles broke out at nightfall between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line in the battle-scarred old commercial district straddling the port. The latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war began on March 8. Since then, 363 people have been killed and 1,432 wounded. In the Syrian capital, President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> met with foreign ministers <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Filali </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bouallam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bsayeh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, who delivered a message from their leaders on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has long considered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> within its sphere of influence. <PERSON> Al-Filali </PERSON> said in a statement: `` We hope to find soon a final solution to the Lebanese problem.'' The three nations were chosen at an Arab summit conference in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, to come up with a peace plan within six months to end the civil war. The foreign ministers are to travel later to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for talks with Iraqi officials on the confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 soldiers. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe, had declared support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` war of liberation'' against the Syrians. The current round of fighting began after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> because they deprive the state treasury of about $ 100 million in customs dues annually. Syrian troops and allied militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retaliated by blockading the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave, where about 1 million people live. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> called a cease-fire on May 26 but it has not been honored. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on Wednesday called the confrontation `` a war for sovereignty, nothing more, nothing less.'' His remarks at a military graduation ceremony were published by the independent daily newspaper An-Nahar. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces that control, along with allied militias, a six - to 10-mile buffer zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to prevent guerrilla attacks on northern Israeli settlements <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> troops are stationed across 70 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peace-keeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing in their mandate by siding with Moslems against Christians in the civil war. The leftist daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> As-Safir </ORGANIZATION> said Syrian vice president <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> Wednesday dismissed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as `` not a man of dialogue. ... He does not have a clear-cut political horizon.'' It said <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> made the remarks in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to a delegation from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-controlled northern province of <LOCATION> Akkar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> said Syrian troops were `` prepared to remain in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for another 14 years if need be to achieve justice.'' He was referring to political reforms demanded by Syrian-backed Moslem leaders who have been fighting fellow Christians since 1975 to achieve equality in running <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s affairs.

<TEXT>
 A Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk recovering from 14 years of imprisonment in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said he may have seen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisoners of war at a re-education camp, according to news reports Thursday. <PERSON> Ganshin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, 65, told Japanese reporters there were `` five or six'' prisoners of war who spoke English at the camp where he was held for the last seven years. Vietnamese political prisoners called them Americans, he said. An official of the Vietnamese Embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> called <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>'s remarks groundless `` Our government has repeatedly discussed that issue in the past. There are no more American POWs'' in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> as saying he did not know what the living conditions of the purported POWs were like because they lived in a separate building. But he said they had been treated horribly and had been tortured, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported. The location of the camp was not disclosed. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> said the prisoners were put to work in construction projects, the news agency said. Hospitalized for ailments resulting from his confinement, <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> has been too ill to talk until now, 4 -LCB- months after his return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Televison </ORGANIZATION> said. He is hospitalized in <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION> on Hokkaido, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost island. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Keiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON>, informed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy of her father's comments on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported. An embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the meeting took place but refused to elaborate. The AP was unable to contact Mrs. <PERSON> Takatsuka </PERSON> despite repeated attempts. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON>, formerly a city councilman in <LOCATION> Hokkaido </LOCATION>, became a monk in 1966 and emigrated to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where he set up a temple in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, now called <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> was granted citizenship in 1973 by the former South Vietnamese government. When communist forces took over in 1975, however, he was arrested and detained without trial in re-education camps and jails. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> released <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> on Jan. 20 for humanitarian reasons following appeals by <PERSON> Yoshida </PERSON> and international human rights groups such as <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. A total of 1,730 Americans are still listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>; 634 others are missing in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures.

<TEXT>
 About two dozen Baltic parliamentarians angry about central control of their republics stormed out of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday in a dramatic demonstration that lawmakers are no longer cogs in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> machinery. `` Comrades! Comrades! I ask you to be calm because this is not all so simple,'' an exasperated President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cried as the deputies left the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s Palace of Congresses. It was the first walkout of the raucous <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies session that began May 25 and is scheduled to end Friday, and it underscored the increasingly unpredictable nature of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> politics It also reflected the heated opposition by some deputies to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> establishment that runs the session and nominates committee members and other officials. In other tough talk Thursday, a radical economist said the country should cut aid to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s Latin American allies and pay farmers foreign currency to help avert economic collapse. Another deputy said the country was on the brink of ecological disaster. Soviet television, which broadcast the session live to millions, showed about 25 deputies storming out. The Baltic legislators made the dramatic move after objecting to formation of a committee by the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that will decide whether laws conform to the Soviet Constitution. They said the committee could encroach on their republics' right to self-determination and ability to veto laws passed by the central government. `` Our electors ordered us to take care of the sovereignty of our republics,'' said <PERSON> Romas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gudaitis </PERSON>, a writer and deputy from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. `` We consider the elections of the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to be without purpose and we will not take part in them.'' <PERSON> Gudaitis </PERSON> called the committee a remnant of the `` Stalin empire'' and part of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s attempts to `` control and oppress national problems by an iron glove.'' Lithuanian deputies, among the most vocal at the parliamentary session, led the walkout, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said representatives of the two other Baltic republics, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, also objected to the committee. But it was not immediately clear if they joined the Lithuanian walkout. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly to form the committee on Thursday, but 433 deputies were against and 61 abstained, including <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s delegation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he would consult with the deputies who objected and that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would vote on the committee membership Friday morning. The Baltic representatives contend the Soviet takeover of their nations in 1940 went against the people's will and believe Moscow-based ministries have ruined their environment and economy. Many Baltic residents are demanding autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in all but defense and security. In a direct clash with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, the legislatures of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> have proclaimed the right to veto laws approved by the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Later Thursday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters to leave the hall and asked that TV cameras be turned off. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> then went into its first closed session, its topic undisclosed. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Yastrebov </PERSON>, a deputy from the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview the closed session involved discussion of violence in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. At least 71 people have been killed in a five-day rampage involving ethnic Uzbeks and the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority in the southern Soviet republic. More than 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops have been sent in and a curfew was imposed. <PERSON> Yastrebov </PERSON> said the deputies were asked whether they believe `` more decisive measures'' are needed to end the unrest but that a decision was postponed until Friday. He said he could not spell out what other measures the deputies could approve. In earlier debate, economist <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s call on Wednesday for extensive defense cuts and government relief for almost 40 million Soviets living in poverty will fall far short of solving the country's woes. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said Soviet farmers should be motivated to work harder by offering them pay in foreign currency with which they could buy hard-to-get goods. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> also called for a cut in aid to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Quoting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> spends between $ 6 and $ 8 billion on activities there, especially in aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, he said `` no one understands what a significant portion of that money is spent on.''

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declared <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s system of public schooling unconstitutional Thursday and ordered the legislature to reinvent it By permitting a wide gap between poor and wealthier school districts, the legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty, the court ruled. `` Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s entire system of common schools is unconstitutional,'' Chief Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> wrote for the court's five-member majority. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and poor alike `` must be given the same opportunity and access to an adequate education,'' the court ruled in a case brought four years ago by a coalition of 66 `` property poor'' districts. The decision `` applies to the entire sweep of the system _ all its parts and parcels,'' including laws and regulations `` creating, implementing and financing the system,'' the opinion said. They included laws creating local school districts and school boards, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, school construction and maintenance, teacher certification _ `` the whole gamut of the common school system in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' the opinion said. Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, a longtime critic of the state's school-management scheme, said the court had given <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> its greatest opportunity of the last century `` We've been talking about changing the management culture within the system,'' <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said in a news conference. `` We never imagined that we'd have an opportunity to remake the entire system.'' State schools Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> called it `` the happiest day of my professional life.'' The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s ranking members _ <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Eck'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandford </PERSON> _ said building the kind of education system the court required was sure to be expensive, but they were willing. Rose and <PERSON> Blandford </PERSON> also said the ruling was something of a relief, although they technically were on the losing side. `` As far as I'm concerned, there are no more sacred cows'' in education, <PERSON> Blandford </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> lawsuit was one of several pending in state courts around the country. One such suit is pending in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and another in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is scheduled for arguments in that state's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in September. The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> court agreed with plaintiff districts that despite existing programs to funnel state money to local districts, `` there are wide variations in financial resources ... which result in unequal educational opportunities throughout <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>' opinion said `` Even a total elimination of all mismanagement and waste in local school districts would not correct the situation as it now exists,'' the opinion said. The constitution `` places an absolute duty on the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to re-create, re-establish a new system of common schools,'' the opinion said, likening the present system to `` a crumbling schoolhouse which must be redesigned and revitalized for efficient use.'' The legislature must provide for adequate funding of schools and can choose its own method, the court said. But if lawmakers decide to continue basing the system on property taxes, they must ensure full valuation of property and uniformity of tax rates, the court said. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> law has always required full valuation of property. Local school boards, which now number 177, have been allowed to set their own tax rates, however, and they varied widely. Spending per pupil in 1987-88 ranged from a high of $ 4,094 in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, an affluent suburb of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, to a low of $ 1,986 in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, a small Appalachian town in southeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, according to figures from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> ranks 39th nationwide in per pupil spending, with state and local funds averaging $ 2,574, the department said. The court ordered the effective date of its ruling delayed until the end of the next legislative session, which is to begin in January. Justice <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibson </PERSON>, one of two dissenting justices, said local school districts have no legal authority to sue the legislature. <PERSON> Leibson </PERSON> also predicted mass confusion over the court's apparent invalidation of decades of education law

 The federal judge who presided over the break-up of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will handle the Iran-Contra case of former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> was given the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case in a two-paragraph order signed by Chief Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who has been handling pre-trial proceedings involving <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said in the order that he was handing the matter over to <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> because `` the case will be protracted and complex.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> also is handling pre-trial hearings in the Iran-Contra case of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who asked <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> in a court session Thursday not to consolidate a dozen criminal charges against him contained in two separate indictments. Assigning the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case to another judge is aimed at `` expeditious and efficient dispostion of the court's business,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has said it would be impossible for him to handle trials involving both <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is charged in the Iran-Contra scandal with conspiracy, theft, wire fraud, two counts of obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and making false statements to two congressional committees. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, 66, has been handling the antitrust case involving the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsequent breakup since 1978, the year <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on combating racial discrimination. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> signed the two-paragraph order last Friday assigning the case to <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. Due to a clerical oversight, copies of the order were n't made available to the public. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said at a hearing that he will rule Friday whether to combine criminal charges that accuse <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up personal profits in the Iran-Contra affair with 1988 allegations that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> slipped illegal gifts to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s attorney, argued against bringing the two sets of charges together. He said one of nine counts brought in April, obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is `` incredibly broad'' and will result in a lengthy battle over the use of classified material. Prosecutors have said they plan to introduce no classified material if <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is tried on the consolidated charges. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyer urged <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to try <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> separately on the gratuities charges relating to <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a step the lawyer said would enable a trial in the next month or so. At a previous hearing, Nov. 19 was mentioned by lawyers as a possible starting date for a trial on consolidated indictments involving <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyer said charges involving the alleged lies to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do n't relate to the counts involving illegal gratuities to North. The judge said, however, that `` broad discretion'' is `` given to trial courts'' under federal rules allowing consolidation of separate indictments and that there does n't need to be `` mechanical linkage.'' The gratuities charges involve a $ 13,800 home security system for North and a $ 200,000 fund set aside for the education of his children. North was convicted last month of accepting the security system from Secord, along with falsifying and destroying documents and aiding and abetting in an obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He will be sentenced June 23. North, then a White House aide, enlisted <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to run arms to the Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebels. The government is pressing to join the two sets of charges and plans to abandon wide-ranging conspiracy and theft counts accusing <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of being involved in the diversion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms-sales profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Identical conspiracy and theft charges against North were dropped because of national security concerns. The government refused to declassify sensitive material that would have had to be presented in court in a trial of those charges.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> promised Thursday his embassy will get all Americans who want to leave out of the Chinese capital. `` Starting from June 3, we were running very high risks staying here,'' he told a news conference at the airport. `` We've been planning since June 3 to move people out.'' `` We will be able to handle the Americans leaving,'' <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said. `` One way or another we can do it, I can assure you.'' Chinese soldiers were ordered into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s central Tiananmen Square on Saturday to crush a student-led movement for increased democracy and an end to corruption. The government says nearly 300 people were killed, but <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> and foreign diplomats say up to 3,000 died. Soldiers roamed the streets for days, shooting at random. Some Americans have complained that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission was unresponsive to the need for evacuation. `` They were not very helpful,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a student at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Teacher's College who called the embassy for a ride to the airport. `` They were very disorganized. Those people are so exasperatingly noncommittal.'' She eventually got a ride in a van sent by the West German Embassy. `` I asked the embassy to come and get me, but they would n't,'' said <PERSON> Terese </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who was teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They said I'd have to get to the airport myself,'' Miss <PERSON> James </PERSON> said after she arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` We've helped thousands and hundreds of Americans to get out of here, we've been out to the universities again and again to bring them in,'' <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> said. `` They went through barricades, we got machine-gunned in our apartments yesterday, it's a very dicey situation,'' he said. He said there were contingency plans to evacuate people from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> if escape via <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> proved impossible. `` We're not comfortable,'' <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> said. `` Security is not a finite thing. We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, and the biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pulling them out of town.'' <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> said that, `` With the troops in town, with the shooting going on, with your apartments being raked, surrounded, it's just not a wise thing to keep people here at this point.'' Chinese soldiers sprayed a diplomatic residential compound with bullets Wednesday. <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> noted that Thursday was relatively quiet compared to the previous four days, but said, `` We are n't hearing shots, but can you tell me we wo n't hear them tonight? Can you tell me this thing wo n't get unstuck tomorrow?'' He said he was relieved that no Americans had been killed in the violence.

<TEXT>
 Members of a special <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee told <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> on Thursday to take aggressive action at his department to improve what they said were deficient programs for Indians. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said he would. Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, said he was worried that shortcomings discovered by the special unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs would go uncorrected. <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, whose department oversees nearly all federal programs for Indians, `` Someone has to do something ... shake them up. Someone has to say it is no longer going to be like it was.'' The special committee, chaired by Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., has asked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint a staff member at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> whose only responsiblity would be to make sure federal responsibilities to American Indians are met <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> objected to that, saying the responsibility belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and he saw no need for an outside coordinator. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> responded by saying it might be easier to get action if someone at the White House were helping. During investigative work covering most of a year and weeks of hearings spanning six months, the committee has uncovered what members consider gross mismanagement in numerous federal agencies dealing with Indian interests. As an example, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> reminded <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> that in just a few months, investigators working for the committee exposed millions of dollars in thefts of Indian oil which the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> was supposed to be protecting. He asked <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> what he would do about it? `` We'll do what Sen. <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> suggested. We'll do some kicking around,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. The committee hearings, which began in January, also have revealed evidence of: _ Corruption in contracting for federal projects on Indian reservations _ Child abuse in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools _ Organized crime involvement in legal Indian gambling operations _ Poor management at the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ Failure by the government to protect land granted Indians by treaty from encroachment by non-Indians _ Federal projects for non-Indians that have depleted resources such as water on reservations _ Corruption among some tribal leaders <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said the committee will have a report on its findings by September or October. `` I have concluded that the secretary of interior and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are not meeting the trust responsibility,'' he said. He praised <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> for being sensitive to the problem. `` But you need to translate it into action,'' he said. `` The report we are going to issue is not going to be extremely complimentary. It is going to single out areas where the trust responsibility was not met.'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said the department was already starting to make changes based on findings of the committee.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed the conviction of a death row inmate Thursday and ordered his fourth trial in the murders of three adults and two children. In a 4-3 ruling, the court said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserved another trial because the prosecutor in his third trial improperly questioned him about his conviction in the first trial. The first verdict was overturned because his defense attorney was taking medication for a head injury during the trial. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s second trial ended in mistrial <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was convicted in his latest trial of killing <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, 25; his wife <PERSON> Edna </PERSON>, 21; <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON>, 26; and <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> in March 1981. Their bodies were found in the charred hulk of an car on a remote stretch of road. The three adults died of shotgun wounds. <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON>, 14 months, Mrs. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s sons, died of smoke inhalation. The killings occurred after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s estranged wife, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, quarreled with him and left home to live with the victims. `` The prejudicial effect upon a jury of testimony that a defendant has been previously convicted of the crimes for which he is now on trial is so damaging that it can not be said beyond a reasonable doubt that a jury would return a verdict of guilty absent the testimony,'' the court's majority opinion said. But Justice <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> argued that the cross-examination remark was `` harmless error.'' `` Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the jury was already aware that this was not <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s first trial,'' <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said in his dissenting opinion.

 Parliament speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> on Thursday denied reports of a power struggle after the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also said the post-Khomeini regime in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will not help free Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> releases frozen Iranian assets and helps locate four missing Iranians. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also signaled his intention of playing a bigger political role, telling foreign reporters during a news conference that he wants more executive power for the presidency. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 55, is the only candidate running in the Aug. 18 presidential election. He is considered a moderate who seeks to end the country's international isolation and boost private enterprise in opposition to radical hardliners who favor a self-reliant fundamentalist <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who is also acting commander in chief of the armed forces, dismissed reports that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was plunged into turmoil by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death as `` nothing but shooting in the dark by people who know nothing about the internal situation in our country.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> stressed that President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s appointment to succeed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as supreme leader was permanent. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 86, died Saturday of a heart attack, 11 days after undergoing surgery for internal bleeding. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, 49, was named his successor on Sunday amid speculation he would serve as a caretaker leader until constitutional reforms ordered by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> are approved in a referendum to be held simultaneously with the presidential election. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, considered a moderate and a <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> ally, has served as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s head of state since 1981. He is barred by the constitution from running for a third four-year term. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said the constitutional reforms will reinforce the new president's executive power at the expense of the prime minister. That will prevent rival power centers from stalling the decision-making process, which has often happened in the past. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> claimed that Western countries and not <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were responsible for the country's isolation, saying `` the West should give up its former spirit that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is a satellite belonging to them.'' He said the country will remain faithful to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s policy of `` neither East nor West,'' but added that relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had improved and that he plans to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> shortly. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main arms supplier during the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> which ended with a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in August. `` If the Westerners change their policy and treat us as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did, they will see the same position on our part,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said, speaking <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> through an interpreter. But he charged that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> follow hostile policies toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> ... The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> practically entered the war against us.'' Asked about an appeal by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for help in freeing American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must use its influence on the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> militia believed to have kidnapped four Iranian government employees. `` Then you can expect us to do what we can for the release of the other hostages, although we have no responsibility in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' There are 15 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans, who are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. The four Iranians, last seen at a Lebanese Forces checkpoint north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1982, are believed to be dead. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with information on Iranians held by Christian forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. He reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should help bring about the immediate and safe release of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could not help on the hostage issue while Iranian assets are frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has acted like a pirate ... If the Iranian assets are released as a sign of goodwill, we in return will do whatever we can,'' he added. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, froze billions of dollars in Iranian assets in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks and impounded military equipment ordered by deposed <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> after radicals seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and held 52 Americans hostage in 1979. Commenting on the break in relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' by British novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said the issue had been `` created by the West.'' `` You allowed the book to be published despite warnings,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Feb. 14 religious ruling condemning <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to death for blaspheming Islam in the book was decreed by Islamic law and could not be evaded.

<HEAD>Study Says Operators Don't Discriminate in Programming Picks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cable TV industry Thursday issued a study showing that cable companies having a financial interest in program services do n't try to keep their viewers from watching networks that the operators do n't own a share of. Nor does the study, by <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, show that such cable companies refuse to license their program services to competing deliverers such as microwave operators and backyard satellite dish owners. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s study disputed assertions that giant cable operators such as <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- use their size to discriminate against program networks they do not own. He said that although these companies are more inclined to carry the program services in which they have a stake, they also are more likely than other cable operators to carry programming in which they have no investment. More importantly to cable TV viewers, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said, cable operators' willingness to invest in programming networks, a practice known as `` vertical integration,'' has led to `` an increased variety of programming choices not previously available to television consumers.'' `` As this landmark report illustrates, cable's investment in programming has enabled our industry to offer consumers a new and better type of television,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> released the report less than a week before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee was scheduled to begin hearings on increased concentration of media ownership. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, has proposed that no single company may own cable systems that reach more than 25 percent of the nation's cable households, similar to federal regulations on over-the-air broadcasters. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> studied 400 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cable systems of varying sizes and markets and found that vertically integrated multiple-system operators `` are somewhat more likely to carry networks in which they have an ownership interest.'' However, he said this effect is generally small because the vertically integrated companies have ownership interests in relatively few networks compared to the 40, 50 or even 120 channels they may carry.

 A vaccine developed by polio pioneer <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> may help wipe out the AIDS virus in people already infected and stop them from getting the deadly disease, according to preliminary research presented Thursday. `` It is becoming clear that a diagnosis of HIV positivity need not be regarded as a death sentence,'' <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Salk </PERSON>'s approach is one of several newly reported developments that experts say raises hopes that an AIDS vaccine is possible, if still far away. If the vaccine works as <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> hopes, it will stimulate the body to hunt down its own blood cells that carry HIV, the AIDS virus. Such cells are virus-making factories inside the body, and wiping them out could hold the virus in check, preventing it from spreading and causing AIDS. Whether the vaccine will actually work this way is still unclear. Although it has been tested in people, the best evidence of its potential power comes from experiments on chimpanzees, the only animal besides people that can be infected with the AIDS virus. Experts caution that much more work will be necessary in both animals and people before anyone knows whether the vaccine will save lives. However, Dr. <PERSON> Dani </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolognesi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS vaccine researcher, said the new work is promising, in part because it suggests that an effective vaccine can be made for treatment after AIDS infection _ something many experts had doubted. `` This suggests it is possible to deal with the virus in already-infected individuals,'' he said. While cautioning that this and other animal studies need to be confirmed, he added, `` They are the beginnings, I believe, of piercing the armor that has existed that it would be impossible to protect against this class of virus.'' The latest vaccine studies were described at the week-long 5th International Conference on AIDS. <PERSON> Salk </PERSON>'s animal studies, conducted with Dr. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, were performed on three chimps. Two of them had already been infected with HIV when they received the vaccine. After three injections, all measurable signs of the virus disappeared. And when scientists gave them more virus, they did not become reinfected. The other chimp was given virus for the first time after vaccination. While this animal got infected, the level of virus in its body has been steadily dropping instead of rising, as usually happens. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> described these results as `` very startling'' and said, `` We do n't want to raise false hopes. But these studies are increasing our understanding about what is necessary for a vaccine for HIV-infected human beings.'' <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> said that creating an AIDS vaccine is much more difficult than a polio vaccine, which he developed in the 1950s. And while he would not predict when an AIDS vaccine might be available, he commented, `` There is light at the other end of the tunnel. We hope to move in that direction as quickly as possible.'' In human studies conducted with Dr. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, the vaccine was given in November 1987 to 19 people with pre-AIDS disease. She said they have not progressed to AIDS, and skin tests suggest the vaccine has stimulated their bodies to produce microbe-fighting blood cells against the virus. However, there is no clear evidence that the level of virus in their bodies has fallen. The AIDS virus kills by attacking the body's immune defenses. <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> said he hopes the vaccine will produce more dramatic results when given to infected people whose immune systems are still healthy. <PERSON> Salk </PERSON>'s vaccine is made from AIDS viruses that have been killed and stripped of their outer coats. `` If this holds up in man, it could be of substantial importance,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. But he cautioned against giving killed viruses to uninfected people, because live viruses might slip through. Other researchers are testing similar vaccines against SIV, an AIDS-like virus that kills monkeys. Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reported that a killed vaccine kept two of five monkeys from becoming infected with SIV. Another team from the biotechnology firm <ORGANIZATION> Repligen </ORGANIZATION> said they had found the precise spot on the outside of the virus that stimulates the body to produce killing antibodies. This small fragment might serve as an AIDS vaccine.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Said to Request Large Number of Documents</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee reviewing the controversial nomination of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division has asked him to provide some 200,000 pages of documents, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday. A committee source denied that that many documents were requested. The spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, declined to criticize the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for last week's demand by its staff, saying only that the amount of paperwork requested was `` unusual.'' `` It seems to me it would take years for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff to review all this material,'' he said. However, a committee source said, `` We have not asked for something broad, but for something pretty narrow ... but apparently the way the records are kept, they're in a much broader category.'' The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity said some documents `` may involve privacy matters and we do n't even want to look at the stuff, much less sort through it.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> questioned <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., about the request Wednesday night when <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` He said something like, ` They're asking for a lot of stuff,''' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> to schedule <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' confirmation hearings as soon as possible, and the senator said he hoped they could be held before the July 4 holiday. The committee source declined to reveal what kinds of documents the committee is seeking `` because we do n't to be unfair to the nominee by raising unfair implications about what we're looking at.'' But <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the committee wanted such things as employment records and court documents `` on cases that may have been filed in which he, as a public official, may have been a defendant.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who is working for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a $ 284-a-day consultant while awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, seems `` somewhat amazed by the request'' for the documents, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The nominee did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who had been in private legal practice in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for two years before being nominated for the assistant attorney general's post by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in April, had served as sheriff and chief executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> A black Republican who ran unsuccessfully for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> governor in 1986, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> had been a lifelong Democrat before joining the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination is opposed by some civil rights groups on the grounds he lacks legal experience, particularly in civil rights. On his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> questionnaire, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said he has never tried a case in court since he entered private legal practice in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> two years ago. In one notable case, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was found legally responsible for injuries suffered by a prisoner who was beaten while in the custody of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriffs' deputies. The 1976 beating of <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> by an unidentified person who was admitted to his locked holding cell was the subject of a strongly worded 1985 ruling by the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The court cited <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' `` failure to provide a trained and disciplined county law enforcement agency'' or to investigate the beating incident. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> had testified that he did not know about the incident and therefore would not have been able to investigate it. But the appellate court said he remained legally liable and that his failure to order and direct an investigation and to punish those responsible `` served to confirm the existence of an unstated ` policy' of toleration of illegal brutality toward any county prisoner who had threatened the life of a sheriff's deputy.''

<HEAD>Fixed-Rate Average Down; Variable-Rate Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages dropped in early May after two straight monthly hikes, but those on adjustable-rate mortgages continued climbing for the seventh consecutive month, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said fixed rates fell 0.09 percentage point to 11.50 percent. The April fixed rate of 11.59 had been the highest since December 1985, when rates averaged 12.01 percent. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages rose 0.14 percentage point to 10.29 percent in early May, the highest since December 1985, when rates averaged 10.39 percent, the bank board said. The drop in the fixed rate reflected an easing of other long-term interest rates, the bank board said. Interest rates overall began falling recently after being propped up by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> for 15 months to stem inflation. `` The increase in the ARM rate was caused primarily by a decrease in the number of institutions offering first-year, below-market, ` teaser' rates on these types of loans,'' according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, the bank board's chief economist. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said because of the higher rates for adjustable-rate mortgages, `` the ARMS portion of all loans closed declined to 53 percent in early May, down from 55 percent in the previous month and the smallest in a year.'' Last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, reported fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.48 percent last week, down from 10.50 percent a week earlier. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 9.21 percent, up from 9.18 percent the week before. The Freddie Mac figures are lower than those reported by the bank board because they do not include add-on fees, known as points, often paid by borrowers.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, responding to complaints about high-handed American negotiating tactics, said Thursday that the administration's decision to target trade barriers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was not meant to be an exercise in `` mindless name-calling.'' <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said she was optimistic that the administration's decision would result in successful negotiations despite howls of protest from the targeted countries. The administration, implementing the most controversial section of the 1988 trade law, cited the three nations last month for serious fair-trade violations with the threat that they could face 100 percent retaliatory tariffs if the countries do not agree to remove the offending barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> action was criticized at an international meeting last week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, with the 24-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> attacking such unilateral trade actions. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, who attended the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting, defended the administration against complaints from other countries that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was threatening to set off a global trade war of retaliation and counter-retaliation. In testimony Thursday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on trade, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said, `` We do not seek mindless name-calling'' in implementing the trade law. Rather, she said, the administation hoped that it had laid out the priorities it would be working to achieve in opening markets over the next year. Hills received general praise from members of the trade subcommittee for her decision. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said that the administration had managed to walk a fine line between sounding `` tough enough to say we mean business but also saying we are here to negotiate. Some congressmen questioned why the administration had chosen such a limited target list. For <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the products covered by the negotiations will be supercomputers, satellites and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lumber. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said the countries and items named represented a judgment call on the part of the administration of the areas which offered the best possibility of expanding markets for American products within the tight negotiating deadlines set by the trade provision, called `` Super 301.'' Countries not named to the priority list this year could still be named when the administration is required to present a new list next year, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said. Shortly after <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>' appearance, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipbuilding industry group announced that it had filed a complaint challenging shipyard subsidies provided by the governments of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The petition, filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group, requested that <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> begin negotiations to end the subsidies being provided by the four countries. The shipbuilding group unveiled its demands during a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference attended by several senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who represent cities with shipyards with many of them complaining about the closing of 55 shipyards since 1978 with a loss of 60,000 jobs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> has 45 days to decide whether to accept the petition and begin negotiations with the countries to end the subsidies. During her testimony, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> announced that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would begin talks next week on a broad range of Japanese `` structural'' impediments to trade. She said she hoped these initial discussions would lay the groundwork for talks aimed at removing various broad-based impediments to trade such as the Japanese distribution system.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee heard opposing views Thursday on a bill to reduce regulation in the shipment of goods by sea between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports, one of the last heavily regulated forms of transportation. The measure would primarily affect the shipment of goods to and from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and other island territories. It would put all such traffic under the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulates some shipments that start out on rail or truck. In some cases, shippers can choose which federal agency they want to have oversee their rates. `` Some island communities feel they are captive to those few carriers that serve their island, while other domestic trade areas have vigorous competition that help restrain rates,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the merchant marine subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries. `` This bill deregulates a great deal,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, `` but, frankly, it retains the concept of economic regulations where the public interest demands a degree of oversight.'' In the first of two scheduled hearings on the measure, domestic ocean carriers varied in their reactions to the bill. A hearing next week is to include federal regulators, state representatives and shippers. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> opposed the bill, saying regulation by the maritime commission would prohibit shipments by contracts which are allowed under <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> regulations. `` This bill would severely compromise competition in the interstate transportation marketplace and it would unduly restrict a carrier's ability to tailor services to shipper requirements in a timely manner,'' <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, president of Gulf Puerto Rican Transport, supported a provision in the bill that would prohibit the government of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> from requiring its agencies to use vessels operated by the state-owned carrier even though its prices may be higher that other carriers. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 12 vessels serving the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries, said having two agencies regulate shipping has resulted in `` confusing and conflicting regulations.'' He said some shippers have tried to avoid paying for services by filing complaints that their shipments should have been covered by a different federal agency.

<TEXT>
 An aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Thursday the one-year timeframe President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set for an East-West accord on cutting conventional forces and arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was more a goal than a deadline. West German Gen. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s panel of allied commanders, had questioned the timetable as <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and his colleagues held their spring meeting at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` It's a real challenge,'' <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> told reporters. `` It's optimistic, indeed Unrealistic? I do n't know. ... If we make it in 12 months, I do not know.'' At a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> last week, the allies agreed to a proposal advanced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on specific cuts in troops and combat aircraft. His new plan came in response to a flurry of recent arms control initiatives by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants accord reached within six to 12 months at East-West talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 each and cut about 750 combat planes from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces and 3,000 from the seven-nation <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. The president said that if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> withdraws 30,000 troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> withdraws 325,000, each side then would have 275,000 troops remaining. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> discussed the timetable with the defense ministers. A <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> aide, briefing reporters, agreed it was `` ambitious'' to expect a conventional arms accord within a year. But, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put it up as a goal, not a deadline.'' He said success at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks hinged on Soviet willingness to reach an accord. `` It's up to the Soviets, now.'' The aide pointed to an improved East-West disarmament climate and said, `` We are moving already much faster than before.'' The ministers will end their two-day meeting Friday by reaffirming the goal for all <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> nations to increase annual defense budgets by 3 percent after inflation. The <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> aide said that although most members _ including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ will not achieve that goal this year, the defense chiefs agreed it would be unwise to drop 3 percent as an objective. This week, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials held their first talks on how to implement <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aircraft proposal: how and where to cut 750 combat aircraft from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> air forces and which aircraft should be scrapped. East and West are already negotiating cuts in such armaments as tanks and artillery throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks that began this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added troops and combat aircraft in response to a flurry of recent arms control initiatives by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Officials said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> panel considering aircraft cuts will meet weekly until September to beat what <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> termed the `` very severe time factor'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put on his proposals. `` For instance, how is this to be broken down among the different nations? We have to consider the role each nation has.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said there was `` general agreement'' among the ministers not to reduce British and French planes that can carry conventional or nuclear bombs. Also excluded, they said, must be the 72 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 jets <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will be moving from <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to a base in southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The move follows <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s decision to end a basing accord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The ministers reviewed on Thursday their efforts to maintain an equitable sharing of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s defense costs _ an issue that has generated criticism in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that many <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies do not pull their weight in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated Thursday he plans a hard-line approach on new clean-air standards that will `` significantly improve'' the quality of life of all North Americans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will unveil his clean-air package Monday, met with industry leaders who said they pleaded against coming up with standards too tough to be affordable. `` We urged him to make certain that, when the dust settles on clean air, that we have a healthy economy left,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a business coalition. `` We'll have to wait until Monday to see whether or not the point got through,'' <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said after he and other industry officials met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House. Later, at a session with environmental leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he was ready to move ahead with strong measures, participants said. `` He said that he agreed this is a freight train coming down the track,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` He felt that he strongly personally wanted to be out front on this.'' <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, said `` We are calling on him to again do a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. It is time for him to exercise leadership and call for strong measures to protect the health of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' She was referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s dramatic call last month for unilateral troop cuts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> She said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was given information on air quality in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he has a vacation home. `` He was shocked to know that last summer, there were many days in which there were serious health problems from ozone smog,'' she said. White House aides, as well as participants at both the industry and environmental meetings, insisted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not made up his mind on many aspects of the package, the first major overhaul of the 1970 Clean Air Act in 12 years. Administration aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, however, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had already decided on many key parts of the legislation _ including tough new standards for cleaning up smokestack emissions that cause acid rain, changes that would prove costly to industry. The president has also decided on rigid new standards to prevent chemical contamination of the air. These standards will be far-reaching, extending to hundreds of categories of businesses, ranging from paint factories to bakeries, the sources said. Such suggestions prompted praise from congressional Democrats even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> submitted his proposal. `` He has wholly reversed the position of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on this subject,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Speaking to a hunters' conservation group, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reinforced the contention that his proposals would prove costly to industry and be wide-ranging. `` For too long, we've focused on cleanup and penalties after the damage is already done. It's time to reorient ourselves using technologies and processes that reduce or prevent pollution _ to stop it before it starts. In the 1990s, pollution prevention will go right to the sources,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Power plants and other industries that burn coal in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, many of which disperse their pollutants through tall smokestacks without technological controls, will be a key target of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean-air attack, the sources said These emissions have been cited as a major cause in the acid-rain pollution that afflicts lakes and wildlife in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Northeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In his remarks to <ORGANIZATION> Ducks </ORGANIZATION> Unlimited, a conservation group of waterfowl hunters that seeks to protect and preserve wetlands, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared: `` I will unveil the most sweeping changes to the Clean Air Act since it was last amended 12 years ago.'' `` It will allow us to recover and restore precious forests, lakes and streams. And whether Americans live near factories, in cities, or in high woodland country, it will significantly improve every North American's quality of life.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, said the industry leaders who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` asked the president for a flexible solution that would be cost effective. And he said he had n't made up his mind on a lot of factors yet.'' `` He did n't make any commitments on anything. We need to have a bill that's on an economically sound basis,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> voiced some skepticism toward one feature that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said will be in the legislation _ a program to encourage alternate motor fuels such as alcohol blends. `` We need more studies on alternate fuels,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He said that car engines that can accept alcohol blends use greater volumes of fuel than gasoline-only engines _ suggesting either larger fuel tanks in vehicles or the building of more service stations. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left little doubt that he will submit a tough bill. `` We hope this bill will reflect flexibility,'' he said. `` It will be a strong bill. But this is a starting point rather than an ending point.'' <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON> said that much would happen to the bill when it gets to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where rival clean-air measures are already advancing through both chambers.

 The armed forces can save money if they rely on advertising to obtain recruits instead of more recruiters or cash bonuses, according to studies released Thursday. And at least in the case of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, they said the advertising should be placed in national magazines and local newspapers first, with television the next priority and local radio last. The report on military advertising was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Pentagon-supported think tank based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It was asked to study the issue by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s manpower office. Rand issued two studies, one focusing on <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> advertising efforts and the other assessing whether the services should do their own ads or whether `` joint'' ads with the other armed forces work as well. The studies, focusing on military advertising campaigns from 1981 to 1984, were done by researchers <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Polich </PERSON>. The research dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> found advertising does make a difference in an era of the all-volunteer military and cuts in the ad budget will hurt. `` The empirical results show that, in general, advertising expenditures in a given month have a significant and immediate effect on the number of high-quality enlistments in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' the study said. `` We estimated the marginal cost of recruiting a high-quality person through increased advertising to be between $ 5,000 and $ 6,000. The marginal cost of achieving the same goal by increasing the recruiting staff was about $ 5,700, and the cost of using cash bonuses was much higher, about $ 16,000 per recruit.'' There also appear to be significant differences among the media in their cost effectiveness, at least for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the study continued. `` National magazine and local newspaper advertising are the most cost effective in promoting short-run enlistment responses, costing $ 2,000 and $ 3,400 per additional recruit. National broadcasting purchases also have strong effects but ... appear to cost somewhat more than the print media, $ 7,000 to $ 10,000 per marginal recruit. `` At the other extreme, local radio has no detectable effect on short-run enlistments.'' In 1984, the study said, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 45 million on recruiting ads and used two-thirds of that money for TV spots. As for the issue of individual `` service'' advertisements as opposed to `` joint'' ads, the second study concluded both types `` appear to be very powerful tools'' and in general can produce a new recruit for roughly the same outlay of cash. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, however, do appear to benefit the most from joint ads, while the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> seem to do the best with individual ads. `` But in general, ... the gains of any one branch do not seem to come at the expense, in terms of lost recruits, of any othr,'' the study said. `` Each branch gained recruits from the civilian population rather than at the others' expense.''

 Thousands of ethnic rioters attacked government offices and a police station in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> in a bloody bid to seize firearms, raising the death toll in a five-day rampage to at least 71, official media said Thursday. `` Corpses are being found in gutted houses and the wounded are dying in hospitals,'' Uzbek Premier <PERSON> Gairat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadyrov </PERSON> told the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. At least 71 people were killed and the figure was likely to continue climbing, he said. The violence began June 3 with fighting between ethnic Uzbeks and the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority, forcibly resettled in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1944. Officials have not been able to contain it despite evacuating more than 10,000 of the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> minority and sending in 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials asked the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies parliament Thursday to approve `` more decisive measures to stabilize the situation'' in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, deputy <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Yastrebov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He represents the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yastrebov </PERSON> said he could not specify measures under consideration. He said a group of deputies, including some from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, were told to investigate the latest developments and report back to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday before a decision is taken. West German sources said in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Thursday that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has cut the agenda for his four-day West German visit next week to stay in touch with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> over events in his troubled nation. They cited the unrest in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> as one factor. The bloodshed in eastern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> was the latest in a series of violent clashes that have embroiled the southern rim of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for more than a year. Scores of people have been killed in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, but the violence has spread recently to <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> in Central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the latest spark was Wednesday in <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION> when `` thousands of people excited by alcohol, drugs and calls for violence ... stormed the city police department to seize firearms.'' At the same time a crowd of 500 to 600 attacked a local <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> transportation office, it said. The attacks failed, but a preliminary count indicated six people were killed. More than 90, including soldiers, were injured. Sixty-five houses and six offices were burned down, it said. `` More houses are burning,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> added. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the soldiers were given orders to shoot to protect themselves, but so far had avoided opening fire. `` The crowds of attackers have been dispersed and most active rioters have been detained,'' it said. Official Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said more than 600 people have been hurt and more than 400 suspects in the ethnic violence have been arrested. The official radio said that shooting and arson attempts continued Wednesday night in the regional center of <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION>, with a population of more than 200,000. More than 400 houses, most of them belonging to <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, had been burned down. The official reports did not specify which ethnic group was responsible for the attacks in <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION>, but it was likely Uzbeks because the Meskhis have been the victims of most of the violence and many of them already have been evacuated. Uzbek sources said the violence, which started with a dispute over the price of strawberries in a bazaar, erupted because of smoldering resentment among Uzbeks over what they see as preferential treatment of the minority. The dispute led to a wave of `` pogroms, arson, beatings and murder, accompanied by harassment and rape in conjunction with insolent marauding, resistance to police and internal security forces,'' <PERSON> Kadyrov </PERSON> said. `` Passions are still boiling,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> added. The Uzbek grassroots movement <PERSON> Berlik </PERSON> called on the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to remedy living conditions, which it said was an underlying cause of the bloodshed. The activists claim cotton production quotas imposed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has forced <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> to neglect food crops. Meanwhile, the campaign to boost cotton production has forced farms to poison the enviromment with vast quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, they say.

 Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said he may subpoena drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> after <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> declined to testify Thursday before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee on the drug problem in the nation's capital. `` We had hoped today to hear from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the director of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, about his plan for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Governmental Affairs. `` Unfortunately ... Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> refuses to testify, at least until Sept. 8.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, said 74 different congressional committees and subcommittes claim responsibility for the federal anti-drug effort. `` The director ca n't satisfy everyone and at the same time prepare the national strategy he's required by law to prepare by Sept. 5,'' said <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. At the hearing, the committee heard witnesses including <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Assistant Director <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> on the district's drug trafficking problem, which authorities have blamed for a record annual murder rate two years in a row. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Democrat, said his staff offered to change the date of the hearing to fit <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s schedule, but he still declined. `` We're trying to work together with Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, trying to give him support, trying to get funding for his programs ... and he ca n't give us the time of day, anytime,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> would appear before the committee if he had to issue a subpoena to compel his testimony. He said he had a letter delivered to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s office early Thursday expressing his concerns, but did not disclose details of the letter. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> drafted a national anti-drug plan that calls for construction of new pre-trial detention and prison facilities, expansion of a local law enforcement task force, efforts to rid public housing of drug users and dealers, expansion of drug treatment facilities and an increase in job training programs. However, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> criticized the district government and said the city would receive no direct funds from the estimated $ 70 million to $ 80 million sought for the program. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> led the nation in murders per capita last year with 372 slayings, most of them drug-related. This year, there have been 197 homicides, compared with 127 at the same time last year.

 Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed in the military assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students' organization said Thursday. The Union of Chinese Students in the Federal Republic also urged the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government to impose sanctions on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the weekend killings. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bo </PERSON>, a university student in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, said the union found out through communications with friends in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> estimates 3,600 people died and 60,000 were injured when soldiers routed protesters from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The Chinese government says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed. Chinese and foreign diplomats say up to 3,000 died. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the union presented a young man who the students said was a witness to the bloodshed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and had just returned to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Chinese man, who said he works for a company in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said army troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> shot indiscriminately at civilians and their homes. `` I still have not recovered from this. It disturbs me very much,'' said the man, who would not give his name for fear of possible retaliation against his relatives. `` A nurse I know went looking for her husband at a hospital. Bodies there were stacked one on top of the other,'' said the man. The man said hospital officials told his nurse friend, `` How can we look for him? There are so many bodies.''

 An accountant accused of killing five family members 18 years ago was transferred from federal to state custody Thursday, but his wife insisted that authorities had the wrong man. In a brief hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> authorized federal officials to release <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who authorities say actually is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> fugitive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> List </PERSON>, into <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> custody until he can be extradited. Later Thursday, a county judge set a hearing for July 6 and ordered him jailed without bail. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Delores </PERSON>, said at a news conference that she does not believe her husband is the 63-year-old List, who is charged with murdering his mother, wife, and three children in 1971. `` I love my husband very deeply. I do not believe this is the same man,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said she had seen her husband in jail but they had not discussed the case. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has not admitted he is List, but authorities have identified him by his fingerprints and physical markings. `` I anticipate having no trouble identifying him and bringing him to trial,'' said Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was arrested June 1 at the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> accounting firm where he had worked for a year and a half. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents had been tipped off by a viewer of the national television program `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' which 11 days earlier had run a segment focusing on List. Authorities say List had fled to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and had built a new life without changing his appearance, profession or reputation as a quiet, churchgoing Lutheran. `` I'm looking forward to seeing him,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, Detective Lt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, who has been working on the List case for 10 years. `` He's had 18 years of freedom and it's time the prosecution started and he pay for his crimes.'' `` It's gratifying as a prosecutor when someone who has intentionally been eluding you so long is finally apprehended and can be brought back,'' said <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. `` It kind of brings a close to a chapter in one of the most notorious murder cases in Union history.''

 Fog delayed some flights and the painters had n't finished rehabbing Eastern's planes, but <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was greeted like a conquering hero Thursday as he christened his new shuttle with champagne, <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> and glitz The Trump Shuttle, newly acquired from strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for $ 365 million, carried its billionaire boss from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and back, on to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At every stop, he was met by ebullient crowds in airport terminals. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s crowded <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> terminal, festooned with red and white balloons, a string quartet played <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> near a buffet laden with mimosa cocktails of champagne and orange juice, muffins and fresh fruit. `` I think this is fabulous,'' said one young businessman en route to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> could n't meet his advertised claim for getting the flights off precisely on time. The 8 a.m. EDT flight from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> National took off at about 8:17 a.m., while a flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was delayed by the weather and heavy traffic. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> personally greeted passengers boarding the flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which was packed with reporters and regular travelers. At one point during the flight, the billionaire grabbed the public address microphone to announce, `` Ladies and gentlemen, this is your flight attendant.'' A crew member announced a slight detour as the flight entered airspace over <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> owns several big gambling hotels. Flight attendants, dressed in temporary navy-blue uniforms with burgundy stripes on the sleeves, handed out miniature bottles of champagne. `` The name ` <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>' carries a lot of weight,'' said flight attendant <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, 33, an 11-year Eastern veteran. `` We're all very excited about it.'' Most of the Northeast shuttle's employees worked for Eastern before the crippling strike against the Miami-based carrier began three months ago and pushed the airline into bankruptcy court. For many long-time <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s debut was bittersweet. They were relieved to be working again but sad about colleagues left behind on picket lines. `` Our hearts are with them, our thoughts are with them,'' flight captain <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Comer </PERSON> said. `` I wish them the best of luck.'' Comer, an Eastern pilot for 25 years, now is chief pilot for <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION>. The real estate tycoon signed the papers formally closing the sale on Wednesday and staff worked through the night to clean planes and put up new signs at the terminals. Some changes will take more time. Only four of Trump Shuttle's fleet of 21 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s had been repainted by opening day in the new color scheme: white fuselage with red, black and gold stripes, the word `` Trump'' above the stripes and a red `` T'' on the tail Several aircraft sitting on the ramp looked like the hybrids they were: `` Trump'' had been painted in red above the familiar Eastern silver and blue. Inside, the planes still had the old brown-gold Eastern color scheme. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> plans to refurbish the interiors in burgundy and saddle-brown tones, with chrome and maple wood veneer accents. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and the other passengers arriving at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> National were welcomed by a string and accordion quintet playing `` Casino Royale'' and `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' A statuesque blond violinist, <PERSON> Janette </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, mugged with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for photographers. And of course there was more champagne, passed around by waiters in formal black-tie who also proffered canapes. `` The enthusiasm of the people working for the airline is unbelievable,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> told a news conference at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> airport. He promised shuttle fares, $ 99 each way and $ 69 on weekends, will remain unchanged for the near future.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> on Thursday urged nations with strong democratic traditions to help reinforce fledging democracies like her own by forming an <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` Democracy needs support and the best support for democracy comes from other democracies. ... Democratic nations should ... come together in an association designed to help each other and promote what is a universal value _ democracy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said in her keynote address at 338th commencement exercises at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, her alma mater. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said the association could help bolster freedom by sending observers to monitor elections in countries struggling to maintain democracy. `` It is much harder to steal an election if the whole world is watching,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told an estimated crowd of 25,000. An association of democracies could also mobilize world opinion against leaders of any coup and take such steps as economic sanctions while using foreign aid as a reward for democracy, she said. `` There is nothing wrong with rewarding an idea in which the donors believe. The prospects for democracy may depend upon it,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> added a plea for understanding <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> countries, saying many outsiders mistakenly believe democracy ca n't survive in a country like <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` But I stand before you, a <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> woman, the elected prime minister of one hundred million Muslims, a living refutation of such arguments,'' she said. The 35-year-old prime minister, the first woman in modern times to lead a Moslem country, is a 1973 graduate of <LOCATION> Radcliffe </LOCATION>. When asked at a brief news conference later to comment on recent events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have a very old association and friendship and it was through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> restored its links with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We regret the loss of human lives and would like to see a return to the restraint that was initially taken,'' she continued. `` Many who have friendships with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have been very disturbed with what has been going on there.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who also holds a degree from <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, picked up the populist political mantle of her father, deposed and executed Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. The elder <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was overthrown in 1977 by Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> and executed by hanging two years later. In the ensuing years, <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON>, oldest of <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s four children and the one he tapped as his political successor, spent seven years in arrest and detention. She went into self-imposed exile in 1984 and from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> she became leader-in-exile of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> People's Party. In 1986 she returned home. Three months after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was killed in a plane crash, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> claimed victory in the first democratic election in her country in 11 years. Since her arrival in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has met privately with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other government officials and addressed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. She planned to visit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Friday before departing the next day for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 Senators advocating disability benefits for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans suffering from cancer they believe caused by Agent <PERSON> Orange </PERSON> said Thursday they were confident of finally winning congressional passage after repeated setbacks. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the compromise bill would provide interim disability benefits to veterans who were exposed to the chemical defoliant during the Vietnam War and now suffer from either non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma Under the bill, disability benefits would extend only through 1993. Survivors' benefits for spouses would go through mid-April 1992. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which by then would have received a new study by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, would have to vote to continue the benefits. The measure is needed `` not only to help veterans with their medical difficulties, but it is also important as a statement that we intend to make good on our promises to help those who fought in the war,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who piloted a patrol boat in the <ORGANIZATION> Mekong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. `` Too many veterans remember what it was like to fight the VC -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- They did n't have to come back here to fight the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the name still used for the Veterans Department -RRB-,'' the senator said. Separate Agent Orange bills sponsored by <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, failed in 1987 and again last year. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration steadfastly opposed the proposals, saying more scientific evidence was needed to link the chemical defoliant used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to the cancers in the light of several studies that failed to find such a link. But <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, at a news conference introducing the legislation, said positive signs from both the new administration and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> account for their optimism. The senators said they were encouraged by Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> and his decision last month not to appeal a federal appeals court's decision striking down regulations to restrict compensation for Agent Orange victims. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> also ordered reviews of the cases of all <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans whose Agent Orange claims were denied. <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> as the `` most sympathetic'' head of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> since the Vietnam War. The bill's prospects improved when Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, backed it late last year after various changes to narrow its scope The measure would cost an estimated $ 19 million annually in benefits, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides said.

<HEAD>Salvadorans Improperly Transferred U.S. Fuel to Contras, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s air force improperly sold $ 100,000 worth of fuel provided by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to air crews resupplying the Nicaraguan Contras in an effort set up by <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. Assistant Comptroller General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON> testified that the transfer of the fuel `` violated agreements between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> stipulating that title or possession of U.S.-supplied defense items or services can not be transferred without prior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government consent.'' <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON> said pilots under contract to the Contra resupply operation run by former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> bought fuel on at least 63 occasions in 1986 from tanks on the military side of <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. He said U.S.-supplied fuel was provided on 32 of those occasions. <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON> testified on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigatory arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations Foreign Operations subcommittee. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON>, a private individual supporting the Contra effort, had, at the request of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, set up an operations center at the <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> base to use air drops inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to resuply the Contras. <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON> said that from April to September 1986 the Salvadoran air force old 61,107 gallons of the U.S.-provided fuel to the Contra resupply enterprise. `` We found no evidence that the Salvadoran government requested or obtained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consent for the Salvadoran air force to transfer military aid program funded fuel to the Contra supply operation,'' <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON> said. Nor, he said, was evidence found that any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel knew of the sales. But he said a `` substantial violation'' of the 1986 sales agreement with <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> may have occurred because the transfers took place at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was barred by law from using aid funds to support military or paramilitary operations of the Contras. <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON> said it was also learned that the Salvadoran air force sold nearly a million gallons of aviation fuel worth some $ 580,000 to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and contract aircraft delivering non-lethal aid to the Contras. He said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> accepted as `` reasonable'' the explanation that those transfers were not improper because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government provided the fuel in the first place and because it was transferred to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entities. But Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, said it would seem `` unique'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put itself in the position of first giving away the fuel, then paying for it `` You could well say we were paying for it twice,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, who initiated the investigation, said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> had `` uncovered the first documented case of a transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid dollars to the Contra resupply network.'' Additionally, he said, when sales to other `` third-party'' aircraft are taken into account, `` the Salvadoran air force received $ 800,000 in cash for fuel it received free under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid program.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, acting assistant secretary for state for <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, acknowleged that the sales and transfers did take place. But he said the department does not believe the violation to be `` substantial,'' given the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> $ 230 million worth of aviation fuel in 1986 and 1987. `` Furthermore, it does not appear that the transferred fuel sustained the Nicaraguan resistance resupply operations over an extended period of time, nor does it appear that this was support that the resistance could not have purchased from any commercial facility,'' he said. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said a `` lack of understanding'' on the part of ground personnel at <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> as to which fuel required <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permission before it could be transferred `` seems to have been the main, if not the most important, factor in this unauthorized diversion.'' <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diehl </PERSON> <PERSON> McKalip </PERSON>, operations director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said that because of a concern that assistance funds might have been or might be `` converted into unrestricted cash,'' regulations have been issued to assure that any future funds generated from fuel transfers be deposited in a special holding account. Prior to the change, he said, $ 801,519 was paid directly to the Salvadoran air force. Since the change, $ 973,543 has been credited to the holding account, <PERSON> McKalip </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Thursday met the widow of slain Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, who established relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> seven years ago. <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> met for 15 minutes with the pope, who `` spoke with warmth about <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s visits to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'' before he was gunned down in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> in 1986, said Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, who was at the meeting. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said the pontiff had asked to see Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, who is due to testify next week against in the murder trial of <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, which began on Monday. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was arrested last December. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, an overwhelmingly Lutheran country, established diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1982, largely because of <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>'s admiration for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s concern for social issues. Palme visited the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> twice. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> spoke with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> about her work as head of the Swedish chapter of <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization for children, <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> met separately with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on political issues focusing on eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the elections in the pontiff's native <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> was the final leg on a five-nation tour of <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has been extolling the virtues of traditional religious teachings in an area with liberal views on sex, marriage and birth control. In one of his strongest homilies on the subject during his 10-day pilgrimage, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told a mass of 16,000 people that `` the future of humanity comes by way of the family.'' `` It is not alway easy today for married couples to live in a lifelong covenant marked by mutual fidelity, respect and love,'' he said. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s liberal attitudes prompted reporters to ask a senior <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, Australian archbishop <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, why the pope would come to a country that permits abortion and accepts homosexuality, and where the divorce rate is high among the 50 percent of couples who bother to marry. `` It's a conflict of what one considers the common good,'' said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s undersecretary of state. `` The pope either preaches the gospel or he does n't preach.'' Many of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s 135,000 Catholics are immigrants from more than 50 countries, and the pope could see colorful costumes of a dozen nationalities as he gazed from the podium of the spherical Globe sports stadium. `` Pray for Chinese Students,'' read one banner waving from the crowd. In a remark directed at the immigrants and at some Swedes who are reluctant to accept them, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> urged them to practice `` full participation in the social, political and cultural life of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>.'' `` Not only native-born Swedes, but also immigrants need to take their proper place in society so that they too can make a positive contribution to the country to which they now belong,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> will reopen a probe into an alleged scheme to rig the awarding of federally subsidized housing in <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> announced Thursday. `` I have asked the inspector general to reopen his investigation into the situation surrounding <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> and the allocation of federally subsidized housing in the village of <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in a news release. Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s region II adminstrator, is at the center of the controversy. Her son, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McGann </PERSON>, was among those chosen to purchase a $ 44,500 house in the program. Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> is a village board member and last year was appointed <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Region II administrator. A cousin of Republican Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, a longtime resident of <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, also benefitted from the program by buying a home for $ 40,000, according to a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit. Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> asked for and was granted an administrative leave, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Thursday. She will continue to collect her $ 68,500 annual salary, according to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nipp </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Thursday. A woman answering the phone in her office said Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> would not be at work. The new investigation was triggered by a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that officials in <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a predominantly white <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> village, had distributed federally subsidized homes to politically connected people and excluded blacks between 1980 and 1984. The Times based its story on a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit of the program. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also announced high-level <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees will no longer be allowed to serve on state or local government boards, agencies or panels, and no <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employee at any level may serve on any such body that does business with the department. In addition, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in the statement that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> discretionary funds will be targeted at ending homelessness, enforcing fair housing and creating enterprise zones, for example. The Times report noted that <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> had persuaded former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Piece </PERSON> to earmark $ 425,000 from the fund for a swimming pool in the oceanfront community. The pool has not been built because the project has been tied up in local politics. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s cousin, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccimarro </PERSON>, paid $ 40,000 for one of the subsidized houses, according to the 1984 audit. On Thursday, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> denied any involvement, and termed the program `` excellent.'' `` I know of no abuse and I know of no preferential treatment,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I wrote no applications nor made any applications on -LRB- people's -RRB- behalf. Had they asked me I would have. I thought the program was a good program.'' Under the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program, <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, which has a population of 4,200 and is 97 percent white, received enough money to build 44 homes to be sold at $ 40,000 to $ 64,000 each. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> proposed that 17 of the 22 houses to be built during the project's second phase be sold to blacks from nearby areas, but none were. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers to reach lower-income buyers, especially minorities. But some residents were tipped off, and by the time the ads appeared, 22 buyers had been selected, the Times said. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said he did not believe there were tips or that no houses were purchased by members of minority groups. He blamed the Times story on `` a disgruntled former employee,'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>'s village clerk at the time. `` It's obvious that the former village clerk, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, has changed his story in order to attack his former associates on the village board for whatever reasons, and that saddens me,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> told the Times that he misled <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials probing the program in 1984. He said Mrs. <PERSON> McGann </PERSON> had called him to inquire about a HUD house for her son, and also said he had covered up for her. <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> did not immediately return a message left on his answering machine. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said the story was based primarily on a 5-year-old preliminary audit. `` I've been given to believe that the inspector general's final report did not concur with that 5-year-old preliminary audit, and found no evidence of wrongdoing,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he did not know what final report <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> was referring to.

<TEXT>
 Three Puerto Rican nationalists drew maximum sentences of up to 15 years in prison Thursday for their roles in a $ 7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery in 1983. But one of them, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a civil rights attorney from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was released on $ 200,000 bond pending appeal of his conviction on a conspiracy charge. <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>, 53, had been free on the same bond prior to his sentencing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> agreed to a bond after expressing concern about <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>'s high blood pressure and acknowledging that grounds exist for an appeal to the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, the judge sentenced <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> to five years in prison and fined him $ 100,000. `` I'm very happy that I can go back home,'' a jubilant <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> said outside the courtroom. The defendant receiving the stiffest penalty was <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Negron </PERSON>, a 45-year-old auto mechanic. He was given a 15-year prison term and fined $ 150,000 on a conspiracy count and a charge of assisting in the transfer of some of the stolen cash to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The third man, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Talavera </PERSON>, a 32-year-old graphic artist convicted on a conspiracy charge, received a five-year prison term and was fined $ 50,000. Like <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> told the court they will appeal their cases. `` I struggled for the liberty of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, who strode into the courtroom with his fist raised and wearing a red carnation. His supporters, including his wife, also stood with raised fists. The judge rejected the political argument, just as he had throughout the trial. `` There is no right to rob money,'' <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> said. `` It is a crime throughout the world. No one has been charged because of his political views.'' Afterward, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said only that the defendants had received the maximum prison terms `` and that's what the government asked.'' He declined to comment on <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>'s continued release The three defendants, who were convicted April 10, were said to be members of a militant Puerto Rican separatist group, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>. Members of the organization are accused of engineering the Sept. 12, 1983, theft of a half-ton of money from a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> to finance their activities. A fourth defendant, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, had his sentencing postponed to next week. The 39-year-old <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate, is accused of masterminding the robbery and faces up to 165 years in prison. None is accused of taking part in the actual holdup. A former <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> security guard, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerena </PERSON>, is accused of taking the money, only $ 80,000 of which has been recovered. He is believed to be in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 The government said Thursday it has rejected a Soviet extradition request for a Soviet air force pilot who defected in a MiG-29 jet fighter, and it indicated it was willing to send him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> landed at the airport in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> May 20 and requested political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Turkish officials, appearing anxious to limit the damage to Turkish-Soviet relations, sent the jet back a day after the incident. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also asked Turkish officials to extradite the pilot, saying he stole the sophisticated plane after shooting and wounding a guard at <LOCATION> Tskhakaya </LOCATION> airport. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> denied the request and gave <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON>'s asylum petition to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announcement Thursday. The statement said a <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> court ruled Tuesday that the accusations against <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> were political and military, allowing him to qualify for refugee status. Soviet authorities had been informed of the decision, the announcement said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have criticized <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for denying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> representatives a chance to inspect the aircraft and learn more about the latest Soviet technology.

 Taxi drivers in this <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburb are more wary about who they pick up, and some have stopped driving at night since the slayings of four cabbies have sparked fears of a serial killer. Three of the four drivers shot to death since April 1 worked for the Day & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Night </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, including 30-year-old <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON>, who was buried Wednesday.

Police said he was beaten and shot twice, apparently after being forced out of his taxi. The other three were slain in similar fashion, their bodies found in the nearby suburb of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, College Park and inside <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> city limits, near <LOCATION> College </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. College Park police Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacks </PERSON> said authorities have n't established for certain that one person is behind the crimes. But he said they have n't ruled out that possibility either. `` Contrary to what people think, we do n't really know if we've got a serial killer,'' Jacks said `` It could be a coincidence. There are a whole lot of loose ends in this case.'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police Detective C.R. Price agreed, but added that the serial killer theory is viable. `` We have reason to believe that because they -LRB- the slayings -RRB- all occurred among cabbies working the south side,'' he said. <PERSON> Jacks </PERSON> said no physical evidence has been found so far to link the killings, except that all the victims were cabbies, all worked in the same area and robbery did not appear to be the sole motive. `` Some of the victims still had money on them, but of course you do n't know how much they had to begin with,'' <PERSON> Jacks </PERSON> said. `` There's not enough evidence to say they were all robberies. The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> was brought into the case this week to lend its expertise and crime laboratory to the three police departments working on the killings, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bankhead </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jacks </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON>'s taxi was being examined at the lab this week for possible clues, such as hair and other fibers. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said 16 cab drivers in the city have died violently since 1980. That includes one of the four recent victims; the others were found just outside the city limits.

 Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stretched a 20-minute appointment Thursday with the editor of a dissident Soviet journal into a one-hour, 10-minute discussion of ethnic violence in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a spokesman said. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, editor of the unofficial magazine `` Glasnost'' later told a news conference that he had discussed with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> the killing of 22 Soviet Georgians in the city of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on April 9. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said he believed the killings had been orchestrated by the Kremlin to provide a pretext for cracking down on democratic movements in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, especially those in the non-Russian republics. The killings, however, provoked an outcry in the Soviet parliament and there has been no nation-wide crackdown. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> version of events differed sharply from official accounts.

 Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> on Thursday congratulated soldiers who crushed a popular movement for democracy, and the government urged citizens to turn in those who resisted the bloody military raid on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was relatively quiet Thursday after days of random shooting, but gunfire broke out again after dark. Unrest was reported in other cities, and provincial leaders called for harsh action against demonstrators. Soldiers fired weapons at about 11 p.m. in the direction of foreign journalists outside the <LOCATION> Jianguo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main boulevard, but it was not clear whether they were aiming at the reporters. Hundreds of trucks in convoys moved tons of supplies into <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> overnight, and hundreds more continued the resupply operation Thursday. For about an hour during one delivery, commuters on bicycles ventured across <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> for the first time since Sunday, then police closed it again. Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and 60,000 injured in the weekend military assault on protesters, according to a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students' organization in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the Union of Chinese Students in the Federal Republic. The government says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed, but Chinese and foreign diplomats say up to 3,000 died. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s televised speech to soldiers in the Great Hall of the People, on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, was his first public appearance since the crackdown. `` You've done well, comrades,'' he told the cheering troopers, and admonished them to `` continue working hard to protect the capital's safety and order.'' The hard-line premier ordered martial law May 20 after a series of protests in which up to 1 million people rallied in the streets to demand an end to official profiteering and corruption and more democratic freedoms. In the government's attempt to establish its own version of events, which includes a statement Wednesday that no one was killed in the square, television showed civilians burning military trucks and armored personnel carriers, and the charred bodies of three soldiers, one with his stomach slit open. Evening television also showed soldiers stooping to clear gravel and debris from littered streets and others, with smiles, aiding elderly people with slight injuries. The government declared student and labor organizers to be `` important members of the counterrevolutionary turmoil,'' and ordered leaders of the pro-democracy movement to give themselves up. Radio and television urged people to turn in fellow citizens who had engaged in `` hooliganism and destruction,'' broadcasting telephone numbers for the convenience of informers. Students who organized the seven-week campaign said they had gone underground but would continue the fight for democratic rights. `` We are prepared to drop our peaceful methods and take stronger action against the government,'' said one who telephoned The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a center of the movement, said: `` We do n't know what to do. We are waiting for orders, but our leaders are all gone.'' Another said: `` Maybe new leaders will have to emerge. The movement has n't ended. Things may be calm for awhile, but the army ca n't stay forever. When it goes, we students will protest again.'' Eighty tanks were stationed at Tiananmen Square, including 40 in front of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, with their guns pointed toward the south. Two groups of 10 tanks each faced north along <ORGANIZATION> Changan </ORGANIZATION>, flanking 40 armored personnel carriers. Behind them were about 10,000 soldiers in formation, jogging or standing. It was not clear whether the soldiers were from the 27th army, which shot and bludgeoned its way through the square Saturday night and early Sunday, or were replacement troops. Rumors continued to circulate that the 38th army, assigned to protect <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, either was replacing the 27th or already had done so. Speculation continued that units of other armies might attack those supporting <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. Foreigners were leaving <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in large numbers, including families of diplomats. `` It's just not a wise thing to keep people here at this point,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s international airport, seeing off an evacuation flight `` We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, and the biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pulling them out of town.'' Protests and transportation tieups continued elsewhere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and provincial leaders rallied behind the central government's tough stand. Government leaders in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city, broadcast that `` vast numbers of workers are unable to report to work, and industrial production as well as the citizens' lives are being disrupted.'' Mayor <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongji </PERSON> said he could not guarantee residents' safety The official radio in the western city of <LOCATION> Lanzhou </LOCATION> reported the situation as `` grim'' there and quoted <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> provincial Gov. <PERSON> Jia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhijie </PERSON> as saying `` the dregs of society'' had forcibly occupied `` vital communications lines and important bridges'' and stopped trains. Students went to factories to force workers to strike and `` forcibly order factory directors to halt production.'' `` It is necessary to form a deterrent force against them and develop a situation whereby, when a rat runs across the street, everybody cries ` Kill it!''' <PERSON> Jia </PERSON> declared. A source said soldiers were briefly called into <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, after days of violence. Unconfirmed reports said police shot and killed 20 people as crowds stormed a government building Sunday in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, soldiers still fired into the air and at some bystanders Thursday, but far less often than before. Most residents still stayed away from their jobs, but life was near normal. Thousands took bicycle tours of the city, stopping to gape at bullet holes in buildings and bloodstains on walls. Stores, restaurants and some post offices reopened, and people formed long lines to buy the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Evening News, available for the first time in five days. Both were filled with articles denying heavy casualties among civilians and reporting the reopening of businesses. `` There's no news,'' one reader said in disgust. A student at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Normal said: `` The calm is just superficial. With so many killed there can not be real calm. It's just a matter of time before the movement peaks again.''

 Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> won a seat Thursday on a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> governing board, striking a blow for forces opposed to the school's $ 163.8 million investment in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I ... pray God I will do justice to the honor that has been given me,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said, speaking from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The 1984 Nobel Prize-winner, who promised a year ago to return honorary degrees to any schools that had not divested such holdings by May 1989, said he would not return the diploma <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> conferred on him 10 years ago. Instead, the South African Anglican prelate will use his new spot on the Board of Overseers to lobby against apartheid and for divestment, said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` This is really big news,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, director of Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid. `` I feel very confident that once -LRB- <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> -RRB- arrives there will be enormous pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> to divest.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s victory was the only one claimed by the pro-divestment coalition, which ran four other candidates against an official slate of 10 people backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, both endorsed by the alumni assocation, were the top vote-getters in the write-in election open to all Harvard degree holders. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> came in fourth with 14,226 of the votes cast by 39,897 people, who elected five officials to serve six-year terms on the 30-member board. The panel monitors the university's academic policies and advises the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the school's business affairs. Since 1986, the Harvard-Radcliffe anti-apartheid group has nominated candidates to the 30-member overseers panel by petition and has succeeded in placing three members on the board. The campaign was more heated than any in recent years, with the alumni association and university officials speaking out against electing `` single issue'' candidates. But <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, a professor of philosophy at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, said he was optimistic <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s presence on the panel would encourage other `` progressive'' board members to join the push for divestment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` There are a large number of progressive board members who would feel comfortable rallying to <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s standard,'' <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said. `` In his presence he will be the moral center of the board on this issue.'' <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said it was not immediately clear when <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> would come to <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> to meet with the board, but predicted that `` when he comes, thousands of people will turn out support him.''

 An aide's suggestion to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> has prompted a proposal for a pilot program that could lead <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to recycle the 20,000 tons of garbage and trash generated by Capitol buildings every year. <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to consider a recycling program for the entire Capitol complex, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and six congressional office buildings. As a result of the request from <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, the office of the architect of the Capitol recently proposed to begin recycling garbage from two congressional office buildings as a pilot project. `` If we do n't set the example certainly it wo n't be set elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> said Thursday during a news conference by the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Greenhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The foundation is dedicated to halt a global warming trend known as the `` greenhouse effect.'' One of the group's goals is to slow the cutting of forests. The Republican senator, who made a fortune in the plywood business, became interested in recycling congressional garbage at the suggestion of <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Garczynski </PERSON>, a temporary staff member on loan to his office from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, that it might save money, said <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>' press secretary, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Droogsma </PERSON>. The Capitol Architect's office has suggested the government begin recycling garbage from the <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building, which together house about 5,000 workers, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, director of engineering. `` It will be interesting to see if people will cooperate, he said. Recycling programs require people to segregate items that can be recycled, such as aluminum cans and paper, from items that can not, such as certain plastics or food waste. The pilot project would cost about $ 50,000, mostly to purchase extra containers. The project will need the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees that requested the study.

<TEXT>
 The advertiser-supported Channel One news service for teens will be offered to schools nationwide starting in March 1990, packaged with two new educational networks, the creator of the service said Thursday. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, said his company expects to spend $ 200 million on startup costs involved in giving 8,000 or more schools the video equipment needed to receive Channel One programming. He plans to pay for it with $ 85 million to $ 100 million each year from advertisers who pay to pitch products on Channel One's daily news show. Critics ncluding national educational groups argue that advertisers should not be allowed to pitch their wares to youngsters in the classroom. `` We have listened to our critics,'' <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> told a news conference in announcing the national launch of Channel One. But he said their main complaint about advertising was `` unaddressable.'' He said if schools are going to get both a daily news show and the equipment to show it `` you have to pay for it'' and that advertising is the most feasible way because the federal governmment and corporate philanthropy have not provided the money. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said, he has modified the Channel One service that was tested for five weeks this past spring at six schools across the country and featured ads for jeans, shampoo, chewing gum, candy bars and acne medicine. Whittle said schools signing up for Channel One can have some rather than all of their classrooms wired to receive the program and need not show it to the whole school. However, he said schools that participate still will be obliged to show the program every day in those classrooms that have the Channel One equipment. In addition to Channel One, <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> will donate five hours of satellite time every school day for a channel called the Classroom Channel that would carry non-commercial educational programming. The Classroom Channel would be run by a board independent of Whittle Communcations. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said it was likely the board would decide against allowing advertising on that service. Schools could pick and choose what they want to use from that channel, he said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> would donate $ 500,000 a year for the board to acquire rights to programming for the Classroom Channel. The programs would include public broadcasting documentaries and instructional shows such as an advanced algebra class or language lesson. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said he also was developing a third network, the Educators Channel, to carry programming for educators, such as briefings by national education groups. Schools participating in Channel One would be given equipment to receive all three channels in exchange for running the Channel One program every day. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, who heads a national children's advocacy group, said she was unswayed by <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>'s modifications. `` It's the same deal with better packaging,'' she said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administratrors </ORGANIZATION> said, `` It still turns the classroom into a marketplace for products rather than a marketplace for ideas.'' Whittle hopes to make Channel One available in 1,000 middle and high schools in March 1990 and add schools at a rate of 500 or more a month, giving each school video equipment worth $ 40,000 to $ 50,000. Competition has sprung up since Whittle tested Channel One. <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin a daily ad-free news program for schools starting in August, while the Discovery Channel cable network says it intends to make commercial-free documentary programming. C-Span, the <ORGANIZATION> Cable-Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> that provides coverage of congressional proceedings, has been providing programming for use in the classroom since 1986 and said 3,400 teachers already use it. <PERSON> C-Span </PERSON> is expanding that service starting in late August. But no cable network is donating equipment to the schools on the scale Whittle has envisioned. Whittle released survey results Wednesday indicating students who watched Channel One were better informed about daily events than their counterparts who did not watch it. The surveys also claim a majority of teachers, students and administrators find the commercials an acceptable price to pay for the program.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Hears Argument on America's Cup Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appeals court reserved its decision Thursday on whether the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> broke competition rules or simply one-upped a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> group when it successfully defended the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup with a catamaran. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, told a five-judge panel of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s Appellate Division that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> yacht club did nothing barred by the Deed of Gift, the 1887 document governing the races and the silver cup. He said state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> was wrong when she ruled on March 28 that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> had to forfeit the sailing trophy to the <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. He said the cup should be returned to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompkins </PERSON> argued for Mercury Bay that last September's race was a mismatch between the conventional <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> entry and the much faster double-hull catamaran and violated the spirit of friendly competition envisioned by the race's founders 138 years ago. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, speaking for the state as a trustee of the cup, argued that `` the use of the catamaran is proper as the rules are written. The rules need to be changed.'' He said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> had told Ciparick before the race the type of boat it planned to use and she did not object. <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> should be allowed to keep the cup and some less drastic remedy than forfeiture should be applied. On July 15, 1987, <PERSON> Mercury </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> challenged <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, holder of the cup at the time, to race in a boat that was about 90 feet at the water line, less than a year after the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> club's 1986 win over the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Boats that big had not been raced in more than 50 years. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> rejected the challenge, noting that foreign clubs were already preparing for a 1990 or 1991 race in so-called 12-meter boats _ the number depends more on a complicated design formula than an actual dimension _ and would be unable to compete effectively on terms demanded by Mercury Bay. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> club pointed out that every match since World War II had been raced every three or four years in 12-meter boats, which actually are about 45 feet at the water line. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> catamaran easily defeated Mercury Bay's entry and the case has been in and out of court ever since. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> asked the judges to affirm <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON>'s ruling that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> relinquish the cup to Mercury Bay.

 Army Col. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> was cleared by a jury of conspiracy and bribery charges Thursday in a case in which in which he was accused of helping an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> arms contractor secure $ 3.7 million in weapons sales to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Jurors said they simply did n't believe the contractor, who was the government's chief witness in its attempt to prove two counts of conspiracy and one of bribery. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was accused of accepting $ 70,000 and a Rolex watch from <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Genesco </ORGANIZATION>, Ill. According to the government's case rejected by the jury through its verdicts of innocent, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Reese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION> could receive tax-free money by telling the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that commissions had been paid to an agent. A Salvadoran resident would then act as the fake agent, cash the commission checks and return the cash, minus a fee, to <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> was the prosecution's star witness in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>. `` The testimony of the witness was not credible enough ... just no proof,'' said juror <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Basara </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Chantilly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Another juror, who declined to give her name, said, `` The prosecution's case was weak. Defense lawyers throughout the case attempted to discredit <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, who testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution. `` <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> has committed more crimes than he has fingers on his hands and toes on his feet,'' declared defense attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. Upon hearing the verdict, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 49, said he felt as if 500 pounds had been lifted from his shoulders. `` I feel wonderful. I was hoping my name would be cleared,'' he said. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> native who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> after participating in the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, is commander of the <LOCATION> Military </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terminal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Jack Dash, Cockney Communist Dockers' Leader, Dies at 82</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON>, the Cockney Communist famous for his role in the strikes that plagued <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s docks, died Thursday, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. He was 82. It declined to give the cause of death. Dash prided himself on being involved in every <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dock strike between 1945 and 1970. A colorful figure and gifted orator, he was much in demand on the lecture circuit after his retirement. Born in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dash </PERSON> was raised as an orphan and left school at 14, becoming a builder, a firefighter and then a docker. Inspired by the novels of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> author <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, he joined the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1936 and devoted the rest of his working life to protecting the pay and jobs of the dockers. The Transport and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to which he belonged barred Communists from holding union office, so Dash operated strictly from the soapbox and became known as `` unofficial king of the docks.'' Although he unswervingly defended the Soviet line, he was a fervent British patriot, always reminding listeners that this country invented the parliamentary and trade union tradition. Dash retired in 1969 and immediately organized a rent strike at his public housing project. He also painted, sculpted, wrote an autobiography and became a tourist guide, showing visitors around the city he loved. `` I'm a bloody <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> chauvinist,'' he would often say. His wife <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> predeceased him. In 1970 Dash told an interviewer what he wanted inscribed on his tombstone: `` Here lies <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON>, `` All he wanted was to separate them from their cash.'' `` Them,'' he hastily added, meant employers.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Thursday <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is `` caught in a vise'' of competing pressures on ethics reform, but he promised action. `` We do have a problem. We have to act. We will act,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a news conference Thursday night, joined that call, saying he hoped both Republicans and Democrats would avoid attacking each other. `` I'd like to shift the gears and move into ethics legislation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said when asked about a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> memo attacking new <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the latest salvo in a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> marked by charges of ethical violations. `` We've got to do better,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The ugliness of the climate is bad.'' But he brushed aside demands from some Democrats that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> resign because of the memo. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that skepticism about public officials is healthy but that `` a danger occurs when skepticism becomes cynicism and mistrust.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> renewed his call for a ban on speaking fees, coupled with a pay raise. But he said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are reluctant to risk the wrath of their constituents by voting themselves raises to make up for losing the fees. One possibility, he said, would be to gradually lower limits on speech fees, known as honoraria, while gradually increasing congressional salaries. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, spoke to a group of reporters in his Capitol office at a time when congressional ethics issues have been brought to the fore by allegations that brought resignation announcements from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. Some of the allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> concerned rules on honoraria, while <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> has been criticized for a private investment deal. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said separate Democratic and Republican task forces in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are studying proposals for ethics reform. But he said, `` It's difficult to act in a situation in which there is no clear consensus.'' `` We hope in the near future to be able to go forward with some effort'' in the areas of banning speech fees, known as honoraria, and raising pay, he said. But he also said, `` If prevailing public sentiment were the sole determining factor, the pay of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today would be exactly what it was 200 years ago.'' `` One of the things we must do ... is find the proper balance between being responsive to the wishes of the electorate and applying one's best conscience and judgment as to what is best for the nation or the state as a whole.'' `` We are caught in a vise between tremendous attention devoted to honoraria, in the press ... and a public wholly disinterested in honoraria. It puts members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> squarely in a vise, squarely in a difficult position. We are caught in a vise.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s comments amplified remarks made a day earlier by <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who told reporters he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would act before year's end on a new ethics package <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also said proposals would likely have to address the honoraria issue. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> voiced interest in a bill, introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., which would phase out speaking fees while gradually phasing in increases in lawmakers salaries `` Several senators, both Democrat and Republican, have expressed to me that that's the only reasonable approach ... which some feel is the way out of a difficult situation,'' he said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> currently are paid $ 89,500 a year, although the top leaders make more than that. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by overwhelming margins, defeated a proposed 50 percent pay raise early this year after a public outcry greeted the proposal. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he would not set any `` arbitrary deadline'' for recommending ethics changes, saying it was more important to find agreement on rules that provide `` more precise and definite standards'' for lawmakers. He said a review also is needed of rules concerning acceptance of gifts. He said he thought the increased press scrutiny of congressional ethics was legitimate but also said he does n't think there has been a general deterioration in standards of behavior. `` There has never been a time in history when there has been a total absence of public skepticism about public officials,'' he said, adding that that is `` a healthy thing'' in a democracy. `` There is nothing new here. There is a recurring theme in American history. Of course it is episodic,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. ` We're in one of those periods when interest is high ... A danger occurs when the healthy skepticism becomes cynicism and mistrust.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` must address'' the questions of ethics reform and changes in campaign finance laws, aimed at lessening the influence of special interests. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, began circulating among <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members a letter demanding that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ask for the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> because of a party document which attacked Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> memo compared <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s record with that of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was said to be `` disgusted'' with the incident, but he also expressed confidence in <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who was his 1988 campaign chairman. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, a Republican official who had been a press aide in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, claimed sole responsibility for the letter and resigned. `` These things do n't happen in a political party unless the chief signs off on it,'' said <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fails to get rid of <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, it will hurt the president's credibility when he asks for bipartisan cooperation, he said. But the president, recalling a conversation with <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> about the memo, said: `` He looked me right in the eye and said he did not know about it and and I respect that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had been done `` a terrible ill service by this'' and likened the attack to those made against former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, whose nomination by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be defense secretary was doomed by accusations about Tower's drinking and womanizing. `` I have great respect for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and he's the one who says the matter should be closed and he's right,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in calling for an end to the partisan warfare. `` Let met just repeat: It was disgusting. It's against everything that I've stood for in political life.''

 Thousands of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents bowed before a memorial of bouquets and banners Thursday to mourn fellow ethnic Chinese killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> official said the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may delay settlement of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict. The East German government issued a statement supporting the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's use of force to crush the protest movement. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> expressed concern about the loss of life but said the crackdown is an internal affair. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, nineteen long-robed Taoist mystics prayed and thousands of people spent part of the Dragon Boat holiday Thursday, bowing three times before the makeshift memorial set up outside the Chinese government-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Many wiped away tears. Led by a band playing flutes, drums and cymbals, the mystics beseeched the spirits of those killed by troops in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to rise again from the netherworld. Eighteen men in saffron robes were led by a white-robed priest. Xinhua functions as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s de facto embassy in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a capitalist British colony filled with increasing fear over its reversion to Chinese rule in 1997. <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jete </PERSON> <PERSON> Sucharitkhul </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> government was `` very concerned'' about developments in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where pro-democracy protests since mid-April escalated until troops killed hundreds of people last weekend. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a principal player in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as the main backer of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of the three-party guerrilla coalition opposing the pro-Vietnamese government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. `` Usually the -LRB- Chinese -RRB- government follows the party line, if there is a power struggle you can imagine that they will be very busy internally and not be able to pay as much attention to the -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- issue as they have in the past,'' <PERSON> Jete </PERSON> said. But he said he did not think apparent divisions in the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership would change <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Thursday that Philippine-Chinese relations remain unaffected and her country's embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> will stay open despite plans to evacuate Filipino civilians But a Filipino senator said protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> patterned their protest on the `` People Power'' movement that swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power in 1986 and that the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government should join others in condemning the killings.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Thursday that the evacuation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has gone well and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the work of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador for helping Americans there. `` Some have suggested that to show our forcefulness that I bring the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> -RRB- back. I disagree with that 180 degrees,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at his first prime-time news conference of his presidency. The president insisted that his decision to leave the <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was more productive than recalling him to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> just to show <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> displeasure. Calling <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> `` our very able ambassador,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pointed out that he had played a key role in helping win the release of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who had been caught up in the Tiananmen Square disturbances and held by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities overnight. `` We have seen in the last few days a very good reason to have him there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended as appropriate the sanctions he announced on Monday, suspension of military aid, in response to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military's masscre of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. But the president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not return to `` totally normal relations'' with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> unless that government recognizes the validity of the pro-democracy movement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said economic sanctions would be `` counterproductive and would hurt the people.'' The president added, however, that if the situation does not improve he would take further steps `` at an appropriate time.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the U.S.-Chinese relationship has suffered `` a tragic step backward,'' but stressed that economic ties should be maintained to foster democratic reforms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, reported that all Americans who had gotten to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s airport had been flown out of the country. `` We're keeping our fingers crossed,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said of the evacuation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependents of diplomatic personnel, which he ordered a day earlier after diplomatic compounds in the capital were strafed by gunfire. The secretary had also appealed to private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens to leave the country as soon as possible. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that a power struggle appeared to be underway in the wake of the Sunday massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators and that the situation was still `` too clouded'' to tell exactly who is in charge. He called the bloody massacre of the Chinese protesters `` tragic and deplorable.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also defended the decision to offer refuge to the Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, who is in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with his wife and son. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of interfering in its domestic affairs by harboring the astrophysicist, who had been prevented from attending a dinner with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the president's visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in February. The secretary said he would not discuss whether <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> has sought asylum, but noted that the dissident `` asked for refuge and we granted that refuge.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made a point of saying that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has worked hard to improve ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since relations were formalized in 1979. `` We've spent many years in improving relations between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in encouraging the movement towards democracy,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, adding, `` We've had a very tragic step backward.'' It is vital, he said, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` recognize the importance of this relationship.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intended to take additional steps against the Chinese beyond cutting military sales and freezing military exchanges, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the president `` reserved the right to review all options.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has determined that it's important that we maintain the economic relationships that exist now,'' adding that recent turmoil appeared to be due to the fact that economic reforms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were more advanced than political changes. `` Those economic reforms are what led to the opening up that we saw before this recent tragic and unfortunate and deplorable crackdown,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, adding, `` We think it's important that we maintain, ... depending upon the future course of events there, ... these economic ties because those are the things that for the most part have led to a move toward openness.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> against criticism that not enough was being done to aid Americans leaving the country. <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> and his team have been `` extraordinarly responsive'' to the needs of Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, adding that not one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen had been killed in the violence and that only one had been injured. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> pointed out that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has chartered commercial aircraft to fly to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to supplement regular <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline departures. Also, officials have organized convoys to help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens get to the airports. He cited <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> airlines for being `` quick to respond'' to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request for help. On Wednesday <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> ordered the 258 dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government personnel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to leave, and urged other Americans throughout the country to leave as well. That step came after troops sprayed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> diplomatic compounds with gunfire. Also, reports from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have indicated that disturbances had spread to more than a dozen provincial cities. Some 8,800 Americans had notified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in January that they were in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Later Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shub </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had reported it knew of 115 Americans with official ties still in the city. That includes 11 non-diplomats, one of them the ambassador's wife, plus other dependents, people who work in the embassy and two children whose parents are both members of the diplomatic staff, <PERSON> Shub </PERSON> said The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated that there are some 5,000 private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens left in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and 400 to 500 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, including a number of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students who have refused to leave their univerity campuses in the capital city.

 A tugboat skipper convicted of trying to smuggle 56 tons of hashish and marijuana through the Golden Gate was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is a `` criminal profiteer'' without any redeeming qualities who deserved to be put behind bars for life in the toughest penitentiary the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> could find. Prior to the sentencing, a belligerent <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told the judge, `` When you put that chain around my ankle you'll be putting it around your own neck.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 47, who acted as his own lawyer during the trial, received the maximum sentence, including a $ 4 million fine. In February, a jury found <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> guilty of six charges connected to his 1988 attempt to float hashish and marijuana valued at $ 175 million into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> behind the welded panels of a barge. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> described the drug haul as the largest of its kind in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history _ `` enough dosage units for a -LRB- drug -RRB- hit for every man, woman and child in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The prosecutor said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> deserved the maximum because of the enormity of the drug haul, that he had brought eight members of his family into his `` criminal enterprise, that he has a criminal record going back to his teens, and that he tried twice to escape custody.'' `` There are no drugs,'' shouted <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> in reply. `` That's a bunch of malarkey. I have n't been engaged in any criminal conduct. ... I did n't drag my family into this. ... I'm being persecuted.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told the judge he meant his earlier `` chain'' remark figuratively in that he regarded the sentence as a miscarriage of justice and both he and the judge were therefore victims. The judge said he regarded it as a threat.

 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> study released Thursday suggests that federal officials may be significantly underestimating the number of Americans with AIDS and that there are more whites and fewer blacks with the disease than previously believed. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laumann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said that estimates by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> of the numbers of AIDS case are distorted because affluent whites can afford to be treated discreetly by physicians who do not report the disease. He said in a telephone interview that there also are cases that are not reported due to bureaucratic problems that slow the count or misfile cases. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> makes its estimate based on cases reported to official agencies. An undercount or a failure to report cases could seriously affect the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimate, said <PERSON> Laumann </PERSON>. `` We are contending that there is an undercount, but we do n't know the scale of it,'' said <PERSON> Laumann </PERSON>, who co-authored a report appearing Friday in the journal Science `` We can estimate the demographic composition, but not the gross numbers themselves. The reason we're being cautious is that this is too small a sample.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, questioned about the need for mandatory reporting of new AIDS cases, said he would not favor any type of reporting that would jeopardize the patient's right to privacy. `` There's a lot of suffering, a lot of human tragedy out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding that anything less than `` absolutely discreet handling'' would not be helpful in fighting the AIDS epidemic. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, answering questions at a televised news conference Thursday night, said that people should be encouraged to talk to their doctors frankly about AIDS. To gather data for the AIDS study, <PERSON> Laumann </PERSON> and his associates conducted interviews of 1,481 households around the country. The households were selected to reflect a cross section of the population. Each respondent was asked if he knew an acquaintance who had AIDS. To validate the accuracy of the answers, the respondents also were asked if they had an acquaintance who had been murdered. Earlier studies had proven that response to the homicide survey accurately reflected the actual number of murders. This suggested that answers to the AIDS question would be equally accurate. The results, said the study, `` suggest that the white proportion -LRB- of AIDS cases -RRB- is substantially higher than <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reports and that a substantially greater share of the cases is in the midwestern region.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> figures from March 7, whites compose about 60 percent of the nation's AIDS cases. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> study said the correct number is 72 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said that 26 percent of all cases are black and 14 percent are Hispanic. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> results estimate these totals as 18 percent for blacks, and 6 percent for Hispanics. Cases in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, make up only 8 percent of the national total. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> study said that <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> cases actually compose 20 percent of the national total. The comparative figures for other regions: _ East <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, 39 percent of the national total; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 19 percent. _ South <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, 26 percent; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 25 percent. _ West <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, 27 percent; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 36 percent. <PERSON> Laumann </PERSON> said that `` logic alone'' suggested something wrong with the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> figures for the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he said, `` has all of the AIDS risk factors,'' such as a population of injection drug users, and yet the city was said to have only 3.1 cases of AIDS per 10,000 residents, compared to a national total of 3.7 cases per 10,000. Also, he said, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> figures, `` <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> at the time of the 1988 survey had an absolute number of AIDS cases that was equal to or even exceeded that of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> has 38 percent of the population of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Laumann </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> also has big cities where the AIDS risk factors are common. `` That just does n't make sense,'' he said. <PERSON> Laumann </PERSON> submitted the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> study to officials at the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> for comment, and he said `` these results do n't surprise them.'' `` They know that sexually transmitted diseases are generally undercounted for the white population because people go to personal physicians and one of their things they are doing is buying some discretion about it,'' he said. He said cases were undercounted in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> because of a flawed system of data collection by official agencies, noting `` there's been a scandal for sometime about the AIDS office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and how inadequate it was.'' <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, a spokesperson for the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said there were no officials available to comment on the new study. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is fatal disease caused by a virus that is spread most frequently by sexual intercourse or by the sharing of needles among intravenous drug users. Through the month of April, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reports that AIDS had been diagnosed in 94,280 Americans, of whom more than half, or 53,544, have died since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. Science, which reported the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> study, is the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday urged Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> demonstrate `` his desire for change'' by responding positively and quickly to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals to cut conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I think he has already demonstrated his commitment to change and to reform,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an evening news conference, declaring, `` I want to see perestroika succeed ... not fail.'' Earlier in the day, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the administration hope <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will respond to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal when he visits <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> next week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also extended a hand of friendship and congratulations to the people <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> who, in the first democratic elections there since World War II, gave a resounding vote of no confidence in the Communist government. The president said that when he travels to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next month, he will tell its leaders that, `` We want to work with you.'' `` The quest for democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> ... if it goes forward, will mean a much better relationship for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Soviet leader has already demonstrated that `` he is interested in new thinking,'' one of the elements of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or restructuring `` But there's ways now to solidify these changes,'' said the president, urging <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer to cut its 305,000 troops in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 if the Soviets cut their 600,000 troops to that level as well. `` What is wrong with being equal?'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` So here's a test now.'' The president acknowledged that some disagreements remained between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over whether to modernize <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> short-range nuclear missiles, but said a conventional forces agreement could solve that problem. `` It is in our interests to quickly move forward, because if we can get implemented within our time frame the agreement on conventional forces, that will take a tremendous amount of pressure off the Germans on short-range forces,'' said the president. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that Soviet acceptance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to reduce <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces to the same level `` would substantially reduce the threat of surprise military attack and the danger of large-scale offensive operations against <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` The time is ripe for Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to respond positively to the opportunities presented by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s initiatives,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. The secretary of state said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals offer the Soviets the opportunity both to channel resources from the military to the civilian sector and to accelerate the process of political reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Our proposals point clearly to a long-term, dramatic transformation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s strategic and political landscape,'' he said. Answering questions following his prepared remarks, Baker: _ Said officials from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> Thursday, considered `` practical ways'' to achieve a comprehensive <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement based on <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions _ Called for a bipartisan agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a new policy aimed at hastening an end to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system He said a recent statement by South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> that his party's platform for national elections will affirm the need to abolish apartheid is a significant step. _ Declared the administration is `` very hopeful'' that <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> mediators will make progress towards bringing about a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ Indicated he was not impressed by an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> proposal under which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will help free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tries to win freedom for Iranians held by Christian forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided information on the Iranian hostages to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1982.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent was convicted Thursday of using excessive force in arresting a man near a presidential candidate's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> motorcade last year. The 12-member federal jury deliberated six hours before convicting agent <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON>, 28, of using unnecessary and excessive force when he kicked and punched attorney <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorayeb </PERSON>, 32, on April 10, 1988. <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON> was acquitted of falsely arresting <PERSON> Gorayeb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> near the motorcade of Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn. Neither Schatzle nor the 20 or so <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents who crowded the tiny courtroom showed emotion as the verdict was read. Schatzle of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was in the security detail for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, then campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. The agent, who faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine, was released without bail by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leval </PERSON>, who set sentencing for Sept. 13. During the seven-day trial, <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON> testified that the lawyer spit at him, but <PERSON> Gorayeb </PERSON> said he was attacked when he yelled an obscenity at the passing motorcade because one of its cars almost hit him as he legally crossed the street. `` I was kneed so hard in the groin that I was lifted off the ground,'' <PERSON> Gorayeb </PERSON> testified, adding that after he fell to the sidewalk, `` I was beaten, kicked and punched.'' The agent maintained that he was only following standard procedure for subduing a suspect. Seven witnesses testified that they saw the agent beating <PERSON> Gorayeb </PERSON>, who said he suffered a broken nose as well as eye, neck and shoulder injuries. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, special agent-in-charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> field office, said <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON> has not been suspended and his fate with the agency will be decided at a later date.

 But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was firm in his support for the students who are agitating for democracy. `` They're not trying to flee <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They're trying to change <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> was still in charge. `` I'm trying to say that I do n't know. And you do n't know, and he does n't know. She does n't know,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, pointing around the room of reporters. `` Nobody knows, outside -LRB- <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -RRB-. That's the way the Chinese system works ... `` I simply can not tell you with authority who is calling the shots.'' The president was reluctant to directly blame any <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official for the military crackdown and massacre of students, saying, `` I do n't want to pass judgement on individual leaders.'' Pressed on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could have normal relations with anyone responsible for the killings, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` It would make it extraordinarily difficult.'' However, he said the question was `` so hypothetical that I'm going to avoid answering it directly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was disappointed in the course of events since he visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in February. `` Armed people do n't shoot down unarmed students,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the military sanctions he announced on Monday morning, but suggested that if the situation does not improve he would take further steps `` at an appropriate time.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a one-word description for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> circular comparing <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record with that of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a homosexual <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ `` disgusting.'' But he deflected a questioner who asked whether party chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> should be called to account. `` He looked me right in the eye,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of his handpicked GOP boss, `` and said he did not know about it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> `` moved promptly to remove the person who said he did know about it and I respect that.'' <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> communications director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> announced his resignation on Wednesday after saying he had written the material. Of <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the president said, `` He's the one who says the matter should be closed, and he's right.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed eager to drop the subject, and said it was time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adopt tough ethics legislation. The White House said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, since taking office Jan. 20, has had from 16 to 23 news conferences, depending on how you define a news conference. The sessions have ranged in length from just a few minutes to more than 45 minutes. All his previous news conferences were held during the day, and none was conducted in the formal setting of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>. By holding a news conference in television's prime-time hours, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assured himself of a large viewing audience; the major commercial television networks were broadcasting the session. The president personally decided the arrangement of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> for the news conference, changing the setting that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used to make a dramatic entrance, striding down the red-carpeted, marble-columned Cross Hall to reach the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, where reporters sat facing him across the length of the room. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opted for a less regal entrance, from an adjacent state room, with reporters seated on his left as he came into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who had lunch with the president, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ready `` to knock it right out of the ballpark.'' White House officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, unlike <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, did not make extensive preparations for the news conference _ actually his second one this week after Monday's announcement of a freeze in $ 600 million in military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used to study sample questions and hold dress rehearsals at which his staff asked him questions. White House deputy press secretary <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was doing `` nothing special'' other than talking with chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and deputy national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, giving <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a periodic briefing on national security matters. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, during a picture-taking session with visiting Soviet editor <PERSON> Sergey </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ including a suspension of all arms sales but not the imposition of broad commercial sanctions _ `` has good support in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' and that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` feel the president is acting in a prudent and a wise manner.'' In another development, a spokesman for former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on Monday and talked with him about 10 minutes before announcing the steps he was taking in retaliation for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the spokesman, said he had no information on the content of the call. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1972 after years of diplomatic isolation.

 A man and his 16-year-old daughter were killed 11 -LCB- hours apart Thursday in separate accidents involving pickup trucks in which they were passengers, state police said. The truck carrying <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Normalville </LOCATION> apparently was traveling fast when it went out of control at a curve on state Route 1003 at 1:15 p.m., said Trooper <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Regulators to Require Drug, Alcohol Testing of Nuke Plant Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it now requires random drug and alcohol tests of workers at all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear power plants. The rule takes effect July 7 and applies to all plants, whether operating or under construction. Many utilities already conduct random tests for drug and alcohol use by their plant workers, but the commission said it wanted to assure that such testing is uniform. The commission in recent months has expressed concern at increasing evidence that illegal drugs are used by some nuclear plant workers, including reactor operators. The new regulation prohibits the use of alcohol `` prior to and during work'' and also requires plant owners to find ways to contain the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and to address other health problems such as fatigue. The rule requires drug testing of all workers who have security clearances for unescorted access to nuclear plants, as well as random follow-up testing of these workers. Tests for alcohol use are to be performed at the same time. A concentration of alcohol in the blood of 0.04 percent would be considered a violation of the rule. Utilities may adopt even stricter limits if they choose. Some people might show show a concentration after one drink. Many states use 0.10 percent as evidence of drunken driving. Workers who test positive for either alcohol or illegal drugs are to be denied access to protected areas and removed from their work duties. They may return later if they are deemed fit to do so. A second confirmed positive test would mean a work suspension for at least three years. Involvement in the sale, use or possession of illegal drugs by anyone within a secure area of a nuclear plant would mean suspension for at least five years. Any subsequent use of drugs or alcohol would mean permanent suspension. For plant construction sites, the rule requires that utilities seeking their operating licenses implement random drug and alcohol testing and impose sanctions on users.

 Tornadoes ripped through two small towns in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Thursday, destroying more than 30 homes and killing five people. Tornadoes, rain and high wind from thunderstorms also caused damage in parts of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. One twister smashed into the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> early Thursday night, destroying several homes. A mother, her daughter and grandson were killed in one home, officials said. The violent weather began developing along the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, when a man who sought shelter in a metal-roofed shed near <LOCATION> Stapleto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, was killed by lightning. Tornadoes skipped across several <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> parishes early Thursday. One twister struck the small town of <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tete </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, about 6 a.m. Thursday, destroying at least 25 residences and injuring about two dozen people, in addition to the man and woman killed, authorities said. `` We ca n't imagine how more are n't dead,'' <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurdle </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Iberville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jury </ORGANIZATION>, said of the town of 790 people. `` This is devastating. There's about 20 houses that are n't even here anymore. No serious injuries were reported 15 miles away in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, where Fire Chief <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spillman </PERSON> said at least four twisters touched down 19 times, destroying or damaging almost 70 mobile homes and 25 to 30 houses. <PERSON> Spillman </PERSON> estimated that between 400 and 600 people lived in the destroyed or damaged residences. A shelter was set up at a high school for those left homeless. Pieces of mobile homes were strewn in tree tops in <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tete </LOCATION>. About 100 people were evacuated and were put up in emergency shelters, <PERSON> Hurdle </PERSON> said. The storm left the town without electricity, natural gas, water and most telephone service. One elderly woman was rescued from the rubble of her home after rescuers used a power saw to cut through a pile of wood. Dogs were taken to the area to search for more bodies and trapped survivors. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> toured the area by helicopter and Rep. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., said he would seek a federal disaster declaration Over a two-hour period, tornadoes also were reported in the parishes of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tangipahoa </LOCATION>. The early morning tornadoes in southeastern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> followed a night of violent weather in the western and central part of the state in which several homes were destroyed or damaged late Wednesday, but no serious injuries were reported. A line of thunderstorms that pounded the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> produced several tornadoes. One ripped through East Point, about 85 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, at about 7 p.m. EDT. Three houses and three mobile homes were destroyed and two businesses heavily damaged, <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's deputies said. The three people killed were a 16-year-old boy, his mother, 33, and his grandmother, 51. Other tornadoes destroyed a house, damaged a supermarket and knocked down two temporary buildings. At least 6 inches of rain fell at <LOCATION> Milton </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> park ranger suffered a broken arm and cuts Thursday when a tornado destroyed the entrance station at the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pickens </LOCATION> section of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seashore </LOCATION> on the western <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. She was thrown 10 to 15 yards and only the concrete foundation of the station was left, officials said. Another tornado hit <LOCATION> Ellisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, damaging buildings and uprooting trees. Trees and power lines were down across from the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where summer classes were underway, but officials said there was no campus damage as earlier reported. <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said most power in <LOCATION> Ellisville </LOCATION> was restored by early afternoon.

A half-mile section of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 49 near <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, was closed after water gushed around an overloaded culvert and cut a tunnel underneath the two-lane roadbed, <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> resident engineer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> said. The roadbed did not wash out, but a section of pavement about 12 feet long cracked and dropped about 18 inches. Tornadoes touched down in several communities on the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> coast, causing minor injuries and destroying two homes in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, damaging 23 others, and overturning a mobile home in <LOCATION> Robertsdale </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he had seen no change in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s terrorist policies since the death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, and repeated his offer to improve relations if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> helped free <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said, wants `` a change in relations ... We like the Iranian people.'' `` I stated the other day what it would take to have improved relationships, and that would a reunciation of terror,'' he said at a news conference, repeating a statement he made last Monday, two days after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death was announced. `` We ca n't have normalized relations with a state that is branded a terrorist state,'' he said. `` And secondly they must facilitate the release of American hostages. That is what it would take,'' he said. The president noted that the speaker of the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, had said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would use its influence to help free nine American hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Lebanese if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped free Shiites taken by Christian militiamen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> had made a similar offer months ago. `` We supplied them information,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, without offering details. But he said it would take more than a change in rhetoric to improve U.S.-Iranian lessons. `` It is going to take a change in behavior,'' he said. `` We do n't mind name calling. They keep calling us the Great Satan. That does n't bother us ... Performance is what we are looking for.'' `` I do n't see so far any sign of change,'' he said, adding that he had `` held out the olive branch'' in his inaugural speech on Jan. 20. His message to Iranian leaders, then as now, was `` You want better relations, do what's right. Do what's right by people by people who are held against their will. We see no movement. I repeat that offer tonight.''

 A man who searched in 11 states for his two sons was reunited with the boys Wednesday, 9 -LCB- years after their mother took them to a Christmas party and never returned. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> said after meeting with his sons <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>, 12, for the first time since 1979 that the boys were upset and bewildered at being separated from the mother who police say abducted them. The reunion was held Wednesday morning behind closed doors in a state police barracks. Their father, a 34-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Moose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> manager from <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, described the reunion as `` not the happiest. We have lots of things to work out in the next couple of months. But we're going to make it.'' After the boys were turned over to their father, a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge issued a temporary restraining order late Wednesday afternoon saying the boys were to stay in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> until a court hearing Thursday. But before the order could be served on <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON>, he and the boys had boarded a flight from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The boys' mother, <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, allegedly took the two boys and fled <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> with a religious group in 1979 after their father had been awarded custody by a divorce court. The group settled in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> several years ago but moved around to several locations in the state, said Sgt. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lessard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION> on Tuesday on a warrant charging her with child abduction, state police said. <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> was told Tuesday that his children had been found, ending a search in which he said he said he spent more than $ 20,000 and traveled to 11 states. <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> said his sons would not answer questions or comment publicly. He said, `` They ca n't understand why they have to go back to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and why I ca n't come to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to join their church.'' <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> described the church, which went by the name His Community in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> but uses the name <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, as a cult. He said his children had been `` somewhat brainwashed.'' <PERSON> Lessard </PERSON>, in a separate interview, said police did not consider the group a cult. `` We'd rather refer to it as a communal church,'' he said. <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON>'s second wife, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON>, said they learned that the boys had been found Tuesday morning. `` We've either been in police stations or on planes or at home packing since then.'' Ms. <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, 34, faced a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution as well as the state charge, for which she was ordered held under $ 75,000 bail pending extradition to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> said that when his estranged wife abducted the chilren, `` the whole -LRB- church -RRB- group, about 100 people, up and left town on a single day.'' <PERSON> Lessard </PERSON> said the church group included some children, but that <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON>'s was the only case in which the children left against the will of the person who had custody. His Community was founded by Roman Catholics in the <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, area as a Bible study group in the 1970s, said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, who worked with the group at its early meetings. Protestants joined in, and the group evolved into a cult with strong leadership, said <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>. `` They decided to leave. They were going to be the new exodus from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said.

 Deep inside <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, the military's nuclear detection force uses outdated equipment to protect the nation from attack. Officials say a $ 1.3 billion upgrading now under way will not be completed for years. Green phosphor radar monitors, surplus from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, were designed back in the 1950s to track airplanes, not to monitor the globe for missiles, according to those who use them. They call the washing-machine-size monitors `` green monsters.'' Nearby is the phone they would use to contact the president in the event of a nuclear attack. It's wired downstairs through an old-fashioned plug-in switchboard. `` There's a lot of antiquated stuff at <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, there's no doubt about it,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Oborn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman The facility was built in 1957. More than 693,000 tons of granite were removed from <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> to make way for 15 buildings housing 700 people. They work behind 30-ton blast doors 1,400 feet inside the mountain. The <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> complex, built at a cost of $ 142 million, was originally designed to track airplanes that could launch a nuclear attack against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. When the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> entered the space age, monitoring missile launches became an added duty. The facility has been criticized by both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its watchdog agency, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, for failure to keep pace with technology, for project delays and for cost overruns. Although the center's airplane tracking computer has been improved, the updating of three other computers used to track submarines, missiles and some 7,000 objects floating in space will not be finished until at least 1994. Methods used to gather the raw tracking data used at <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> are classified, but it is known that some information comes from satellites, some from intelligence sources, including spies, wiretaps and monitored radio conversations, and much from ground-based equipment. Work on updating <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> is proceeding slowly because of mistakes made in the past, said Col. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doss </PERSON>, director of missile warning for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees operations at <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The switchboard will eventually give way to a modern communications system. The green monsters _ where missiles and subs show up as green dots on dinner-plate-size screens _ are to be replaced with multi-color displays. The center's aircraft trackers are already using the new equipment to follow as many as 50 planes at a time on a screen; where they were once represented by a jumble of green numbers, the aircraft now are categorized by color. `` You can look at the green friendlies and the red unknowns,'' said a Canadian officer in charge one recent day at the joint U.S.-Canadian tracking center. `` I can look at a screen and get five times the amount of information'' as with the old `` 1950s technology,'' he said. Replacing the communications system is estimated to cost $ 255 million. Replacing the display system will cost $ 268 million, and putting in a survivable communications integration system will cost $ 135 million. The project to replace the computer system to track satellites is already over budget, behind schedule and ca n't perform many of the functions required, according to a new <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report. The system was originally expected to cost $ 290 million, but will now cost $ 437 million. The system was supposed to be operating by June 1988, but wo n't be completed until 1994, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The military is even planning a backup center, in case <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> were destroyed. Construction began in April on the underground facility at <ORGANIZATION> Offutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. On a recent day in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, a team of military officers monitored the flights of two Soviet Bear Delta bombers off the coast of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. The planes, on a routine patrol, were are not considered a threat. These trackers have two minutes to identify an aircraft that enters <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airspace. If it is not identified, they scramble jet fighters. Now, by pointing a `` mouse,'' or computer pointer, at the dot representing a particular plane or submarine, the trackers can see its latitude, longitude, designation, and other details. With the old system, planes and subs could only be tracked with paper and pencil. In a room deeper inside the mountain, an officer using a green monster kept track of three Soviet submarines in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>; they showed up as dots with their classification beside them indicating they were capable of carrying nuclear ballistic missiles. Another officer tracked the Soviets' unmanned MIR space station over <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The sub and missile monitoring area, using satellites with infrared cameras, is at the heart of <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>'s operation, the command post. The trackers work in a temporary facility, slightly larger than the average living room, while a new $ 178 million command center is being built next door. To their right are the battle stations, each with red telephones for officers who would help direct <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear war. When the Soviets launch a missile, the front door of the command center is locked tight. There are no klaxon horns, just the beep-beep-beep of the command network telephone alerting all points that a missile is airborne. The launch shows up as a triangle on a green monster, with the fan of the triangle showing the missile's general direction. The commander in chief of <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> is notified, and he stays on the phone until the missile is considered safe. In these days of detente, the Soviets usually give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities advance notice of launches. Intelligence officials pass the word to <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, but sometimes the officers keep it a secret to see how their trackers perform. In 1979, a technician placed a training tape with missile warning events into a newly installed computer tracking system, and the command center thought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was under attack and went on alert, <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Later that year, it happened again when a computer chip failed and began feeding erroneous information into the system, officials reported. As that system is replaced, Col. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouts </PERSON>, director of space defense and surveillance, said he hopes to avoid the mistakes that were made installing it all at once instead of in segments. Another problem then was that some of the computers could not exchange information, as needed, <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Despite <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> criticism of the new system, <PERSON> Doss </PERSON> defended it and said he is trying to do something that has never been done with computers before: save money by using equipment off the shelf rather than getting it specially designed. `` Unfortunately, cost is a factor here. I have to worry about it every day,'' he said.

<HEAD>India Building Military Might</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With the vast <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to its south and uneasy neighbors to its north, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is building up its military might. `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is a mini superpower in the making,'' a Western military expert said. Its array of weapons includes a nuclear-powered submarine, aircraft carriers, MiG-29 fighter planes and recently acquired medium-range ballistic missile capability. Indian and Western military analysts say the country is developing a power projection well beyond the Asian Subcontinent. The nation of 880 million people has 1.36 million men in uniform, the world's fourth-largest force in terms of manpower after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 115,000-man air force with 870 planes ranks behind only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the crucial field of heavy combat airlift capability. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also has been one of the world's largest arms importers since 1986. More than 25,000 scientists and engineers are working in 15 laboratories and 60 research centers on hundreds of major weapons, electronics and other defense-related developments. The government is spending $ 1 billion a year on research and developments projects alone. `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is developing such a military might, especially in the air force and <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, that it is amounting to giving notices to superpowers that their roles in the region are subject to check,'' said the Western military expert, who represents a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and would speak only on conditiion of anonymity. On May 22, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> successfully test-fired its first-medium range ballistic missile, becoming only the seventh nation in the world with the demonstrated ability to make its own ballistic missiles. The 1.2 million-man army is adding four new divisions to the existing 34 _ an increase of 80,000 combat soldiers. Indigenous weapons already tested or under development include light combat aircraft, pilotless aircraft, cluster bombs, high-altitude parachutes, light field guns, main battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, advanced panoramic sonar to detect enemy submarines, variable depth sonar, homing torpedoes, anti-submarine electric torpedoes, mines and mine-breaching equipment and a new range of small arms and wheeled vehicles. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is also building a superport in the southern state of <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> for developing submarines and ships, including its own 30,000-ton aircraft carrier. A long-range reconnaissance aircraft, capable of patrolling as far as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is in the planning stage. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is the only country outside the Soviet bloc to have acquired the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s latest MiG-29 fighters. Negotiations are under way to build MiG-29s in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s two aircraft carriers give the 53,000-man navy a constantly available fixed-wing seaborne air power. `` Given the vast coastline -LRB- 3,525 miles -RRB- the naval strength is not much, but at least we have a blue-water navy now,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be identified. `` Our aim is to be self-sufficient. We are not gearing our armed forces for battle. It is just the opposite. We believe all these will work as deterrents.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has fought three wars with neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. But its biggest rival in the region is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with whom it fought a border war in 1962 and lost territory. The Indian navy has 14 submarines, including a nuclear-powered sub leased from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and it is trying to lease three more nuclear-powered subs from the Soviets. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s most recent achievement was the test firing of the medium-range Agni missile, named for the Hindu fire god. The missile has a range of 1,550 miles, capable of reaching <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the east and as far west as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The two-stage rocket can deliver a one-ton payload _ enough to carry a nuclear warhead, according to Indian military experts. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago but insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Western military experts say, however, Indian scientists could assemble a nuclear warhead in a week's time. The Agni test capped a missile development program that started in 1983. However, the Western military expert said it would be years before <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> could put its capabilities to use. `` It is one thing to develop something, but another to use it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Elks Facing Challenges To All-Male, Virtually All-White Membership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 For more than a century, the <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> club has chosen the kind of members it believes stand for the American ideals of equality, charity and brotherhood. For all that time, almost all of them have been white men. Even in cities as racially diverse as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Elks lodges remain the preserve of the white male, with written rules that ban women and voting procedures that critics say stack the deck against blacks. But that may be changing, according to civil libertarians and legal experts, because of recent challenges to the membership practices of the 121-year-old Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. Several <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lodges have threatened to go to court if they are unsuccessful in persuading the national organization at its convention next month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to change voting rules to admit more black members. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> attorney general's office is investigating possible civil rights violations by a <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> lodge that rejected two black applicants. And a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> woman rejected for membership in a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> lodge has filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against the Elks club. Elks leaders have strongly defended the club against all challenges, contending that members have a constitutional right to associate with whomever they choose. But legal experts say that the Elks will be held to the same civil rights laws the courts have applied to the Rotary club and other organizations. Ultimately, they say, the <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to change their ways. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has been very clear that it is not at all solicitous and protective of groups that want to discriminate,'' said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chemerinsky </PERSON>, law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on civil rights litigation. `` I'm sure that would include the Elks.'' The accusations of racism and sexism and the prospect of change in membership have rattled Elks leaders and tarnished the reputation of the 1.6 million-member group. `` Why's everybody picking on the Elks?'' asks spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yothers </PERSON>. `` I wish somebody would tell the true story, the good side of the Elks club.'' The Elks project an image as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> as the flag, its members donating their time and money to everything from rodeos to pancake breakfasts. The club raised $ 53 million last year for charity nationally. Critics say the true story is actually an unusual mixture of charity and discrimination. For most of its history, the Elks explicitly limited membership to white men. In 1973, the bylaws were changed to include all men, but women still were banned and voting rules that gave great power to a small group of members has effectively kept out blacks. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, for example, the 13 Elks lodges have more than 9,000 members, none of them women, none of them black, and only a smattering of them Asian and Hispanic, according to lodge officials, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. One lodge exalted ruler said he was unaware of the change in rules to allow black members. His lodge has never had one. Critics find it ironic that lodge members who are willing to raise money for charitable groups serving black children are unwilling to share a drink in the lodge with a black businessman. College-bound girls are given Elks scholarships, but college-educated women ca n't join the lodge. `` It just makes you feel a little disappointed that this sort of thing could be happening in this day and age,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, 57, a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> housing official who was one of the two blacks rejected this year by the lodge in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The other was <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 56, a Realtor. The two have been told that fewer than a dozen lodge members cast `` no'' votes by placing black marbles into the voting box. Even though nearly 140 members supported them, Elks voting rules require only three black marbles to reject, or blackball, an applicant. `` I truly felt deep down in my heart that they would accept me,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` But it is just a few bad apples. I feel more pity for those people than anger at my situation.'' The rejection of <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, two longtime residents with many friends in the community and lodge, outraged the city of 31,000. The newspaper printed angry editorials, the school board refused to accept <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> scholarships, and a boycott of Elks functions was in the works. Just last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted to block donations from a local lodge, part of <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>'s region, to city-sponsored youth programs In late March, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> confirmed that the state was investigating the lodge for possible violations of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s civil rights law, the same law the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld in ordering the Rotary club to admit women. Under community pressure, the <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> lodge and others in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> passed a resolution to urge the national Grand Lodge to change voting procedures to a two-thirds majority. If the national organization balks, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lodges plan to go to court with the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sure we're concerned'' about opposing the Grand Lodge, said <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Simas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> leader. `` But we are willing to go against the national lodge.'' While the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lodges prepare to challenge the voting rules, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, continues to battle her local lodge, with a lot less fanfare, for the right to become a member. Ms. <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON>, a construction company manager denied membership in 1987, contends the <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> club is violating state liquor laws banning discrimination in most places that serve alcoholic beverages by the glass. Her suit is pending. `` The local Elks lodge in this state is one of few places where people can conduct business over a cocktail at lunch or a drink after work,'' said her attorney, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>. `` By excluding women, the <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> have denied a large segment of society of the right to develop business contacts.'' The challenges to the Elks membership practices in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> have rankled national Elks leaders. <PERSON> Yothers </PERSON> denies that racism was at work in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, noting that no member of that lodge has admitted blackballing the two black applicants because of their race. However, he acknowledged that if they did make such an admission they would face expulsion from the lodge. He also said it was illogical to admit women to the <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> club, which he calls a fraternal organization similar to a college fraternity. `` You do n't let women in fraternities, and you do n't let males in sororities. This whole thing just does n't make sense.''

 For nearly 20 years, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> has been one of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s top experts on redistricting, drawing the maps and crunching the numbers to help the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> win <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats. But <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> has also used his skills to help Hispanics in local reapportionment battles in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and other states, sometimes benefitting Democratic politicians. Now the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> activist is reportedly at the top of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list of nominees to head the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, evoking strong reactions from some Democrats worried he might tinker with the 1990 Census `` A political hit man'' is what <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> called <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON>, adding he `` has always been a very political operator.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters the appointment of <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> would `` guarantee an under-count of blacks and Hispanics,'' which <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said `` would be an absolute disaster for Democrats.'' <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> was chief reapportionment consultant to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republicans following the 1970 census. He has maintained professional and social contact with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders since he left <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> in 1973 to establish the <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Claremont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKenna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON>, a 51-year-old Oxford-educated British immigrant, is so publicity-shy that a reader has to search the fine print to even find his name in the 34-page annual report of the <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> refused all public comment since his name surfaced for the Census post _ except for a response to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` No one is more concerned than I am with ensuring an accurate census count,'' <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> said, adding that `` to engage in some sort of rebuttal of statements made by <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> about a position that has not yet been offered to me is nonsense.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s judgment of <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> is not universal. `` <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was intemperate, unfair and just plain wrong ... instead of trying to undercount minorities, <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> has sought ways of increasing their representation on lawmaking bodies,'' said political editor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>. Many <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrats have declined comment on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s charges, with few willing to disagree with the powerful Assembly speaker on the record `` <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON>'s not Attila the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON>, and he's certainly not a racist,'' one <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat said on the condition his name not be used. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> reapportionment consultant who is head of research for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> is `` eminently qualified'' for the Census post. `` He has spent a lot of time on demographic issues. <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> knows the West and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> in particular, and he has worked closely with minorities,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. Some Democrats have read Machiavellian motives into <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON>'s assistance to minority political activists They contend that designing districts to put more minority politicians in office undercuts Democratic attempts to spread the heavy Democratic majorities of minority neighborhoods over more districts. That view is disputed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Santillan </PERSON>, a Hispanic activist who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>. `` That's an invalid argument. Greater minority representation is going to help, not hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. What it may be undermining is the entrenched white leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but it's not undermining the party,'' <PERSON> Santillan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Santillan </PERSON> added he `` always had suspicions that the Rose Institute was a Republican front'' _ before he met <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON>. `` In 10 years working with him, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> has never overtly or subtly tried to slant our research or inhibit it,'' <PERSON> Santillan </PERSON> said. `` There are people who produce statistics to help one party or the other, but <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> has never done that.'' `` Politically, I'm exactly opposite of <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> ... If he becomes the census director, he will look to the Latino community, to the black community and to the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> community for input, and it will be meaningful input,'' <PERSON> Santillan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Local Government is part of <ORGANIZATION> Claremont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKenna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a private college with 840 students that is one of six related colleges sharing a single suburban campus about 30 miles east of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> serves as head of the political science department and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which is located in a former psychology lab on the campus. It receives no subsidy from the college and operates as a non-profit, self-supporting think tank. The institute has spent more than $ 1.5 million over the past dozen years to build the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Data </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, which has computerized 126 categories of political, economic and other demographic data on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 5,000 census tracts and 26,000 voting precincts. `` No one else, at least this side of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, has managed to combine political demographic data with advanced techniques of computer analysis to the extent that we have,'' <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> said in a 1984 interview. The institute has received grants from businesses and foundations and has had contracts with political, governmental and business groups to conduct studies, use its database or host seminars. The institute's 1988 annual report lists among its paying clients both the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidential campaigns, the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and businesses ranging from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>. The most controversial incident in the institute's history was a $ 700,000 project, financed by a group of corporate executives known as the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Roundtable, to develop a `` model reapportionment plan'' for legislative and congressional districts following the 1980 census. <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON> insisted that the plan was intended to be a nonpartisan yardstick for use in evaluating the plans produced by the Legislature. Democrats denounced it as a sham to promote <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and conservative efforts.

<HEAD>A Literary Dame Turns to the Theater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> easily envisions the public for her novels: `` It's the chap sitting by the window reading, or possibly rereading, the book.'' Plays, however, are a different matter. `` Why do people go to the theater?'' she asks. `` Why do n't they stay home?'' The comparisons spring readily to mind for <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> whose new play, `` The Black Prince,'' is well into its <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> run. The drama, which opened April 25 at the Aldwych Theater, marks the third West End play from the erstwhile philosophy professor and author of more than 20 novels, beginning with `` Under the Net'' in 1954 through to the award-winning 1978 `` The Sea, the Sea'' and `` The Book and the Brotherhood'' last year. Adapted from her 1973 novel of the same name, `` The Black Prince'' casts <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McDiarmid </PERSON>, long a mainstay of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, as a tax assessor named <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> who nurses ambitions to be a great writer. The `` black prince'' of the title refers to the Greek muse Apollo, whom <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> invokes as the God of poetry and music. But the play itself is specifically steeped in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, particularly `` Hamlet,'' a play which <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> exalts as `` a monument of words ... a wild act of audacity.'' The writing swings from black comedy to tragedy in a surreal finish that suggests her Czech forbear, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>. It's among <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s weightier, more highbrow nights out, and <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> acknoweldged being uneasy about how long it will survive. `` One does want a period of exposure,'' she said in an interview. She was encouraged to adapt the novel to the stage by her producer <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, wife of the advertising executive <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>. `` I was interested, naturally,'' she said. `` It's jolly lonely being a novelist; it's occasionally a great pleasure to work in the theater.'' She said a play is a totally different object from a novel. `` It's much more like a poem; one's got to pack in a great deal of action and passion and explication,'' she said. `` Every single line matters; every word matters.'' Whereas theater profits from an economy of word and gesture, novels can be more expansive, and <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>' works have been likened to the rangy, large-scale fiction of such 19th-century English and Russian writers as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostoevsky </PERSON>. Such comparisons delight her. `` In a humble way, I feel very much I belong to that tradition of the novel,'' said the author, who was made a Dame by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in 1987. `` They are great sources of power. So are men like <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, and I'm very attached to -LRB- <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> -RRB- Proust.'' Her novels exert their own mysterious power, with their alternately satiric and comic depictions of the witty and well-educated English tumbling into infidelities, improprieties, and violence: murder in `` The Book and the Brotherhood''; suicide in `` The Nice and the Good'' and `` The Good Apprentice.'' `` The Black Prince'' itself encompasses several deaths, alongside lengthy ruminations about the function of art and the nature of illusion versus reality. `` If you write a story dealing with conflicts of interest, you encounter forms of violence of various sorts,'' explained <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, adding that she does not regard violence as any `` particular oddity.'' Her blueprint for novel-writing involves `` some quite complicated knot involving some character, or a problem.'' `` I think the imagination just works out of the darkness. One has to sit and wait.'' The Irish-born daughter of a civil servant, she moved to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with her parents as a baby. Oxford-educated, she lives in the university city today with her husband of 33 years, English professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> neither courts nor shuns publicity, preferring to stick to a daily routine: writing with a pen _ she loathes word processors _ in the morning, followed by shopping and housework in the afternoon. Her husband cooks the evening meal. Her next novel, `` The Message to the Planet,'' will be published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Oct. 2 and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early next year. While she claims to have `` forgotten'' what it's about, she feels her craft is improving. `` My books have got longer, but I also think they've got better. If one goes on practicing a craft, up to a certain point one gets better,'' she said. `` Art is very much a matter of courage and confidence, too, not just ability.''

<HEAD>Savings Bonds Keep Up With The Times</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In their search for a hip investment for the sophisticated 1990s, some advisers are putting aside their computers and their calculators and recommending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds. Why such an old plain-vanilla idea when so many newer and more exotic flavors are available? Well, for one thing, recent changes in the tax laws that drastically altered many money management strategies left savings bonds unscathed. They are no way to get rich fast, and they never will be. But they are versatile, practical and safe. Perhaps best of all, they offer some measure of protection against just about any foreseeable financial misfortune, whether the economy gets too hot or too cold. `` Whether saving for college or retirement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government Series EE savings bonds offer an attractive ` tax-sheltered' investment for people at any income level,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, editor of the newsletter Financial Planning Reporter published by the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whinney </LOCATION> `` Their variable interest rate, with a 6 percent floor, provides a double-edged sword with which to fight either inflation or deflation.'' Furthermore, say analysts at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the firm's weekly publication <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outlook </ORGANIZATION>, `` just now, with interest rates drifting lower, Series EE savings bonds have special appeal because they lock in yields for six months at a stretch.'' The savings bond program, revamped in 1982, has operated for decades on a system similar to the one adopted for modern vehicles known as zero-coupon bonds. They are sold, in denominations as small as $ 50 and as large as $ 10,000, for half their face value. They provide no current cash distributions, but instead appreciate gradually in value as interest on them accumulates and compounds. Provided that you hold them for at least five years, the government guarantees an annual interest rate of 6 percent, or 85 percent of the yield available on five-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, whichever is higher. The variable rate, recalculated each May 1 and Nov. 1, currently stands at 7.81 percent through Oct. 31, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> notes. Savings bonds' `` tax shelter'' is twofold. As the interest on them builds up, you can choose not to pay any federal income tax on the interest until you cash in a bond. In addition, savings bond interest, like that of other securities of the federal government, is exempt from state and local income taxes. With bonds bought any time starting Jan. 1 of next year, there will be an extra kicker. You can avoid any tax at all if you use the proceeds from them to pay for education expenses such as college tuition and your adjusted gross income on your tax return is $ 60,000 or less for a married couple, $ 40,000 or less for single filers. Savings bonds bought before next year do n't qualify for this special treatment. However, suggests <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's, if you are holding older bonds in a college savings program, you might consider cashing them in at some point and reinvesting the money in new ones that are eligible for the tuition tax break. Savings bonds can be bought, without commissions or fees of any kind, from banks, savings institutions, or through payroll savings plans offered by many employers. A bank that does not carry an inventory of bonds in the larger denominations may provide you with the form necessary to order the bonds from your nearest <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> or branch. The government promises to replace your bonds without a fuss if they are stolen, lost or destroyed. To be on the safe side, advisers say, make a list of the bonds you own, their face amounts, serial numbers and purchase dates, and keep the list somewhere separate from where the bonds are stored. That way, you'll be able to be very specific should you ever have to ask to have them replaced.

<HEAD>Steven Banks Brings Innovative One-Man Show to Showtime</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> is not easy to categorize. He's a comedian, actor, rock musician and impressionist. He's very funny _ and he has something to say. His one-man tour-de-force, `` <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>' Home Entertainment Center,'' has been packing them in on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and viewers of the Showtime cable network get a look-see beginning Saturday. The hour-long show was taped on stage at Marines Memorial Theatre in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. This month, Banks begins an extended run at the <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Set in Banks' slovenly bachelor pad, the show is a series of imaginative comic vignettes, but in a larger sense it's an inspiring story about being stuck in life at thirtysomething and taking a risk to get your dream. It opens with Banks coming home early from his dead-end job in the corporate maze and donning his jammies so he can delve into his fantasy life as a rock star. He cheers his own entrance with the chant: `` Banks! Banks! Banks! Banks! ...'' His telephone messages include repeated and increasingly irritated calls from the office, but also a surprise call from <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, a high-school pal who's now a rock star. The eccentric Banks' kitchen shelves are lined with boxes of <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> cookie mix, the sink is full of dirty dishes, and the walls plastered with posters of his musical heroes. The slightest task, be it talking on the phone or typing, turns into a performance. Banks is being hounded by his boss, Mr. <PERSON> Buttle </PERSON>, to finish writing a speech that was due that afternoon. Though his intentions are good, Banks constantly distracts himself by any means available to avoid the mundane, and grown-up, job. At one point, he emerges from his closet in a tacky Vegas jumpsuit, stuffs it with a pillow and launches into a homage to <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>, `` Who Killed the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION>' n' Roll?'' Banks' childlike imaginings turn bitingly satiric. `` It was n't me, says <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>,'' goes one verse. `` I loved my dad and he loved me. ... When I get all of his mon-ey, I'll give it to Scientology. ...'' Banks is also being pressured by his girlfriend, <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON>, who intends to move in with him. Not only that, the landlord is complaining about the noise from his drums and promises to toss Banks out if there is one more drumbeat from his apartment. So Banks grabs up a guitar and gets so involved in his impersonation of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, he answers the phone in a nasal, `` There's no one here by that name. This is the <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> residence. ... D-Y-L-A-N. ... <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> ... B-O-B. ... Yes, it is. ... Why, thank you very much!'' When <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> calls back, <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> thinks he's being offered the chance of a lifetime _ Lance's drummer has quit. But Banks' drum audition over the phone only succeeds in costing him his apartment _ he's already lost his girlfriend and is on the verge of losing his job So he does the only reasonable thing _ explodes into a punk-rock ode to his own life: `` Twenty-two: degree! Twenty-three: McDonald's! Twenty-four: Unemployment! Twenty-five: <PERSON> Buttle </PERSON>! Twenty-six: <PERSON> Buttle </PERSON>! Twenty-seven, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32! But now I'm 33, I'm tryin' to be cool, I'm jumping around in my living room ...'' The song fades as Banks realizes that's exactly what he's doing and his life is a shambles But this is a show with a happy ending, even in real life. The theater audience gives Banks a standing ovation and provides an authentic, `` Banks! Banks! Banks!''

<HEAD>Taxing Inflation, A Legislated Snow Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the capital gains tax law now reads, you could pay taxes on no gains at all, which is just one of the reasons why the capital gains issue could become a hot topic of discussion in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this year. The discussion would n't be a new one; it has been around for two decades, and if action is n't taken this year it will be around next year too. In fact, the debate is likely to continue as long as inflation exists. The explanation for this oddity is that the capital gains tax law imposes a levy on inflation. It causes people to pay taxes on imagined `` income,'' on earnings that never were. In some instances, it might even tax losses. Tempers are flaring. Supporters of the existing capital gains law argue that to lower the rate would be a gift to the rich, while advocates of change contend that the existing law is a legislated snow job. For this and other reasons, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seeks to fulfill a campaign promise to lower the maximum capital gains tax rate, which is now at the same 28 percent to 33 percent that applies to ordinary income. And it may be a factor also in causing Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to consider relaxing his strong opposition to a cut. The existing law makes no provision whatever for inflation, although inflation has long been a fact of modern life and most likely will continue to be. In fact, only rarely since World War II has it been absent. Consider the predicament of an investor who bought $ 10,000 of mutual funds in 1983 and who today still has only $ 10,000 in purchasing power after selling his shares. The fund did appear to grow _ by 21 percent _ but so did inflation. For taxing purposes, the taxpayer has earned $ 2,100, to be assessed at whatever his or her tax rate might be. But in reality _ in terms of dollars equal in purchasing power _ the investor has never made a nickel of profit because the gains did not outpace inflation during that period. It could have been worse. The value of the investor's shares could have dropped to $ 9,000 in real dollar terms but, because of inflation, have given the appearance of having risen to more than $ 10,000. Already a loser by $ 1,000 in real dollars, the investor becomes a double loser after paying taxes. It is a situation that hardly encourages long-term or risky investments in the American economy by either rich or poor. What might be a fair solution, indexation, has always been available to lawmakers but for mysterious reasons it never has been used. Lawmakers, like most people, may not like to concede that inflation is a long-term boarder. Indexation would automatically erase from tax computations any `` gains'' attributable solely to inflation, leaving taxes to be assessed only on real earnings as measured by dollars of comparable purchasing power. Simply stated, tax assessors would use the same measuring stick of value for the investment when made and for the investment when redeemed for dollars. As matters stand, critics say, the calibrations on the measuring stick vary from year to year. For example, whereas a linear foot in 1983 had 12 inches, in 1989 it is declared, in effect, to have no more than 9.5 inches. Why, they say, you would n't even consider measuring snow that way.

<HEAD>Homosexual Congregation Breaks Ground By Joining Mainline Christian
Church</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Though churches have condemned homosexual activity for centuries, gay men and women are beginning to find a home within a mainline Christian denomination. The Spirit of the <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> became the nation's first openly homosexual congregation to join a mainline church when it was accepted into membership of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> in April, according to its leader. `` As far as we know, we're making history,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON>, pastor of Spirit of the Lakes. `` We see ourselves as a prophetic voice. `` We hope that we're breaking ground and leading the way for other churches and other denominations to open up and recognize gay and lesbian people's rightful place in the church.'' Spirit of the Lakes has grown from 18 people meeting in a living room in May 1987 to 150 members. It was voted into membership by more than 80 percent of the delegates attending the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>'s three associations in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> with 71 churches and 24,000 members. Spirit of the Lakes is considered a `` developing'' church while the association reviews the group's constitution and development plan. Those are likely to be approved at the association's 1990 annual meeting, formalizing the congregation's admission, association officials say. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loliger </PERSON>, co-coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian-Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerns </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, Ohio-based special-interest group within the church, said the acceptance of Spirit of the Lakes is a first for mainline denominations. `` This one is certainly very different than anything we have encountered before,'' he said. `` It is an openly gay and lesbian congregation, and they have sought to become a church with that right up front.'' Most Christian churches accept homosexuals as members, equally beloved by <PERSON> God </PERSON> as others, but condemn the practice of homosexuality. But the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, a 1.8-million-member Protestant church formed in 1957 when the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> merged with the <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, often has been at the forefront of progressive social movements. In 1969, the church's general synod approved its first resolution supporting civil rights for homosexuals, and three years later it became the first mainline denomination to ordain an openly gay minister. In 1983, the general synod passed a resolution stating that `` a person's sexual orientation is not a moral issue'' and that sexual orientation should not be the basis for discrimination within the church. The synod encouraged <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> churches to openly accept homosexuals as members. That inclusiveness is what attracted Spirit of the Lakes to the denomination. <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON>, 39, who grew up in <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb, received a master of divinity degree from the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> school in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He took over as pastor of Spirit of the Lakes in September and immediately began pursuing membership in the denomination. `` The discussion was, ` Why bother to affiliate at all?' Most -LRB- homosexuals -RRB- look at established churches as oppressive institutions,'' <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> said. But the membership was attracted by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>'s structure, which allows autonomy for each congregation `` This is the best of both worlds for us,'' he said. `` We can remain an autonomous congregation ... and still associate with a larger Christian body. That allows us to be a community of gay-lesbian Christians and at the same time not be ghetto-ized.'' He described the congregation as college-educated professionals who come from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Lutheran and Episcopal backgrounds and are interested in social justice, peace, liberation and feminist theology. Although Spirit of the Lakes has generally met with quiet acceptance, some have voiced reservations. `` I do not think that any congregation should come in with a sexual or a racial orientation,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>, senior minister of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayzata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would be bothered if somebody proposed a church just for men, or a church just for women, or a church just for married couples, and so on.'' <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> says 10 percent of his church's membership is heterosexual. Spirit of the Lakes also is bucking Christian tradition which holds that the practice of homosexuality is a sin. People who interpret the Bible literally point to several Old and New Testament passages that appear to condemn homosexuality. One is <LOCATION> Leviticus </LOCATION> 20:13, which according to the Revised Standard Version says, `` If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination.'' But <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON> contend that the Bible must be interpreted in the context of the time in which it was written. When <PERSON> Leviticus </PERSON> was written, <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> said, `` the Israelites were instinctively concerned with maximizing the probabilities of procreation. Religious laws governing sexual practices reinforced that basic tribal concern.'' <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> criticizes people who use specific Bible verses to condemn homosexuals today. `` It's not taking the Bible as a whole,'' he said. `` It's picking out little bits and pieces to justify cultural prejudices.''

<HEAD>Opera Bastille: High Tech Musical Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The countdown has begun at the Opera Bastille. Some 1,500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open July 13 as the French mark the bicentennial of their revolution. French opera buffs hope the high-tech musical complex _ built on the square where revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789 _ will finally put <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on the international music map. For the moment, doubts remain. The new Opera had been leaderless since last January when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> conductor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> was fired because of what President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s representative said were his high fees and `` elitist views'' on opera. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Yves </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurent </ORGANIZATION> fashion empire and the man <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> appointed to manage the project in its final days, said <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>'s replacement would be someone who understood the president's wish to create a `` modern and popular opera'' accessible to the masses. Five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when that someone turned out to be <PERSON> Myung-Whung </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, a 36-year-old Korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist. Soft-spoken and unemotional, the new music director said he would be a team player eager to work `` in harmony and unison'' with Opera Bastille administrators. Warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting that has beset the project from the start, he said, `` If there is a fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I wo n't fight. I'll just leave.'' Although <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> declined to divulge <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s salary, he said his five-year contract requires the maestro be in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for 27 weeks a year for a minimum of 30 performances, <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> also let it be known he has his own ideas on `` popular opera.'' `` Popular means the house is full and people are dying to get in,'' he said in an interview. `` I'd like to broaden the opera-going public and see more young people and students in the audience.'' Meanwhile, workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural concert, billed originally as the centerpiece of official bicentennial celebrations to be performed before <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other luminaries. French conductor <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Pretre </PERSON> will conduct the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera Ballet Orchestra and Chorus, with a host of international celebrities performing selected arias from well-known French operas. The concert will be staged by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the longtime darling of the French avant-garde. The Opera-Bastille's first bona fide operatic production is scheduled for next February. Although <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> did not reveal the program, the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself. The new Opera is a hulking mass of polished granite, glass and stainless steel designed by Canadian architect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>. Critics compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock, looming over the <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bastille </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The prison was torn down during the revolution. A technical wonder, the Opera Bastille is everything the ornate, century-old <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera is not. The Palais <PERSON> Garnier </PERSON> may be a landmark known worldwide for its baroque design and Chagall-decorated ceiling, but it has been inadequate for decades. The old Opera has a scant 1,600 seats with unobstructed views and virtually no backstage, which meant that sets had to be built elsewhere, dismantled, brought in and reconstructed. The cost was staggering, and so were ticket prices. Tickets to the new Opera Bastille are expected to cost a maximun of 250 francs -LRB- about $ 40 -RRB-, less than half their cost at the Palais <PERSON> Garnier </PERSON>, which from now on will be devoted to ballet. The Opera Bastille has 12 stages in all, including a main stage flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to the main stage, plus five identical stages one level below. All are fitted with freight elevators, electronically controlled and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10 minutes. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON>, the scenic director who drew up the technical specifications, calls the Opera Bastille `` practical, not sophisticated.'' `` Sophisticated means complicated, and this building is n't complicated,'' he said during a tour of the building `` It's very simple. It's a place where you have a lot of space. Here we do n't have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between performances. The main stage offers 4,300 square feet of space and is 66 feet high. It is equipped with 9 elevators, 72 traps and a movable orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes. A bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load the ceiling with carpets, curtains and other decor without monopolizing the stage. The ceiling is also designed for storage, thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate. There is ample space for costumes, workshops and storage areas, connected directly to the main stage. The Opera Bastille is a musician's dream with rehearsal rooms galore _ three for the orchestra, two for ballet, two for the chorus, 16 studios for singers and 12 for musicians. While backstage areas are still dusty construction sites, the main hall itself is nearly ready. On a recent visit, workmen were busy polishing granite pillars, washing windows, waxing hardwood floors and installing cushions. Despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white, black and gray, the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate, aided, in part, to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of Japanese pagodas. <PERSON> Dittmann </PERSON> says the hall's computer-analyzed acoustics are excellent. Even the hall's chairs have been designed with acoustics in mind: There are small holes which allow the sound to pass through when they are empty. A polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from the three metro lines that intersect under the Place de la Bastille. `` If that is n't enough, the subway cars themselves will be fitted with special rubber tires,'' he said.

<HEAD>Analyst Says Lack of Innovation Partly to Blame for Soviet Food Lag</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The huge purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are welcomed by American farmers and are seen by some analysts as proof that the vast agricultural system dictated by Kremlin policy is inefficient. Whether the Soviet agricultural shortcomings are a result of poor technology, planning, climate or other factors are tantalizing subjects for debate. But some of the facts _ notably <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s huge food imports _ are unmistakeable. In the year that began last Oct. 1, the Soviets have bought a record of more than 20 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn, mostly the latter. Not to mention soybeans, soybean meal and sorghum grain. In all, says <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> export analyst <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmers will ship a record $ 3.4 billion worth of commodities to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year, up from $ 1.93 billion in 1987-88. Soviet agriculture clearly has been unable to keep up with rising domestic demand. Some observers have cited the central planning of agricultural policy as a principal reason for Soviet deficiencies; others say farmers are not given enough incentives; and still others say the Soviets are technologically inferior in food production. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> notes that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a speech early this year, called for broad reforms of his nation's agriculture. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had said that agricultural investment in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s bread basket, increased by 320 percent over the past 20 years, while production rose by only 39 percent. <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON>, writing in the June issue of <LOCATION> Farmline </LOCATION> magazine, examined the `` technical efficiency'' of Soviet agriculture, roughly a measure of `` output per amount of inputs,'' or the resources used to produce crops and livestock. Many western researchers have assumed that Soviet agriculture is not technically efficient. <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> said he is not so certain. `` The Soviets combine resources differently than we do,'' he said. `` For instance, they use relatively more labor and less machinery than we do. But considering the way they use their resources, they appear to be just as technically efficient as we are. They seem able to use an older, more labor-intensive technology efficiently.'' Production costs are higher in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but given the available resources, <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> said Soviet farmers produce close to the maximum level possible. Using a computer model to compare agricultural production, <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> found that given different combinations of the same resources _ fertilizer, labor, livestock, machinery and land _ regions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> compared favorably with those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. The results do n't mean that agricultural production in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is as cost-effective as in the other countries, <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> said. It's not, he said, but Soviet agriculture `` generally achieves as great an output as possible _ as great as the non-Soviet areas were able to achieve _ given the resources available to work with.'' Thus, <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> said, the ills of Soviet agriculture, including the heavy handedness by planners and the lack of incentives for farmers `` appear to have little impact on technical efficiency'' when compared with the regions studied. Why, then, is there such stagnation in Soviet agriculture? <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> lacks `` dynamic efficiency,'' or the ability to expand or grow where it counts. `` The Soviet and non-Soviet systems -LRB- in the study -RRB- have nearly equal levels of technical efficiency, but the non-Soviet areas are more effective at growth,'' he said. `` Perhaps the reason lies in the inability of central planners to facilitate innovation and technological change.'' <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> added: _ Soviet farmers are slow at introducing new technology because they are `` in a sense hamstrung'' by the government _ When farmers need new equipment, they have to request it from central authorities, who may or may not plan to produce such equipment in the next five-year plan _ If technology everywhere is static and no major improvemnts are made, Soviet farming can be considered technologically efficient But as technical changes take place in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, for example, Soviet farmers lag behind. `` They're already using more and more resources and not achieving any greater output,'' <PERSON> Koopman </PERSON> said. `` They need to encourage more flexibility, more autonomy, more incentives to innovate _ rather than just trying to improve their allocation and use of resources.'' Just giving incentives to farm workers is n't enough by itself, he said. They must have more freedom to select what they need to produce.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ With the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> relaxing Stalin-era bans on the practice of religion, dozens of new Islamic mosques are opening across <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, a land awakening from decades of complacent cronyism.

 <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, an arid land historically at the crossroads of caravans and conquerors, is being buffeted by resurgent Islam from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and political reforms from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. With new freedoms under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, residents of the broad band separating the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Slavic heartland from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are expressing their religious, ethnic, and political concerns. That represents further progress for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose program already has stirred other areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But it also sets the stage for a possible race between secular communist reform and revitalized Islam for the future of a land awakening from decades of complacent cronyism. Much depends on the abilities of new civil and religious leaders to persuade people that more freedom can help solve their problems and not just offer a vent for their frustration. Such frustration has sparked bloodshed in other southern Soviet republics _ <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ and appears to be spreading to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Severe economic problems led to rioting in two cities of the Turkmen republic bordering <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in May. A rampage of arson and murder between ethnic groups in eastern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> in the past week killed scores of people. But ultimate success in the region is vital to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, faced across its southern frontier with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic fundamentalism and Afghan rebels who fought the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to a standstill. Both inspire some radicals. In an interview after being chosen the new spiritual leader of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s Moslems recently, 36-year-old <PERSON> Mohammadsadyk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamayusupov </PERSON> indicated he would follow previous religious leaders in cooperating with the government, but use the reforms broadly to improve religious life. `` We intend to use this moment very judiciously for the development of our religion and the renewal of its spiritual life,'' he says. <PERSON> Mamayusupov </PERSON> has moved quickly where he can. Between Feb. 6 and mid-March authorities gave permission for the opening of about 35 new mosques, and he pledged that `` we will continue to open mosques until all the requests of our Moslems are satisfied.'' Only about 200 mosques are sprinkled across the five Central Asian republics: <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kirghizia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>, which occupy an area half the size of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The number of students in Islamic academies is being doubled and the number of Korans and other religious books being published will be greatly increased. The Kremlin is removing a Stalin-era ban on group religious education and plans to allow believers to organize charities. But radicals predict the increased attention to religious needs will lead more people to embrace Islamic fundamentalism. `` We need to raise the people up,'' said one Moslem radical who favors establishment of an Iranian-style Islamic republic. `` It wo n't be in two, three, or four years. It has to be done very quietly.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. The stakes are considerable. The population of the five Central Asian republics is booming. From 1970 to 1987, it increased 26 percent to 47.5 million and now makes up about 18 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> population. At the center of much of the region's activity is <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and its capital, <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>. The historic cities of <LOCATION> Bukhara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samarkand </LOCATION> along the Silk Route are centers of religious culture. What is now <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> accepted Islam in the first century after <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> and was a crossroads for <ORGANIZATION> Mongols </ORGANIZATION>, Turks, Persians and Slavs until it was absorbed in <LOCATION> Czarist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s drive south in the 19th century. Although officially atheist, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> nevertheless has maintained relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> held a rare meeting with <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> last winter. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has supported Arab causes in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomatically and militarily for more than two decades, but now is trying to improve relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in order to play a bigger role in any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement. <PERSON> Mamayusupov </PERSON>, rector of the <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, owes his selection in part to the resurgence of religious feelings. In early February, <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamsuddinkhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Babakhan </PERSON> was ousted by a series of protests in which radicals accused him of corruption and lacking sufficient religious knowledge. A council of religious leaders elected Mamayusupov to replace him.

 Six weeks after ousting <PERSON> Babakhan </PERSON>, believers were demonstrating again. But this time they were praising God for the return of a 7th-century Koran, a gift from the <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> government. There also have been protests that have taken on a more political or ethnic character, reflecting other influences. Ethnic resentment between <LOCATION> Uzbekis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, who were forcibly resettled to eastern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1944, exploded in early June. Scores of people died and hundreds of houses were torched. Thousands of <LOCATION> Meskhis </LOCATION> were evacuated to protect them, but even then the 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers sent in had difficulty keeping order. Bands of young people frustrated with high prices and consumer shortages rioted in two cities of the Turkmen republic bordering <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at the beginning of May. On April 9, <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> sources said, several thousand people rallied to support <PERSON> Belik </PERSON>, an informal political group seeking to establish Uzbek as the republic's official language and calling for drastic measures to improve the environment. <PERSON> Belik </PERSON> means `` unity'' in the Uzbek language. In <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, as in the Baltic republics and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the deteriorating environment has become a rallying point that has opened up broader issues such as economic reform and demands for more local control. <PERSON> Gafkha </PERSON> <PERSON> Namatova </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Belik </PERSON> spokeswoman, said the group claims 100,000 members. It supports <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, she said, but `` we see a lot that we like'' in the programs of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> grassroots organizations that have sprung up in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere. National policies demanding cotton production in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> have led to food shortages, she said. Abuse of farm chemicals on those same cotton fields has increased infant mortality, she charged. In an interview with the Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> in March, the republic's new president, <PERSON> Mirzaolim </PERSON> <PERSON> Izragimov </PERSON>, said cotton-growing must be de-emphasized. The policy of pushing marginal land into production ruined 1.73 million acres of pasture, he said. Drainage of rivers that flow into the <LOCATION> Aral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, on the border of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, has lowered the level of the sea and made it one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s top environmental concerns. Many of the policies and practices now being repudiated in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are associated with former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and his supporters. But experience has shown the danger of replacing local officials, ignoring ethnic feelings. In 1986, riots broke out in <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, following the replacement of the republic's party leader <PERSON> Dinmukhamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunaev </PERSON> by <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kunaev </PERSON>, an ethnic Kazakh, was a Politburo member and a close associate of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kolbin </PERSON> is a Russian. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, was sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp last December after being convicted of accepting more than $ 145,000 from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Mamayusupov </PERSON> pledged religious leaders would become more socially active, fighting bribery, alcoholism and prostitution. Attacks on those social ills are not likely to bring him into conflict with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, but Moslem leaders could run into difficulty with local authorities if they launch a serious anti-corruption campaign. `` Moslems intend to struggle very actively in the social sphere,'' he said, adding that ecology is the first target. While some civil discontent is organized openly through <PERSON> Belik </PERSON> and similar organizations, the religious discontent remains largely hidden. An underground group calling itself Islam and Democracy claimed credit for the protests that ousted <PERSON> Babakhan </PERSON>, but it since has splintered. <PERSON> Almaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estekov </PERSON>, the 33-year-old chairman, preaches the need for a strengthening of Islam as well as establishment of Western-style civil liberties. But he said Islam and Democracy ultimately can not cooperate with <PERSON> Belik </PERSON> because of the latter's secular views. The influence of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may be limited. The vast majority of Soviet Moslems are Sunnis, while Shiites are dominant in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The two sects have deep historic differences. <PERSON> Mamayusupov </PERSON> said the traditions of Soviet Moslems are strong enough that they will not be carried away by attempts to export a radical Islamic movement from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We have our own view and our own foundation,'' he says. `` We can influence others, but others can not influence us.''

 On the stage of the <ORGANIZATION> Eighth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Piano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION>, 12 pianists try to survive the last performances of the semifinals. They sweat and smile nervously between pieces, as tension fills the auditorium at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where a winner will be announced on Sunday, June 11. But the question whispered seat-to-seat is, `` Where is <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>?'' The 54-year-old pianist and namesake of the quadrennial piano competition has taken on the aura of mystery man in the world of classical music since, at the age of 23, he stunned the world by winning the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. His retirement from public performances in 1977, and his plans to return to the concert stage later this month, have only increased curiosity about the pianist, who says he does n't want the world of music to take him too far from the other things he holds dear. `` I want to have a balance, so that I can see my friends _ the public _ and also be able to have home life,'' he said in an interview. `` I must say, I'm such a Texan, being able to have blackeyed peas and corn bread and turnip greens is just terribly wonderful.'' It was 1958, the height of the Cold War, when his <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> victory in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> catapulted <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> to international celebrity status. He was the first American ever to win the coveted prize, and he won by playing the explosive and romantic Piano Concerto No. 1. His reception back home in the states was akin that to that granted Olympians: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> gave him a ticker tape parade, the city's first for a musician, and his concert schedule ballooned to 100 dates a season. Today, <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> is incredulous when he looks back on that time. `` Somebody would say, ` How many did you play?' and I'd say, ` Oh, sometimes I ... do n't want to count.''' In 1977, <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> said `` enough'' and stopped accepting concert dates. While many thought his rest would be short, his hiatus stretched to 10 years when he performed at the White House for Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife. He plans to return to the concert stage June 19 in a benefit performance of the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1 and the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>. Some of his recordings have been rereleased on compact disc and new recordings are planned. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>, however, does n't plan to allow the second stage of his career grow as hectic as the first. `` I love people and I love to meet them and all that, but I love home life, and being able to be at home. That has been such a joy for me,'' he said. Home, since 1987, has been a house overlooking <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> where he lives with his mother and first piano teacher, 92-year-old <PERSON> Rildia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, but spent his boyhood in the east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kilgore </LOCATION>. He began playing piano when he was 3 years old, and made his orchestral debut with the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> when he was 12. The following year, he performed at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, made his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Philharmonic debut at 19 and went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at 23. But <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> never retired from the social scene, frequenting favorite operas, restaurants and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> social events even while his career was on hold. And the social whirl is never more frenzied than during the competition, founded in 1962 to bring an international piano contest to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and honor <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>. This year it began May 27 with 38 competitors. The event has a budget of more than $ 2.5 million and draws competitors from around the world. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> sees its jury process, which winnows a field of 38 competitors down to six finalists, then a winner, as `` a way of divining an opportunity cycle'' for young artists. The competitors' careers, he believes, will hinge on their ability to communicate music, what he calls `` great pages of literature,'' to the audience and, during the competition, to the jurors. `` This is a performer's competition, and a performer is a servant; he serves the composer and he serves the audience,'' <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> said. `` In my own case, I'm a very good audience _ I always say that I am _ because I go to hear someone because I enjoy being a member of an audience and I get very excited if someone speaks to me.'' <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> makes no choices in his own mind as he listens to the performers, instead envisioning each in his or her career. A crowd favorite entering the final round is 19-year-old <PERSON> Aleksei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultanov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the youngest competitor this year, whose appeal appears to rest in his individualistic style and boyish charm. During the semifinals, <PERSON> Sultanov </PERSON> brought more than half the audience to its feet with a rousing finale of <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>'s Sonata No. 3 in B minor. Audience members were again standing after the final recital of the semifinals by <PERSON> Benedetto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, who concluded with <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON>'s Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor. <PERSON> Lupo </PERSON>, 25, also reached the finals. Other finalists are <PERSON> Elisso </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkvadze </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtarkman </PERSON>, 22, both of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocarelli </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Tian </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shtarkman </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Naum </PERSON>, took third place to <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>'s first in the 1958 <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> said that while he does n't plan to repeat the whirlwind of performances that followed that <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>, some aspects of a concert career never change. One case in point: music critics. `` I've lived through all of that before, so I mean, that will be not new,'' he said. Nevertheless, he is fearful as he plans his return to a concert schedule. It's the same emotion he recalls experiencing every time he went on stage. `` One of the things that you always feel as a performer _ at least I always felt _ I always wanted so to do my best. If I did n't do my best, I would be the person that would be hurt the most and disappointed the most,'' he said `` So every time I go on stage, you just remember _ I'll be certainly wanting to do my best.''

 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, owner of a small electronics business in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, always dreamed of a vacation hideaway, where he and his family could play tennis or stroll on the beach any time they wanted. But the 45-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> man could n't afford to do more than look until the developers of a nearby <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> condominum slashed the price of their units by at least 40 percent. He and wife <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> recently snapped up a `` buy of a lifetime'' two-bedroom, oceanfront condo for $ 113,000, and received easy financing. `` The only thing I regret is that I did n't buy a three-bedroom condo instead,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. A number of equally anxious vacationers wo n't just be sunbathing at the beach, fishing the lakes and hiking the woods this summer. They're also likely to do some serious sightseeing in the local housing market. Despite an overall slump in the property business nationwide, real estate experts say this season is turning out to be a hot one for many buyers. Many parts of the country offer bargain prices due to the fallout from recent tax-reform changes, overbuilding, regional economic downturns and declining interest rates, experts say. `` If I was in the market for a second home ... I would consider now a good time to buy,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, a senior vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Residential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based trade group. `` There are a lot of good values out there.'' Although bargains can be had in just about any state if you look hard enough, the market for the nation's 5.5 million vacation homes varies by region just as with vacation spots. Some of the standouts this year, <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> and other experts say, include properties located in parts of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>; the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gulf coast; <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Condominiums, in particular, carry big price cuts, experts say. Units in the low - to medium-price range, which were eagerly snapped up by investors during the inflationary 1970s and early 1980s, are being unloaded because the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated most of the tax incentives on second homes, particularly for those who rent out their properties `` There's more demand this year for detached homes, little less demand in condos. That's where I think one can do quite well,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON>, an agent with ERA Byse Realtors, a <LOCATION> Laconia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, broker that sells vacation homes in resort areas like <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Winnipesaukee </LOCATION>. He said vacation homes prices, in general, have flattened out in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> this year after skyrocketing two years ago. Prices range from around $ 75,000 to $ 500,000. Condo prices on <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, have declined by about 40 percent overall from the mid-1980s, although oceanfront property has n't been hurt as much, according to local broker <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Toon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. For as little as $ 25,000, bargain hunters can pick up a modest two-bedroom modular unit on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, about a quarter of what they sold for five years ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON> said More upscale oceanfront condos usually start at around $ 120,000, she said. Further south, in the northern portion of <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON> electrician, bought his vacation home, waterfront units that sold for $ 200,000 three years ago now go for around $ 120,000, said one developer, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nisbet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ponton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's probably below cost,'' <PERSON> Ponton </PERSON> said, but added that prices are starting to rebound a bit from last year as the oil-driven <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy improves. Out West, older homes and condos in the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> also have been especially hit hard, experts say. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> accountant <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said the three-bedroom house he bought in the popular ski resort area of <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, would probably fetch the same price he bought it at seven years ago _ around $ 120,000. But <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> is taking the market downturn in stride. He said he bought his vacation home as an easy getaway to enjoy and relax, rather than as an alternative to the financial markets. Experts agree that prospective buyers should consider more than just price when looking for a second home. What good is owning an inexpensive cabin across the country, for instance, if it costs a fortune to get there? `` Most middle-income buyers should look at some place that can be reached within a day's drive,'' said <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>. `` You should n't buy something that does n't have demand. `` It's kind of like anything in life: A bargain is not a bargain unless it's something you want,'' said <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said buyers should do some careful research before reaching any decision, like tracking local economic trends or making sure the area in which they plan to buy is n't being overbuilt. It's also important to get a handle on local property taxes. `` You want to make sure it is a vacation home,'' said Diamond. `` Some people are shocked when they thought they bought a vacation home ... and found themselves faced with the high cost of providing schools and infrastructure in the far out suburbs.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aramco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s oil-producing firm, says it struck a large well that could yield 8,000 barrels a day of crude oil The company, which operates the world's largest oil field in a country with the world's largest reserves, said Wednesday the find was made in the <LOCATION> Hawtah </LOCATION> region in central <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> about 120 miles south of the capital <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. Saudi Aramco said preliminary tests indicated the well could yield 8,000 barrels a day of light crude containing only 0.06 percent sulphur. Sadad, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for exploration and production, said the find `` confirms the potential for substantial discoveries ... in rock formations recently studied by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aramco </LOCATION> and assessed to be highly prospective.'' Oil industry executives and company sources reported the strike Tuesday. But they said it was made in the nearby <LOCATION> Khurais </LOCATION> region and gave no details. The find was made as part of a major exploration program launched by <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 after the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government expanded the company's exploration concession. It was the first strike since <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION> was restructured in late 1988 and the first in a promising area only recently identifed. Most of the company's oil field is located in the east part of the country. Saudi Aramco announced earlier this year that its proven reserves have gone up from 169 billion to 252 billion barrels, and could reach 315 billion barrels. The company has discovered 52 oil fields and one commercial gas field since it started exploration 55 years ago. Under its current Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries quota, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> exports 4.524 million barrels a day, but in the oil boom years output peaked at more than 11 million barrels a day.

<HEAD>New Season Production Outlook Better Than Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New season world grain production may be larger than forecast, with early signs of an 11.4 percent increase on the current season's drought-hit yield, according to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The council, one of the foremost grain forecasting bodies, now puts world wheat output between July 1989 to June 1990 at 533 million metric tons, compared with 537 million forecast last month and 504 million last season. Production of coarse grains _ principally maize, rye, oats, barley and sorghum, is now forecast at 840 million tons, against 830 million previously and 728 million this season, the council said Wednesday. The rise is attributed to improved prospects for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with forecasts of 112 million tons for the Soviets, up from with 97.6 million in 1988-89, and 240 million for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, compared with 149.6 million. Bigger coarse grain crops are also foreseen for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at 95 million against 93.6 million this season and the European Community at 90 million, compared with 89.3 million. The Indian harvest, however, is expected to fall 2.6 million tons to 30 million. Forecasts of 1989-90 wheat production, with 1988-89 estimates in brackets, include: <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 90.0 million -LRB- 84.5 million -RRB-; <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 89 million -LRB- 87 million -RRB-; the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> 86.7 million -LRB- 85.3 million -RRB-; the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 56.5 million -LRB- 49.3 million -RRB-; and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> 50 million -LRB- 45.1 million -RRB-. The council's first forecast of 1989-90 world coarse grain trade is down eight million tons at 93 million, reflecting the prospect of lower Soviet imports, which could drop by 9 million to 16 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders are faced with two deals involving their publishing and cable company _ a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a tender offer from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Here is a capsule description on what is being proposed:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>THE WARNER DEAL:</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> have agreed on a merger that involves an exchange of stock to create a company that would be the world's largest media and entertainment concern. Under that plan, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would get one share in the new company for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stock they own. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would get 0.465 shares of stock in the new company for each <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> share they hold. The arrangement would leave <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders with roughly 40 percent of the new company and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders with the rest.

 Media and entertainment companies were in the spotlight on Wall Street as news of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 10.7 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> revived speculation about possible bids for other communications concerns The stocks of several big media firms rose sharply Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.87 -LCB- to close at $ 56.62 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> surged $ 4.75 to $ 205.62 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> picked up $ 7.50 to $ 468; and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose planned merger with Time was cast into doubt by the Paramount bid, rose $ 1.75 to $ 53.50. Wednesday's advances were similar to gains chalked up earlier this year when Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to merge and form the world's largest media concern. News of a big takeover bid for a company often sparks interest in other firms in that industry, but the activity in media and entertainment stocks has had an added twist recently. The media, information and entertainment industries have undergone a wave of consolidations in recent years, with large companies snapping up other firms to create media giants. The buyers mainly have been foreign publishing and broadcasting giants such as <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and electronics behemoth <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. These companies have scooped up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media concerns in a torrent of deals made possible in recent years by their own wealth and the weak <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. The growth of media conglomerates was uppermost in the minds of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> executives as they negotiated their agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, apparently wants to be part of the trend. If he succeeds in acquiring Time, his own entertainment and publishing conglomerate would have a projected $ 7 billion in sales. A <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> combination would have projected revenue of more than $ 10 billion. Paramount, which changed its name from <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, owns <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster and Prentice Hall publishers, and a number of other broadcasting, entertainment and publishing businesses. Time publishes magazines _ including Time, <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> and Sports Illustrated _ and books and also owns broadcast and cable television properties including Home Box Office.

<HEAD>Court Denies Eastern's Appeal on Pilots' Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says a federal appeals court ruling means <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' attempt to expand its limited service may be stalled. But <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> declined to comment on how the ruling Wednesday by the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> would affect plans for Eastern's reorganization. A three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld a lower court ruling denying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an injunction against the pilots union to stop the strike. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said the Miami-based airline has no plans to appeal the case further. In another setback for Eastern, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it plans to file an antitrust suit blocking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed sale to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of its airport gates in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Philadelphia-Toronto </LOCATION> route The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the $ 85 million proposal `` threatens to lessen competition'' in airline service between <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and other cities, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boudin </PERSON>, acting antitrust chief for the department. The appeals court ruling was prompted by a lawsuit Eastern filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after most of the airline's 3,600 pilots honored picket lines set up by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union when it went on strike March 4. The walkout, also supported by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants, virtually grounded the carrier and compelled it to seek bankruptcy protection from creditors March 9. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a communications specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling `` reaffirms the pilots' solidarity in dealing with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> He also said the ruling strengthens the union's backing of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, who is trying to buy the carrier from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said that in light of the ruling, officials for <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> will meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss the proposed buyout again. Eastern's creditors have rejected <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>'s proposal. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilian </PERSON>, a striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the ruling was not a surprise but was a morale booster. `` As time moves along, we get more and more little victories,'' he said. `` This is a good victory at a good time. It gives us that much more resolve and enthusiasm.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the ruling means <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> will not have enough pilots to carry through <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s plan to rebuild the airline as a smaller carrier and sell about $ 1.8 billion of its assets. Eastern said Wednesday it is negotiating to sell its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> routes, possibly to rival <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have talked to American,'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> also has held talks on the routes with other airlines. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> declined to identify the other carriers interested in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> network, which served 10 cities before Eastern was struck, or to disclose <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s asking price.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Warns FAA Chief on Eastern Maintenance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Shortages of staff and spare parts could be hampering strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' ability to properly maintain its fleet, the head of a congressional panel has told the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Government Activities and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> of the House Committee on Government Operations, expressed the concern in a letter to acting <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> While it is clear Eastern has suffered staffing problems because of the 3-month-old walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members, pilots and flight attendants, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' letter raised the question of whether the few planes still flying are receiving proper care. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> recently concluded a special investigation of maintenance at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s facilities at its <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> base and at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but has not disclosed its findings. The transportation subcommittee's staff has reviewed internal company documents indicating that `` manpower and parts shortages continue to plague the maintenance function of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> wrote the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> chief last Thursday. A copy of the letter was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The impact of maintenance on airline safety has been highlighted by several accidents. In one case, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> largely blamed <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' maintenance program for failing to detect fatigue damage to the fuselage of a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that split open over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, killing a flight attendant. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance shortcomings appear to persist despite several <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigations of the carrier and `` substantial'' fines against the airline, as well as commitments by management to correct the problems. <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> has n't yet responded to <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' letter, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said Wednesday. He said the special investigation was completed on May 12 but the report on it has n't yet been submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> chief `` Everything they -LRB- Eastern -RRB- do is being watched,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. `` We're going to keep a very close eye on Eastern until the strike is over.'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said he could n't comment on <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' letter because he was n't familiar with the documents to which she referred. `` Eastern is under the most intensive scrutiny that any airline's ever been subjected to,'' he said, adding that the adequacy of its manpower and parts could easily be checked Early last month, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> temporarily surrendered its repair station certificate at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> determined the carrier had failed to follow its system for recording and inspecting maintenance work. The suspension was for actions that predated the March 4 start of the strike, which pushed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy court five days later. Soon after the JFK certificate was pulled, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> sent nine inspectors to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s main base in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to determine if violations of maintenance record-keeping rules, such as those found in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, existed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. JFK, <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> are the sites of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s three principal maintenance facilities. If the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to temporarily relinquish its certificates for the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> facilities, that could severely hamper the airline's ability to operate. When a maintenance certificate is suspended, the airline is prohibited from doing work at the facility until deficiencies are corrected. The work must be contracted out, or planes needing repairs must be ferried elsewhere. In her letter, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s surrendering of its JFK certificate `` unprecedented.'' `` I am concerned that this may not be an isolated case, and may be in fact, an indication of systemic problems throughout <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance department,'' the lawmaker told <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> She asked him to advise her of the results of the latest investigation as soon as possible. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' subcommittee previously held hearings on maintenance practices at Eastern and their potential impact on passenger safety. She has expressed concern about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to continue some operations during the strike. The airline has faced a number of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigations in recent years, including one in 1986 that resulted in a $ 9.5 million fine for safety infractions and a threatened suspension of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s overall operating license Eastern's unions contend the maintenance problems are systemwide and endanger safety. They accuse supervisors of `` pencil-whipping,'' or signing their names to documents on aircraft repairs that were n't made The unions also charge that management, in an effort to cut costs and maintain flying schedules, has bullied mechanics and pilots who complain about serious maintenance violations. Eastern countercharges that some machinists hid or destroyed maintenance records at <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> and then told the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> that company supervisors neglected to have necessary work performed. Company representatives discovered records hidden in file cabinets and stuffed under sofa cushions in union areas at the airport, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. `` We've never dispatched an unsafe plane; we have one of the best safety records in the industry,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. He called union complaints `` a deliberate attempt to drive away our passengers and weaken the company.''

<HEAD>Central Bank Reveals Active Dollar-Selling Last Winter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent more than $ 2 billion to temper the dollar's rise in foreign exchange last winter, as higher interest rates and political uncertainty abroad bolstered the value of the currency, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> report shows. The latest quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> showed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 2.14 billion for the equivalent West German marks and Japanese yen during the three months ended April 30. The dollar sales, which were mostly for marks, were the largest since the $ 2.93 billion sold during the May-July 1988 period, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said. In the previous November-January quarter, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bought $ 2.4 billion against the mark and yen, then sold $ 1.88 billion against marks as market sentiment turned more bullish for the dollar. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Y </PERSON>. Cross, an executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, said the latest operations were designed to maintain market stability and generally were coordinated with the central banks of the `` Group of Seven'' industrial nations. Besides the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> includes <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Cross said that some of the government's intervention operations were done jointly with other central banks, but at other times the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acted alone after notifying its trading partners. Currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of central banks in the open markets, but the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy is to comment only well after the fact. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also does not provide any data on intervention by foreign central banks. The government's dollar-selling operations during the February-April period came amid strong foreign demand for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> short-term interest rates were comparatively higher than those abroad as a result of inflation-fighting efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. That made dollar-denominated assets more attractive to foreigners, thereby increasing the need to convert to dollars. Political developments abroad also weighed against several major foreign currencies. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an insider-trading scandal brought the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> under increasing pressure, while in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the imposition and subsequent removal of a controversial withholding tax on interest income brought considerable confusion to the market. Intervention involving marks took place from Feb. 2 to Feb. 6, when the government sold $ 350 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report. The government also entered the market between March 8 and March 30, when it sold $ 1.419 billion; on April 10 and April 11, when it sold $ 170 million; and on April 30, when it sold $ 50 million, the report said. Sales of dollars for yen were made during the March 8-30 period, amounting to $ 100 million, and on April 30, amounting to $ 50 million, it said. During the February-April period the dollar reached a high of 1.9025 marks and 133.50 yen. The dollar has risen even further lately, trading around 1.98 marks and 142 yen. The dollar reached its highest point of the decade in February 1985. It declined slightly until September 1985, when <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed to lower its value to help narrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade gap and stave off protectionist sentiment in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar touched bottom in the final days of 1987 before rebounding sharply at the beginning of 1988.

<HEAD>Consumer Borrowing Slows During April, Another Sign of Economic Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans took out $ 2.73 billion more in consumer debt than they retired in April, a sharp slowing of the borrowing pace of earlier months, the government reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that consumer credit in April rose 4.7 percent on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from 6.4 percent in March and 9.5 percent in February. April's increase was the slowest advance since a 3.5 percent gain last September and was a sharp retreat from the 8.5 percent rise in consumer debt during all of 1988. The report also reflected a sharp downward revision in the level of consumer borrowing in March, which originally was estimated to have grown at a 9.4 percent annual rate. Economist <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the report was consistent with a host of other signs that economic growth is slowing as the record peacetime expansion extends into its seventh year. `` We've been seeing for a very long time a great deal of caution in consumer borrowing, to the point that debt outstanding is begininng to fall behind the growth in personal income,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said. That Americans have kept their borrowing under control so far this year could bode well for healthy consumer spending as the year progresses, she said. Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of the economy's health because it represents two-thirds of overall economic activity. April's slowdown in borrowing occurred even though automobile loans increased at a 3.1 percent annual rate, rising by $ 752 million, after declining by 0.1 percent in March. Auto sales, which have been weak so far this year, picked up somewhat in April as carmakers launched a new round of incentives to lure shoppers back into showrooms. The economy has been slowing in recent months in response to a 15-month campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to fight inflation by pushing up interest rates and restraining economic growth. Signs emerged this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has begun to ease its grip on the money supply. April's consumer credit report revealed a sharp falloff in borrowing in the category of debt that includes credit cards. Revolving credit increased by $ 1.77 billion in April, an 11.6 percent annual rate of growth, compared with a 27.2 percent spurt in March. Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased by $ 392 million in April, a 2.4 percent annual rate of advance, down from a 9.3 percent rate of growth in March. The various changes left total consumer debt in April at a seasonally adjusted $ 693.82 billion.

<HEAD>Coniston Wins TW Services Fight With $1.65 Billion Bid</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which won <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after a bitter 9-month-long fight, said it will retain the company's core food service segments but sell off some of its other businesses <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>, which had repeatedly rejected <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s advances and tried to thwart the investor group with a variety of defenses, said Wednesday it had accepted the partnership's sweetened $ 1.65 billion offer. `` I think that in the end they realized we were determined to buy the company or at least determined to see it -LRB- the takeover battle -RRB- to the end,'' said <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal. The $ 34-per-share agreement marks the latest victory for <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, which has reaped big profits by acquiring stakes in companies, mounting or threatening to mount a takeover bid and later selling its shares back to the company or a rival bidder. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 25 cents a share to $ 33 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Wednesday. Management of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> _ whose holdings include thousands of <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants _ was reticent about the deal, which suggested their decision to accept <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s latest offer was a reluctant one. `` The only comment is that management and their directors have worked hard to bring shareholders value and feel that shareholders are getting a fair price for our stock,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> also said it planned to replace <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Salizzoni </PERSON>. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, now <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>'s president, was expected to become the new chief executive. <PERSON> Salizzoni </PERSON> was not in his office Wednesday when a reporter called for comment. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> would retain the 1,220-restaurant <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s chain; <ORGANIZATION> Spartan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest franchisee of <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s fast-food restaurants; and Canteen, which provides food services to such corporations and clients as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and Yankee However, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>'s nursing home business, and other minor divisions would be sold. Under the sweetened offer, scheduled to expire July 5, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> affiliate <ORGANIZATION> SWT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 34 in cash for 61 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>'s 48.5 million outstanding shares. That would give <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 19 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, 80 percent of the company's shares. After the offer expires, holders of the remaining 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> stock would be given the choice of receiving $ 34 in cash, or $ 30 and one share of stock in the surviving company. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> had offered $ 29 a share, or about $ 1.4 billion, for <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> had financing commitments from <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to complete the tender offer. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> first approached <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> last September. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> consistently rejected the bid as inadequate and said it would deploy its `` poison pill'' takeover defense against <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>. Poison pills drive up the cost of hostile takeovers by allowing target companies to issue additional stock. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> sought unsuccessfully to have the pill invalidated by state courts in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where TW is incorporated. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> also planned to wage a proxy fight to elect three candidates to <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>'s 11-member board, a move the company attempted to thwart by postponing its annual meeting. Despite the obstacles thrown up by <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> refused to back down. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> said its board was reviewing proposals to buy the company or its units. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the board would not reveal who the other bidders may have been or the amount of their offers. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> had earnings of $ 66.9 million in 1988 on revenue of $ 3.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> failed to win a proxy fight to force a sale of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last year, although the company later agreed to a stock buyback. In 1987, the firm helped force the restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which was renamed <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, by acquiring a large stake and threatening to mount a takeover.

<HEAD>Appears Willingness to Compromise on Capital Gains Tax Reduction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said he would consider accepting lower capital gains tax rates as a revenue-raising measure. `` I have n't seen a way'' to raise revenue in the next fiscal year without a capital gains rate cut, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today He said that with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to new taxes, `` The only thing that seems negotiable is capital gains.'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> has long opposed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to reduce the capital gains rate _ currently the same as the income tax rate on ordinary income _ to 15 percent. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a committee aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said Wednesday night that <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> had not changed his opposition to a reduction. But in an interview published today in The Wall Street Journal, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said: `` Let the process begin. ... Everything is on the table.'' <PERSON> Rostenskowski </PERSON> recognizes that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who campaigned on a slogan of `` read my lips _ no new taxes,'' and a majority of committee Republicans are going to have to accept any revenue compromise, the aide said. `` Proponents of capital gains reduction have a real leg up'' in such a situation, the aide said, because of the recognition on all sides that any change, up or down, in capital gains rates yields a revenue increase in the first year. Capital gains are the increases in value of any assets, such as stocks. A tax rate increase captures a bigger slice of the proceeds of asset sales that would be made in any case; a rate decrease stimulates more sales and brings in more government revenue that way. Economists disagree over what happens after the first year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> argues that there are permanently more transactions with lower rates than they would otherwise be; <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> and others argue that this is not so and people selling stock would get an unjustified tax break. Additionally, opponents of lower rates say that stock trading is done by people of high incomes and benefits of those rates are not available to those living on modest salaries. The <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is under instructions from the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to come up with an additional $ 5.3 billion in revenue for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> estimated that a cut in rates to 15 percent as proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would yield $ 3.5 billion in the first year though it would reduce revenue after that; the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> estimated the first-year gain at $ 4.2 billion. Though often in recent years capital gains have been taxed a separately stated rates, currently gains are treated like all other income. The top current federal income tax rate is 33 percent.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant has ceased producing electricity amid predictions from public interest groups that the shutdown called for by voters would inspire similar actions across the nation. Operators began shutting down the plant Wednesday after voters became the first in the nation to say that a working reactor should be closed. The vote was not binding on the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the problem-plagued, 15-year-old plant, but a majority of its five elected board members had promised to abide by the will of the people. The plant stopped producing electricity Wednesday morning, but the process of shutting down the reactor in the 913-megawatt plant was expected to be take up to 72 hours, said <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The utility district said mothballing or dismantling the plant will take several years and could cost more than $ 300 million. `` Basically, we will be plowing new ground,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shetler </PERSON>, Rancho Seco assistant manager. `` Total decommissioning has not been done on this level before, and we wo n't have a lot to draw on.'' Critics claimed the plant, 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, was unsafe and had a poor operating record. Tuesday's vote was 111,867 or 53.4 percent against continued operation, and 97,460 or 46.6 percent for continued operation. `` It will be essentially a shot heard around the world. Citizens are going to know they can take on city hall and win,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based coalition of environmental and public interest organizations against nuclear power. Public Citizen, a group formed in 1971 by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said in a statement that the vote `` marks the beginning of the end for nuclear power in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s love affair with the atom is over.''

 Potential brake or rear suspension problems prompted <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to recall about 119,000 of its Mercury Cougar and Ford Thunderbird cars, including the winner of a magazine's prestigious `` Car of the Year'' award. In announcing the recall Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it knew of no accidents or injuries because of the problems. Spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said all of the cars were assembled at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, between October 1988 and March 1989. Between 5 percent and 10 percent of them were Thunderbird Super Coupes. Of all those recalled, about 11,250 Thunderbirds and <ORGANIZATION> Cougars </ORGANIZATION> also will be checked for a part which, if left in place for a number of miles, could cause the rear suspension to fall apart. Motor Trend magazine gave its `` Car of the Year'' award to the Thunderbird SC in January. The car has had other problems since its formal introduction in December 1988, but Wednesday's action was the first recall involving the Super Coupe. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said that during a full turn at less than 5 mph, part of the front suspension of all the <ORGANIZATION> Cougars </ORGANIZATION> and Thunderbirds made during the five-month period could hit part of the brake mechanism. That would cause an increase in pedal travel the next time the brakes were applied, decreasing effectiveness. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the problem could be repeated during the next low-speed, full-turn brake application. Also involved in recall were about 11,250 Thunderbirds and Cougars made in mid-January. The company said 133 rear-suspension knuckles were heated improperly by a supplier, which could result in cracks and failure of the suspension. It was n't clear how many cars received knuckles from the bad batch, <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said. A suspension knuckle is an arm that attaches the wheel assembly to the frame. The company said it was unaware of any injuries or accidents because of either problem. Inspections and repairs will be performed free, the company said. The Thunderbird SC, which stands for Super Coupe, has had other problems since production began last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> withheld dealer deliveries of many of the cars late last year and early this year so it could replace a cast-iron crankshaft with a forged one. Crankshafts change the up-and-down motion of the pistons to rotary motion that goes to wheels. The crankshafts were replaced in the Super Coupe and the Cougar XR7. In February, the company said it had completed replacing an engine mounting bolt in about 10,600 of all versions of the Thunderbird and Cougar which never got to dealers.

 <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is withdrawing from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with the sale of a tire and general products subsidiary, citing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions and a devalued South African currency. The sale of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s Uitenhage, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, operations to <ORGANIZATION> Consol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> an industrial subsidiary of the South African financial, industrial and mining group <ORGANIZATION> Anglovall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, was announced Wednesday and is subject to government approvals. Consol said the purchase price was about $ 65 million. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> said the sale would result in a one-time charge of about $ 44 million after taxes, or 77 cents per share, to be recorded in the second quarter results, and after-tax proceeds from the sale are expected to total about $ 45 million. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> said most of the charge would result from the recognition of a decreased value of its assets in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> related to the devaluation of the South African currency in recent years amid racial turmoil. `` While we will regret leaving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> after providing jobs and livelihood there for 42 years, it is becoming increasingly difficult for American companies to obtain adequate returns on investments there,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>. He added that the withdrawal also was prompted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions, including a double <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax on South African earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> has described <PERSON> Anglovall </PERSON> as `` a responsible group that has demonstrated concern for human rights in the work place and has expressed intent to retain the current work force of 2,400 people,'' most of whom are non-white. <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersov </PERSON>, chairman of Anglovall, has been on the <LOCATION> Goodyear-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> board for 23 years.

 Stock prices were sharply higher at midday Thursday as several favorable factors provoked some healthy buying by British institutions. Prompted by a steady pound and a rise on Wall Street, institutions entered the market in force after remaining largely on the sidelines in previous sessions, dealers said. Share prices advanced across a broad front, with special situations and takeover speculation provoking strong rises in selected blue chip issues. At midday, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 36.1 points, or 1.7 percent, at 2,154.0, the day's best level.

 Retailing giant <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will pull out of the property and casualty insurance business by selling its Ohio-based subsidiary to <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for an undisclosed price <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> would keep its life insurance subsidiary, spokesman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said from the retailer's <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> headquarters. Unlike rival <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> had been unable to produce a satisfactory package of financial services that it could sell through its stores, <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said. `` The direction of our company is to become a department store. We found that people did not choose to make financial decisions at the same time they were shopping for apparel,'' he said. `` We tried other things to make a complete financial package, and it just did n't work for us.'' Metropolitan, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, probably would keep <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s over-the-counter insurance sales force in place for up to 18 months after the expected closing of the sale later this summer, spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON> said. Those operations eventually would be folded into Metropolitan's existing sales force of agents, direct-marketing specialists and Century 21 real estate agents, she said Less certain was the future of 770 employees at <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Westerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. Metropolitan would keep a service center there, but staffing levels had not been decided, Ms. <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON> said. `` We're going to provide all employees with opportunities to continue'' with Metropolitan, she said. Metropolitan, which writes most of its business in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, wants to expand to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> wrote nearly half its premiums in 1987 in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with other significant amounts in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> A.M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an industry rating service. <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 7 million on premiums of $ 168 million last year, about 80 percent of it in auto insurance, <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said. It had approximately 350,000 policies in force. Metropolitan Property and Casualty earned $ 40 million on premium income of $ 543 million. It had 1.1 million policies, Ms. <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON> said. Best gave <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> a B-plus rating last year, which one expert said is generally the lowest rating accepted by insurance brokers. Metropolitan improved from B-plus to A-minus.

 Bowing to complaints from viewers, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> will no longer play taps for ants and roaches in one of its insect-spray commercials. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, makers of Black Flag insecticides, said Wednesday the few notes of the military bugle call at the end of the ad will be deleted within about two weeks. `` We had some people call it to our attention, and when that happens, we look at it again,'' she said. Among those who complained was Korean War veteran Bill Temple of <LOCATION> Bryn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawr </LOCATION>. `` Taps is a symbol,'' he said. `` It represents the finality of someone's incredible sacrifice. To trivialize it by playing it after blasting a bunch of ants and roaches away is terrible.'' Ms. <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON> would n't say who had prepared the commercial or how many complaints it drew. Temple was behind a drive to build a national Korean War memorial and another to change a 1986 <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> film to reflect that the Army, not the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, fought at <LOCATION> Heartbreak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, one of the bloodiest battles in the Korean War. `` I lost an awful lot of buddies during that time I was in combat,'' he said. `` I know what taps means to the people who lost friends and relatives.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to kill a tax break for <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ownership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plans </ORGANIZATION> on grounds it has been abused by lenders. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., introduced a bill Wednesday to repeal a 1984 provision that allows banks and other lenders to escape taxes on half the income from loans made to such plans, known as ESOPs `` Once again, we have witnessed a special tax benefit provision become an abusive loophole through the ingenuity of Wall Street investment bankers,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not intend for this special tax provision to be used in such an excessive manner.'' ESOPs were given preferential treatment under federal tax law to make it easier for employees to buy stock in the companies for which they work. In many cases, ESOPs have been used to keep alive employers threatened by bankruptcy. The government estimates that 10 million workers are covered by about 10,000 ESOPs. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said there is evidence that many companies are borrowing to set up ESOPs only to obtain a tax benefit while providing nothing new for employees. He noted a week-old <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ruling that authorized public sale of bonds issued by ESOPs. That ruling, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said, will produce even more <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> borrowing. He estimated the tax preference for ESOPs will cost the treasury $ 8 billion in lost revenues over five years.

 The stock market headed higher today, extending its recent rally fueled by takeover news and rumors and declining interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.49 to 2,515.81 in the first half hour of trading. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 534 up, 389 down and 533 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 30.41 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. New takeover bids this week for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> touched off buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible future candidates for acquisitions or buyouts. <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, said to be a potential target, led the active list and rose -LCB- to 51. Time stock, meanwhile, dipped 2 to 168 and LIN slipped 1 -RCB- to 127 -RCB- after both experienced dramatic runups in Wednesday's trading. Beyond the takeover hubbub, analysts say the market has benefited from signs this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be starting a change of course in its credit policy. After more than a year of tightening credit conditions, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is widely believed to have made an initial step toward easing, by permitting a decline in the interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks edged up .11 to 182.45. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up .23 at 364.64. On Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average climbed 16.00 to 2,512.32. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 976 up, 536 down and 493 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 213.71 million shares, against 187.57 million in the previous session.

 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today began its $ 5.85 billion tender offer for the shares of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> it does not already own. The $ 120 a share offer, which will expire on July 6 unless extended, requires among other conditions approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In a news release, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> stated such approval could take six months. Shares of both companies edged lower in early trading today, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> was down $ 1.75 to $ 127.75 a share and <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> dipped 75 cents to $ 46.25 in national over-the-counter trading. On Wednesday, a day after <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> announced its bid for the New York-based cellular phone, television and publishing company, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> stock soared $ 26 a share to $ 129.50 in over-the-counter trading and <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 3.75 to $ 47 a share. But the bid had a broad spinoff effect on the stock prices of other companies involved in the cellular telephone business. Officials at rival companies said the bid created a new benchmark for the value of their cellular properties. `` We certainly see this as an important announcement,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Olberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.12 -LCB- to $ 42 and <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> rose $ 1 to $ 53.87 -LCB-. Cellular operations are a small part of those companies' revenue. By acquiring <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> would have twice the potential cellular market of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, its closest competitors. Combining both sets of franchises would form the `` regional supersystem'' of cellular holdings that <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> has been seeking, said analyst <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Cellular franchises have grown in popularity with improvements in technology and customer demand for mobile phones. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said a battle for LIN's stock was likely. `` The market is obviously anticipating a bidding war erupting,'' he said. Spokespersons for <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on whether their companies are interested in LIN, although analysts have cited both as possible suitors. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> declined to say whether the company might raise its offer. He would only say that `` the offer is on the table.'' LIN, which said it was studying the offer, has interests in cellular systems serving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, in addition to owning seven network-affiliated television stations and a specialty publishing house that produces hardcover tourist guides for hotel rooms. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, LIN's largest shareholder, has franchises serving customers in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. LIN's rights in five of the nation's top 10 markets `` would fit in very nicely'' with <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s small - to medium-sized properties, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> Details on how the deal would be structured will be announced before the end of the week, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said. Analysts estimated <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> has amassed close to $ 3 billion for the acquisition, including $ 1.5 billion through the sale of a 22 percent interest to <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 1.3 billion line of credit and $ 800 million in cash. A source close to <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> who asked not to be identified confirmed the company had put together around $ 3 billion. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s offer values LIN at about $ 6.5 billion. But since <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> already owns 9.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>, it would cost $ 5.85 billion to acquire the remaining shares. Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> announced its board had approved in principle spinning off a new subsidiary that would own its TV stations. It said it would operate its cellular operations and publishing business as a separate company. LIN said the move was made for operating and strategic reasons and was `` not intended as a precursor to any other corporate transaction.'' <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s cellular telephone systems serve 50 million `` pops,'' an industry measure that refers to market-area population multiplied by percentage ownership in the cellular systems serving those areas. LIN has more than 18 million pops, while <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> each have about 30 million. At $ 6.5 billion, <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> would be paying about $ 360 per pop. As recently as 1986, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> was buying franchises for $ 6 per pop.

<TEXT>
 A top <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday the trade bloc is ready to negotiate an `` ambitious'' 10-year trade and cooperation agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In a speech to a conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, External Relations Commissioner of the 12-nation European Economic Community <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said formal negotiations on a pact could start before August. `` It will be an ambitious agreement covering trade, commercial and economic cooperation whose scope matches the importance of the two parties,'' <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said. Copies of the speech were made available in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs ministers are to discuss on Monday proposals for a mandate to start negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Trade with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> currently accounts for 11 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s imports and 14 percent of its exports, while the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s exports to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> account for only 3 percent of its total. <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said exchanges between the two should grow in the 1990s. He indicated the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would not offer any trade concessions to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, saying that the accord would include `` most favored nation'' treatment under international trade rules established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The agreement also would offer management training, joint ventures and `` other forms of business cooperation,'' <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has signed bilateral trade agreements with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and is in advanced talks for accords with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>.

 From the Mozart-playing string quartet at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to the miniature bottles of champagne handed out in flight, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> did n't spare the glitter in launching his new Northeast shuttle airline today. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-to-Washington </ORGANIZATION> flight of the Trump Shuttle was one of the inaugural flights for the service that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> acquired from strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was n't able to meet his advertised claim for getting the flights off on time _ the scheduled 8 a.m. flight from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> took off at about 8:17 a.m., while another flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was delayed by weather and heavy traffic _ but he did live up to his reputation for hoopla. At <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>, a string quartet played <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> near a buffet crammed with mimosas and muffins. During the flight, which was packed with reporters and regular travelers, attendants dressed in new navy-and-burgundy uniforms handed out miniature bottles of champagne. `` The name ` <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>' carries a lot of weight,'' said flight attendant <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, 33, an 11-year Eastern veteran. `` We're all very excited about it.'' At one point the billionaire businessman, who sat in the front row with Trump Shuttle President <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, grabbed the public address microphone to announce, `` Ladies and gentlemen, this is your flight attendant.'' Passengers arriving at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National Airport were met by a strings and accordion quintet, whose statuesque, blond violin player mugged with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for photographers. The shuttle's rebirth had been trumpted for days by newspaper and radio ads, touting <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s plans to rejuvenate the business that had been <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s only profitable enterprise before the company was crippled by a strike that began March 4. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> formally closed the deal in a signing ceremony at his opulent Plaza Hotel, buying the shuttle from strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for $ 365 million. The real estate and casino tycoon, with trademark bravado, pledged to make the Trump Shuttle `` the best transportation system in the world.'' `` I want the shuttle to be a diamond,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. He promised to spend as much as $ 2 million on each plane for refurbishing, safety checks and painting of the new color scheme: white fuselage with red, black and gold stripes, the name `` Trump'' above the stripes and a red `` T'' on the tail. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who will function as chairman and chief executive officer, called it `` the largest scheduled airline startup in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline history,'' with 21 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jets and more than 1,000 employees. Many of the pilots, flight attendants and mechanics worked for Eastern before the strike and were tentatively hired by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> starting last fall. The shuttle, which links <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, is used mainly by business travelers. It was Eastern's only consistent profit maker before the March 4 strike. Miami-based Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> formally approved the sale to Trump on May 25, after <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its rival $ 415 million buyout proposal because of failure to arrange financing. The Eastern shuttle lost many passengers to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s rival service because of the strike and now has less than a 25 percent market share. Full-page ads for the Trump Shuttle in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post and other East Coast papers Wednesday blared the message in giant letters: `` Starting Tomorrow, Business Travel Will Be Back on Schedule.'' The ads, as well as a similar radio version, announced that the Trump Shuttle will begin service at precisely 7 a.m. EDT today. `` Which means that now, you can go back to the time you prefer traveling _ on the hour,'' the newspaper ads read. `` What's more, when we say on the hour, we mean on the hour. Seven a.m. does not mean 7:01 a.m.'' Like Eastern did, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> promises to roll out another plane if the first one for a given hour is full. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle offers flights leaving on the half-hour. Not to be outdone, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> launched the `` Corporate Jet Game,'' a sweepstakes for passengers. The grand prize is free use of a 727 to fly the winner and 25 guests to a weekend trip in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. `` We think that we can out-Trump Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>. `` The battle will be won on service considerations.''

 <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> today confirmed it would refuse to obey the new production limits approved just a day earlier by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> told reporters <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has temporarily pulled out of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota system because the cartel failed to increase <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s share of total production in the last half of the year. But he insisted, `` We will use that freedom -LRB- from the quota system -RRB- very, very responsibly.'' The new agreement was designed to keep a firm grip on production in order to keep prices strong. Oil markets initially reacted with skepticsm to the cartel's ability to restrain output, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude prices appeared to stabilize somewhat today. <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> intended to produce 1.35 million barrels a day in the coming months, compared to its quota of 1.09 million barrels. Its current production is estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day or more. Other ministers appeared to accept <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s position. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> indicated that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s extra sales would be tolerated as long as they did not exceed 1.35 million barrels a day. After six days of bargaining, the cartel agreed to boost its output ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day in the July-December period, up a million barrels from the current level. They agreed to divide up the extra sales proportionately among all members. To meet the new ceiling, some of the countries will have to cut their production. Analysts estimate output has picked up in recent weeks to 21 million barrels a day. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said he would have liked the production cap set at 20 million barrels a day in the second half of the year, but he said several producers were worried a higher ceiling might have an impact on prices. The ministers agreed to meet again in September and decide whether to boost their output to 20 million barrels a day, beginning Oct. 1. The cartel has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrels a day in recent weeks, analysts say. So the producing nations would have to turn down their taps to meet the new supply level. `` Everybody is supposed to rein in production levels -LRB- to their assigned quota -RRB-,'' said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>. The members also decided to keep their benchmark price at $ 18 a barrel, about the current price of a basket of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON>, head of energy research at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the new arrangement should not `` have a signficant impact on gasoline prices at the pump.'' Production cutbacks made early in the year by the cartel have sent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline prices soaring. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, futures prices for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the American benchmark crude, closed down 79 cents to $ 19.67 a barrel on Wednesday, but the near-term contract was up 5 cents at midday. <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON> said prices fell because the markets figured the nations would continue producing at the present pace. `` Current -LRB- output -RRB- levels,'' he said, `` are a bit high to support a price over $ 20 ... so they took the price down about a dollar.'' In reaching an agreement, the organization rejected demands by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and others for a bigger share of the pie. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s insistence on a larger chunk caused talks to break down Tuesday. In pressing for a greater share of the increase, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was pitted against influential <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest crude exporter. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> wanted the increase shared on a pro-rata basis among all members. `` If it is found that the demand warrants an increase in the ceiling, then this can be raised to 20 million barrels per day or any other level agreed upon,'' said a statement released by the ministers. Any adjustments would be made Oct. 1. Prices have been much stronger than expected due to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cutbacks earlier in the year and accidents in key oil-producing regions restricting supply. The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the cartel exceeded the $ 18 reference earlier in the year. With the recent pickup in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production, prices have eased some but are still more than 40 percent higher than late last November. The ministers' statement said they intend to talk to independent producing nations `` with a view to soliciting their cooperation in support of market stability.'' Some of those countries agreed earlier in the year to curtail their output to help bolster prices. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s members are: <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, U.A.E. and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Wheat Price Firm Despite China Turmoil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> despite the continued concern over conditions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Early trading indicates wheat prices are firming, although analysts say traders are worried about delays in the shipment of wheat on order by the Chinese. But the market is largely ignoring the turmoil still evident in that nation and the possible impact it could have on future grain sales. Favorable weather outlooks are expected to put pressure on corn and soybean prices. However, soybean futures could get a boost from a threatened sales boycott by Brazilian farmers who say they are worried about their government's exchange rate policy. In addition, dockworkers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> are threatening another nationwide port strike, which would hamper that soybean exports. A strike by dockworkers last month shut down most Brazilian ports. In early trading, wheat was a -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.84 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.55 -RCB- a bushel; oats were a -LCB- cent to 1 cent higher with July at $ 1.63 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 8 cents higher with July at $ 7.19 a bushel. Livestock prices were mostly lower and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .33 cent lower to .23 cent higher with June at 69.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August at 78.87 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .18 cent lower with June at 48.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .23 cent to .30 cent higher with July at 32 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled higher Wednesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communciations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have an array of options to protect their planned merger deal despite <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 10.7 billion buyout offer for Time. Securities analysts expressed little doubt that Time would resist the unsolicited tender offer that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> launched only 2 -LCB- weeks before shareholders are to vote on the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger that would create the world's largest media and entertainment concern. Top executives of both Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> were said to be unavailable Wednesday for comment on what course they intend to take. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Appert </PERSON>, media analyst at C.J. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects Time officials `` will be pretty tough about trying to retain their independence.'' Paramount, the entertainment and publishing concern formerly called <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said late Tuesday it was launching a tender offer of $ 175 in cash for each of Time's shares. That bid prompted heavy trading Wednesday in the stock of all three companies. Time jumped $ 44 to close at $ 170 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.75 to $ 53.50 a share and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> rose 75 cents to $ 54.75 a share. At mid-day today, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> was down $ 2.75 to $ 167.75, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 1.12 -LCB- at $ 54.62 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> ws up $ 2.12 -LCB- at $ 56.87 -LCB-. Among the options securities analysts said Time was likely to be considering were making its own tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> or turning the tables on Paramount by making a `` Pac-Man'' takeover bid for the uninvited suitor. Analysts said Time previously arranged a $ 5 billion line of credit that could be used if a competing bidder emerged. The down side is that a buyout would dilute Time's earnings by saddling it with debt. They said Time could exercise of any of several takeover defenses, including a `` poison-pill'' that would make stock available to its shareholders at a bargain rate, making a hostile takeover more expensive. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> also could buy stakes in each other under terms of their merger plan, a move that would further dilute their stock and make a takeover of either of them more costly. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, media analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he does n't think the Paramount offer necessarily dooms the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger plan. But he said it is `` hard to envisage a shareholder vote taking place in two weeks while the Paramount offer is outstanding.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders are scheduled to vote June 23 on the merger. Paramount filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking to block Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> from exercising contingency plans designed to deter uninvited biddders from interfering with their merger. But a judge declined Wednesday to immediately grant <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s requests. Also Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said it had filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, seeking an order that would prevent the bank from providing or arranging the $ 14 billion in financing that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said the bank plans to arrange for its bid. The sum includes the cost of buying Time's shares, refinancing debt and other costs. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said it had an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> under which the bank had agreed not to help finance an unsolicted offer that would interfere with the merger between <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and Time. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, said it was not aware of `` any violation of any agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>.'' Paramount Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> met privately with securities analysts Wednesday, saying that while the deal would result in `` significantly lower'' earnings in the near term, the chance to buy <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> was `` a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to maximize <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term potential.'' He told the analysts he has no plans to sell any assets. Time, a publishing and cable giant, may have a tough job explaining to its shareholders how the proposed stock swap merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would be a better deal than the $ 175 a share in cash that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> is offering. Under the planned <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would get a share in the new company for each share they currently own while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would get 0.465 share of the new company for each <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> share. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, media analyst for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he estimated the combined company's stock would trade at about $ 110 a share. But he said that figure is not strictly comparable with the $ 175 a share price Paramount is offering, because anyone taking that offer would face a capital gains tax and would have to give up their stock to boot. `` Some credit has to be give to the idea of continuing to be an equity investor,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that it has received 18 firm orders valued at roughly $ 810 million for a stretched version of its A320 medium-range passenger jet. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>, head of the European commercial aircraft consortium, told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Show that orders include 12 planes for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and six for the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> state carrier <ORGANIZATION> Egyptair </ORGANIZATION>. The Airbus board gave preliminary approval to the stretched aircraft three weeks ago. The new plane will be called the A321-100. <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON> said he was confident that <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> will have the 40 firm orders it needs to proceed with the aircraft, but a decision is not expected until September. First deliveries of the new plane are expected to start in 1994. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> is a consortium among <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Construcciones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronauticas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, a major rival of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> in the multi-million dollar international commercial aircraft market, has booked orders for 200 aircraft since the beginning of this year, compared with 167 for all of 1988. `` Our goal of 400 orders by the end of 1989 is achievable,'' he said, adding that this would represent about $ 20 billions in new orders.

 The stock market showed a small gain today, squeezing a little more mileage out of its recent rally fueled by takeover news and rumors and declining interest rates.

<HEAD>Spending to Expand Business Production Seen Rising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 American businesses plan a strong 6.5 percent increase in plant and equipment spending this year, the government said Thursday, and economists said the investments would help economic expansion while tending to limit inflation. Analysts said much of the spending will involve equipment that would permit businesses to modernize their production capabilities, thereby reducing both costs and prices. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey, completed in May, business investment is now estimated at $ 451.43 billion for 1989, up from $ 423.69 billion in 1988. The numbers are adjusted for inflation. Although the economy has been slowing this year, business spending plans have been expanding. In an initial survey completed last December, businesses told the department they planned a 5.9 percent increase in expansion and modernization spending this year. A survey completed in March showed the forecast rising to 6.3 percent. `` Just about all of the increase is projected in equipment rather than physical plants,'' according to <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is good, in the sense that it shows that industry is aware that it has to improve product quality and reduce input costs,'' he said. `` To the extent that industry is more productive, it will hold down inflation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been putting upward pressure on interest rates for 15 months as it attempted to slow the economy and ease inflation. The spending forecast suggests the slowdown is not about to turn into recession. `` Basically this is a plus for the economy both in terms of continued expansion and, over the longer time, helping relieve pressure on capacity and therefore limit the extent that price pressures will accelerate,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said one drawback to the increased spending is that much of the new equipment is expected to be imported. `` So even as businesses become even more productive on the one side,'' <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said, `` on the other, they're adding to the balance of trade deficit.'' But at the same time, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, much of the spending to increase capacity is to meet expanding orders for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. Capital spending grew 10.1 percent in 1988 as companies rushed to expand production to meet rising export demand. That was the sharpest increase since a 16.6 percent hike in 1984, when businesses were still recovering from the 1981-82 recession. Since then, spending fell 3.9 percent in 1986 but rose 2.3 percent in 1987. Business investment in the manufacturing sector was forecast to increase 3.6 percent to $ 170.54 billion this year, compared to a 12.8 percent rise in 1988 That includes a 1.4 percent hike in industries producing durable goods, those expected to last three years or more. Non-durable spending was expected to rise 5.7 percent. Non-manufacturing spending in such industries as mining and transportation was seen rising 8.4 percent to $ 280.89 billion, compared with last year's 8.4 percent increase. Before adjusting for inflation, 1989 plant and equipment spending is expected to rise by 9.9 percent to $ 472.08 billion, down from 10.3 percent in 1988.

 Born in protest 54 years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union today advocates constructive teamwork with company bosses and it bargains contracts for professionals who range from clerks to jai alai ballplayers. The 1 million member union is discovering, as have manufacturers and other labor organizations, that peaceful coexistence and diversification can be keys to survival. The transition has come at a price. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> is taking an increasingly active role in running companies, from the board room to the factory floor. This has shaken the workings of a labor organization that up to now has largely avoided the factionalism plaguing some sister unions. As <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members prepare for a convention later this month, their agenda will include how to address a growing dissident movement that claims the union has forgotten the lessons of history. During the past three years, the New Directions movement has grown within the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> urging the organization's leaders to honor the axiom _ managers manage and workers work. New Directions leader <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> says the union is getting too chummy with management in developing team approaches to the job and assisting with problem-solving on the plant floor. It goes deeper than that, he says. `` I've been trying to force a debate on fundamentals from the start of this thing'' about five years ago, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> says. `` I'm relentless in my pursuit of answers to why certain hallowed principles have to be discarded And if they have to be discarded in favor of corporatist activity, what's in it for us?'' Jobs, says <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>. As times change, so must the union. That does n't mean the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> is n't prepared to fight companies. It's been building up a strike fund, which now totals $ 740 million and pays $ 100 a week and insurance coverage per worker during walkout `` They came up with the slogan of New Directions,'' he says. `` I must say that I fail to see that. I sort of equate them to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ I do n't know what that program is because nobody's explained that program.'' The drive of New Directions really is n't new at all, says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, director of the Office for the Study of <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> at the University of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` New Directions, despite their name, is very much oriented to the old ways,'' he says. The loosely knit group claims widespread shop-level support but declines to estimate it in numbers. In one sense, labor specialists agree, the union will benefit from the debate New Directions is forcing. The movement is by far the most serious and most public challenge to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leadership since the union's founding in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, on Aug. 26, 1935. `` It's good for the union to have a debate,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensman </PERSON>, director of the graduate program in labor studies at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` When you have people who are critical, it forces or gives the leadership more incentive to explain its policies to the members.'' That debate comes as the union looks outside the automobile industry for membership growth. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> has organized some state workers in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, university staff in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <PERSON> jai </PERSON> <PERSON> alai </PERSON> players in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. For years, it has represented aerospace, agricultural equipment and clerical workers. <PERSON> Riki </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasa </PERSON>, a professional <PERSON> jai </PERSON> <PERSON> alai </PERSON> player and president of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 8868, said his organization talked with other unions, including the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and the Hotel and Restaurant Employees, before deciding in June 1988 to affiliate with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>. `` They spoke about the democracy within the union that we, the players, make our decisions,'' <PERSON> Lasa </PERSON> says. The 500 players are continuing a strike that began April 14, 1988 over claims that management violated federal labor laws. The jai alai players are seeking their first contract with management. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> also has been looking outside the auto industry in advertising campaigns that have cost the union $ 20 million during the 1980s. The most recent campaign, running in large media markets and costing the union about $ 4 million, reminds Americans of labor's role in building the economy and criticizes financiers to make quick profits on takeovers Some doubt the ad's effectiveness. `` They probably make the people who run them feel better,'' says ad analyst <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s outside recruiting success has n't been matched in the newest segment of the auto industry _ `` transplants'' from abroad. Japanese companies, and joint ventures between Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers, have been erecting carmaking plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1982. Some now are expanding. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> has organized workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and two joint ventures _ the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> factory by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler-Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill But workers in <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, assembly plants are n't unionized `` Nobody will admit this,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> says, `` but there ca n't be any secret as to why they located any of these plants out there in the hinterlands. It's also no accident that most of the people who got hired probably had their ancestry checked through at least three generations to find out whether anyone ever belonged to a union or not. `` We've had an extremely tough time in organizing, and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> was a good example,'' he said. In March 1986 in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, on the eve of a representation election, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> _ fearing defeat _ withdrew its bid to unionize the workers. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON>, a labor professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, says worker boredom could help bring more transplants into the union fold. `` I think they will be organized, I think when they will be organized is hard to gauge,'' he says. In the late 1970s, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> had more than 1.5 million members. Today, it stands at 1 million, a decline that is a trend in organized labor. Union workers also have become more conservative, partly because of the popularity of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a tremendous hold on our membership,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, now a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` He was kind of a macho man and the blue-collar worker is sort of a macho fellow and that had a great attraction for them. `` Also I think that some of our members thought that the union leadership and the liberals were too caught up in equal rights, and the other factor is that I believe that as their income increases their values change.'' The base hourly wage for an auto assembler is about $ 14.50 an hour, among the highest of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factory worker today. When health and other benefits are included, annual compensation is about $ 37,000, more with overtime. Of that, workers pay the equivalent of two hours pay per month in dues.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with closing prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices closed sharply higher in heavy trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid a favorable economic background and some institutional buying. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 25.5 points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 2,143.4. The index moved in positive territory throughout the day, recording a minimum gain of 12.4 points shortly after the opening and then surging as much as 36.6 points around midday. Volume was heavy, as 782.3 million shares changed hands. But much of the turnover was concentrated in a handful of special situation stocks. By comparison, volume was 481 million shares Wednesday. A steady pound and a recovery in long-term British government bond prices, following last week's sell-off, provided a favorable background for equity prices to move higher, dealers said. In addition, some institutions stepped in with selective buying. Various takeover rumors also made the rounds, centering on some of the market's larger capitalized companies, pushing up prices and inflating turnover in selected stocks.

 The stock market pushed ahead today, squeezing a little more mileage out of its recent rally fueled by takeover news and rumors and declining interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 31.62 points over the last two sessions, rose another 6.25 to 2,518.57 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 751 up, 649 down and 541 unchanged. New takeover bids this week for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> touched off buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible future candidates for acquisitions or buyouts. <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, said to be a potential target, climbed -RCB- to 51 \ Time stock, meanwhile, dropped 2 -RCB- to 167 \ and <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> lost 2 -LCB- to 127 in the over-the-counter market after both experienced dramatic runups in Wednesday's trading <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, the volume leader among <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issues, fell 2 \ to 44 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, which had been considered a possible bidder for <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, sold its stake of 11.7 million shares in a block at 45 \ <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, which reaped a profit on the investment, gained 1 to 81. Beyond the takeover hubbub, analysts say the market has benefited from signs this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be starting a change of course in its credit policy. After more than a year of tightening credit conditions, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is widely believed to have made an initial step toward easing, by permitting a decline in the interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks. Energy stocks were mostly lower amid skepticism that members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would adhere to new oil production quotas set this week. Exxon dropped -LCB- to 43 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to 49 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 43 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> 1 -RCB- to 91 |, and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 53 -RCB- The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks edged up .02 to 182.36.

 <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> said Thursday it will pump extra crude in the coming months in defiance of the latest <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production accord, and other cartel members could follow suit. Just a day after an agreement was reached, Kuwaiti Oil Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> said his country has temporarily withdrawn from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s quota system because other ministers failed to increase its share of total production in the last half of the year. Other members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries appeared to accept <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s decision to cheat on the new agreement. In fact, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and a few others were considered likely to ignore their output limits. They, too, wanted a bigger share of the production pie. But <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> said, `` I think that all countries have committed themselves to something. That's what's positive.'' It was <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s insistence on a higher share of increased production that stalled negotiations for a new accord. <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said he wrote in the new agreement that he would not feel bound by his new quota. But he also told reporters that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> `` will use that freedom -LRB- from the quota system -RRB- very, very responsibly.'' In restraining supply in the past, he said, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has `` sacrificed more than the others for a very, very long time. ... But there is a limit to what we can do.'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> intended to produce 1.35 million barrels a day in the coming months, noting that it is `` almost physically impossible'' to pump less than that in part because of commitments to long-time customers. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s new new quota is 1.09 million barrels, and its current supply is estimated at nearly 2 million barrels. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> indicated to a small group of reporters that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s extra sales would be tolerated as long as they did not exceed 1.35 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON> noted <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> would have to make cutbacks to come down to the promised level. `` The accord is even better than what we could have dreamed of,'' he said. `` This is the maximum that we could have.'' After six days of bargaining, the cartel agreed to boost its supply ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day in the July-December period. While that is up a million barrels from the current official level, analysts estimated output in recent weeks has risen to 21 million barrels a day. The ministers agreed to divide the extra sales proportionately among all members. To meet the new ceiling, some countries will have to cut production. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said he would have liked to see the ceiling upped to 20 million barrels a day in the last half of the year, but he noted that `` several of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members were just afraid it may have an impact on price.'' The ministers said in a statement the ceiling could be raised to 20 million barrels a day or more, effective Oct. 1, if demand remained strong. `` I honestly feel that demand in the market is much stronger,'' <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON> agreed, saying that if prices hold steady, `` there is no reason not to add another 500,000 barrels a day'' to the cap. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> retained in the new agreement its benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel. The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was nearly $ 17.70 a barrel last week. The new accord was designed to keep a firm grip on production so that prices would remain robust. But oil markets reacted skeptically to the cartel's ability to limit output. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude prices initially tumbled but recovered somewhat on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are: <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuella </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>China Turmoil Damages Foreign Business Confidence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Foreign businesses' confidence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been shattered by the eruption of violence. `` It will take years to restore credibility,'' <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> VanDenBerg </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that commercial and economic relations between the countries `` have been disrupted and could suffer long-term damage.'' The business council said its members `` deplore the violent suppression and wanton killing of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'' and said the countries should `` preserve the links between us until they can again be expanded.'' While some businesses away from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> continue to do business as normal, many report they have been crippled by workers staying home and expatriates leaving the country. Many companies that had been attracted by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cheap labor and huge potential market have been forced into a wait-and-see attitude, hoping their investments will survive. <ORGANIZATION> Kumigai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gumi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese construction company, has stopped work on a 51-story skyscraper in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> because of the danger. `` We do n't know when we can resume the project,'' an official said. `` It does n't look like it's going to be any time soon.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it is continuing to operate two toy plants in <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, 1,500 miles from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which make clothes for Barbie dolls and some Disney-theme pre-school toys. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ordered 51 employees and dependents at an airliner assembly plant outside <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to leave the country Tuesday, said <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' top Asia-based executive in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Workers were n't aware of the turmoil that had engulfed the country because of the government's news blackout, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the company has 120 employees in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supplying and maintaining computers. Half are foreigners, he said, and all but two of those had left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Thursday. `` The office is technically open, but if someone needs service, it would depend on the situation whether we could help,'' he said. `` I wonder what business is to be had,'' <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> added. About 30 American staffers of an <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> coal mine in north-central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-chartered evacuation flight from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Thursday. They declined to give their names to a reporter at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> airport, but said there had not been any trouble at the mine. The danger of being on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> streets caused <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to tell some 100 workers to remain at home and not report to their jobs at a joint venture plant in the capital making electronic calculators, <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Itagaki </PERSON> said the company had no problems at a project giving technical assistance to a steel plant near <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, and its exports of steel products to 10 Chinese cities were going ahead normally. <ORGANIZATION> Yokogawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading Japanese manufacturer of industrial instruments, shut a joint venture factory in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shaaxi </LOCATION> province, early this week, said spokesman <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON>. The 260 workers `` are participating in rallies in protest against the military suppression in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON> said. `` Even students and workers from other factories are coming to call for a series of major protest rallies. ... Some circles in the city are calling for a general strike.'' Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, speaking in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, said, `` It can not be denied that the international image of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been impaired a lot.'' <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, where for five years the government has urged businessmen to boost trade ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, also expressed worry that the violence could damage <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` open door'' economic policy of welcoming foreign investment. After hearing of the violence early this week, Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> said, `` We hope wiser counsels will prevail to pursue conciliation, so that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people can resume the progress which the open door policies have brought them.'' The turmoil has caused some price jumps for commodities exported by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, such as peanuts, soybeans and silk cocoons.

<HEAD>Singapore Firms Brace For China Business Upheaval</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 They do n't recognize each other diplomatically, but the world's largest developing country and one of the smallest and most prosperous had been seeking mutual benefits from investment and tourism. Now, bankers and businessmen in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> who followed official calls to try to exploit the vast market in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are bracing for serious disruption and possible losses. Over the last five years, the government urged businessmen to bolster their established trade ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> through direct investments in manufacturing and hotel concerns. In addition, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> lifted travel restrictions on its citizens visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after a process of gradual easing that began in the early 1980s. The drive to strengthen business ties coincided with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s appointment in 1985 of <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Keng </PERSON> <PERSON> Swee </PERSON> as an adviser to help develop coastal economic zones <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s former deputy prime minister and is widely credited with the country's industrial transformation in the 1970s. Hopes of exploiting <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s open-door economic policy are stalled and almost certainly will be reassessed after the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` A <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with large sections of her people, including her best educated, at odds with the government means trouble with people resentful, reforms stalled and economy stagnant,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> said after hearing of the initial violence. `` Because of her size, such a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could create problems for herself and her neighbors in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> is a small island nation more than 1,000 miles south of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We hope wiser counsels will prevail to pursue conciliation, so that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people can resume the progress which the open door policies have brought them,'' the prime minister said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien </PERSON> <PERSON> Loong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s trade and industry minister and the prime minister's eldest son, offered his country two years ago as an efficient go-between for international traders seeking contacts in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We can smooth the way for the international business community to do business with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and we can also help, albeit in a small way, to further modernize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien </PERSON> <PERSON> Loong </PERSON> said this thriving country was a useful commercial gateway because of formal agreements already in place. These promise to protect investments by the Singapore-based subsidiaries of multinationals, avoid double taxation and guarantee the entry of goods and services into the Chinese market. Tourism officials in 1987 started promoting <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a complementary destination to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. One objective was to persuade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travel agents to arrange package tours featuring <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as joint destinations with common attractions. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> connection goes back to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s founding as as British colonial trading post in 1819, when it became a magnet for migrating Chinese peasants. The population is 2.6 million, about 76 percent of whom are ethnic Chinese, and Mandarin is one of four official languages. Despite being only slightly larger than <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fifth largest export market after <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, much of it for re-export to the rest of southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Trade between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> quardrupled in the past decade to $ 2.25 billion last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has advised all Singaporeans to leave <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> advised businessmen to postpone trips to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. After the Feb. 23 announcement that <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would restore diplomatic ties within a year, officials said <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> would follow suit within a few months. Officials declined to comment on whether the turmoil would delay that.

The three blockbuster fraud cases epitomized the success of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in exposing financial skulduggery and toughening securities law enforcement standards in the 1980s. Now, with the federal agency's enforcement chief, chairman and several other top officials stepping down, what can the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> do for an encore? `` I think what we have seen is some very good cops and robbers work,'' said <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> commissioner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundfest </PERSON>, who has announced he's leaving in mid-1990 to teach at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The division has scored bull's eyes with big cases.'' The direct hits constituted a domino effect that thrust the 55-year-old federal agency charged with policing the nation's financial markets into the spotlight during a wildly prosperous decade whose handmaiden was scandal A tip about suspicious trading practices at a Bahamian bank eventually led to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> investment banker <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who in 1986 agreed to relinquish $ 12.6 million in insider trading profits and penalties. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> cooperated with the government and ratted on speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who paid $ 100 million in forbidden profits and penalties for insider trading and named names, including <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and its junk-bond impresario <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is paying $ 650 million in fines and restitution; <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has been indicted for fraud and racketeering and could face even bigger financial punishment. Those cases, along with a calm response to the 1987 stock market crash, raised the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s stature and stirred calls in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to boost funding for an agency that raises for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> nearly three times its annual budget. But with most of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> matter resolved, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Enforcement Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said he is leaving in July after four years atop the agency police squad. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appointee, is stepping down to return to teaching, which will allow President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to shape the agency. Besides <PERSON> Grundfest </PERSON>, the other three commissioners are rumored on the way out; two are serving without <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation and one, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischman </PERSON>, is said to be considering resigning if he is n't named to succeed <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>. All that should point to a period of transition and uncertainty at the Washington-based agency founded during the Depression in response to the Crash of 1929. But staffers and outsiders said enforcement groundwork laid down by <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> should ensure a smooth continuation. `` The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> really has a very strong sense of continuity,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON>, a securities law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a lot like the British government. The prime minister may change but the people in the bureaucracy tend to be the same over time.'' `` There's no need to bring in anyone to clean things up or change direction radically,'' he said. `` Things have continued to work pretty much as usual,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>, an associate enforcement director and a top candidate for <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s job. `` There is some level of anticipation about who the new chairman will be and who the director of the division will be,'' he said. `` It's not a paralyzing kind of thing, just the kind of thing you'd normally expect to be on people's minds. Aside from the new leadership, two factors could dictate whether the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> remains in the spotlight. One is the direction of the economy, which historically influences the nature of financial crime. The other is whether the domino effect continues and the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case produces another high-profile bust. `` A legitimate question is, what's going to be the next <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> or is there going to be a next <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>?'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy chief litigation counsel, who helped handle the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case. `` Historically the pattern has been that each of these cases starting with <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> has led to several others,'' he said. `` A question is, is this going to end some time or is this going to keep continuing? I do n't know, I really do n't.'' The bull market of the 1980s with large numbers of mergers and acquisitions led the commission to cases in which Wall Streeters used advance information of takeover activity to illegally trade in securities: insider trading. But if the economy slows as many experts predict _ merger activity already is showing a sharp decline _ the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> could uncover more financial disclosure improprieties as companies try to cut corners or tinker with statements. `` It's human nature not to want to disclose the bad news unless one's forced to,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturc </PERSON>, an associate enforcement director who also is in the running for the top job. `` We had a lot of financial disclosure cases arising out of the' 81 -'82 The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> already is devoting more resources to fraud in cheap, over-the-counter securities known as penny stocks. Experts also predict more cases involving overseas transactions, a reflection of the enforcement division's liaisons with foreign government counterparts. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staffers said the agency's general enforcement philosophy changed in the early 1980s to concentrate more on the market process and financial reporting and less on tangential legal issues. Along with that came a more militant stance on sanctions, including stiffer penalties in all cases and tough compliance provisions, such as oversight powers against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. There also has been more cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in filing related criminal cases, such as with <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. `` My impression is that the commission in general felt a need for more significant sanctions against people who violate the law in the civil context,'' said <PERSON> Sturc </PERSON>, 39, who has worked in the enforcement division seven years. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is n't without problems. Staffing has increased by just 4 percent in the 1980s to around 2,130, while the commission's responsibilities, workload and enforcement actions have soared Sales on the nation's securities exchanges have risen to $ 2.1 trillion from about $ 540 billion in 1980. The number of brokerage firms jumped to 11,900 from 6,750 and of brokers and dealers to 480,000 from 196,000 in the same period. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> collected $ 252 million in filing fees in fiscal 1988, up more than four times from 1980, but its budget, at $ 143 million, has n't even doubled. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is seeking $ 168.7 million for fiscal 1990, and has support from many congressmen who have sermonized about financial irregularity. The commission also is seeking to boost salaries for its 800 staff attorneys, partly to halt a high turnover rate. First-year <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers make $ 27,172, a third or quarter of what top law firms offer. `` It's a chronic problem but it's become dramatically acute,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Iason </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, where staffing has been cut from from about 240 to 200 in recent years. `` There are greater demands on our resources and we have fewer resources.''

In addition, dockworkers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> are threatening another nationwide port strike, which would hamper that nation's soybean exports, <PERSON> Kouba </PERSON> said. A strike by dockworkers last month shut down most Brazilian ports. Corn prices were pressured by light demand and reports of improved growing conditions in major crop areas.

 When <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> engineered an industry record $ 566 million purchase of the parent of the <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> advertising agency two summers ago, he called it the `` opportunity of a lifetime.'' But opportunity seems to have knocked more often than the bespectacled 44-year-old financial maven foresaw. His <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> verges on a larger takeover, the $ 864 million buyout of another <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> icon, <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. In his three years at <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> - and Harvard-educated son of a British retailing executive has built a global communications empire He's done it by adding more than three dozen advertising, public relations and marketing services firms to the framework of a company that still makes wire shopping baskets and plastic dish drainers. The Ogilvy deal, expected to close within weeks, will make <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> the world's second biggest advertising and marketing company, trailing only <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> toiled nine years as the top financial officer <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> has said the <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> purchase will make his company the world's finest advertising and marketing services company, but eschews any interest in surpassing <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> as the largest. His rapid rise to the top of the advertising-marketing industry has left some people gushing at what they call his business genius and others describing him as arrogant and vindictive. <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle for more than a year with a half dozen former executives of the ad agency Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> acquired as part of the <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> deal. The Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> executives, including agency founders <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, walked out in March 1988 to form their own agency after chafing under eight months of <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> ownership. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Geier </PERSON>, chairman of the advertising conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Interpublic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, has criticized <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> for his unsolicited advances against both <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s assault on <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> exposed <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> as a financial gambler who has `` taken a major company that was doing fine and leveraged it to the hilt.'' <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> is using a combination of stock and debt to finance the <LOCATION> Ogilvy </LOCATION> takeover. People close to <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> say <PERSON> Geier </PERSON> may be biased since <ORGANIZATION> Interpublic </ORGANIZATION> failed in its eleventh-hour bid to wrest Ogilvy from <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s grasp by proposing a stock swap. Several top executives of the packaging, design, sales promotion and corporate identity firms that <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> has acquired say they are delighted with the deals. They speak glowingly of the opportunities <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> created for their businesses by associating them with a prestigious name like <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and by imposing financial discipline they individually lacked. <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition `` was the best thing that ever happened to <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounian </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Reese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a 20-year-old marketing concern based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> In a manner typical of <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON>'s approach in acquiring privately held companies, <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> bought <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> in September 1987 for an initial payment of $ 14 million in cash and a promise to pay up to $ 21 million more depending on earnings performance over the next several years. The approach, which <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> honed during his days at <LOCATION> Saatchi </LOCATION>, enables <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> to hold onto the management of the companies it acquires by giving them a continuing stake in the success of the firm. <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> stays out of the day-to-day operations of <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s companies, but has them file daily financial reports and holds them accountable for meeting performance goals `` The critical thing is what questions you ask,'' <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> said in an interview following the <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> acquisition in 1987. `` If you ask certain things, people in giving you the answers will ask themselves, ` Why did they ask me that question?' Good things come out of that if you are asking the right questions.'' <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Pounian </PERSON> said officials at her company rarely had time to ask themselves the financial questions <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> asks, and she welcomes the discipline. `` Is it a picnic in the park every day? No. ... But the benefits so outweigh the minor inconveniences that there is no question we are in a better position than we would have been,'' she said. <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON>, who pronounces his name with the accent on the first syllable, was born on Valentine's Day in 1945. His father ran the retail division of a large British industrial concern, and the youngster worked in its credit department when he was 16. He studied economics at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and earned an MBA from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. One <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> classmate, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> Still </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, remembers <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> as `` very incisive ... very bright'' and a standout in finance. `` If he believed in something, he would persist,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> recalls. After <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION> Glendinning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a marketing consulting firm in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Later bosses included sports promoter <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> and food retailer and investor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulliver </PERSON>, both in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> It was while working for <PERSON> Gulliver </PERSON> that he met the <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> brothers. They hired <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> as their top financial officer in 1977 and the firm grew rapidly in the following nine years. <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> struck out on his own in 1986 as chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Plastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, precursor of <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. He lives in <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, near the north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> neighborhood where he grew up. He and his wife have three sons, and <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> spends his free time with them, sometimes skiing or playing cricket.

<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy judge Thursday stripped <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s management of its exclusive right to file a plan to bring the company out of Chapter 11 protection. Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON>'s action means any creditor can file a plan to compete with one filed by the company's management. Reasons for the decision were not given, but the move came after the about 10 days after <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> filed its fifth plan since entering Chapter 11 in February 1988. Its unsecured creditors are owed $ 220 million. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s lenders and unsecured creditors immediately said they would file reorganization plans of their own. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s most recent plan was to bring its <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, the profitable small appliance maker that includes virtually all of <PERSON> Allegheny </PERSON>'s operating companies, out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy separately from the parent company. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, an attorney representing company stockholders, said <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON>'s action `` just made getting the financing impossible'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> plan. The last reorganization plan for <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> would have paid cash to settle all of the approximately $ 240 million in claims pending against the subsidiary. It would have left the Pittsburgh-based parent still in bankruptcy court to haggle with creditors. After collapse of the fourth reorganization plan, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said the judge was so aggravated that he suspended payment of most fees to attorneys and accountants involved in the case.

<HEAD>Crude, Gas Futures Finish Higher; Heating Oil Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices rose Thursday, rebounding from the previous session's sharp selloff. Home heating oil futures finished lower, depressed by sluggish demand typical for this time of year. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for July delivery of unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent to 64 cents a gallon, after Wednesday's loss of 1.60 cents. The July contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled at $ 20 per 42-gallon barrel, a gain of 33 cents for the day. The crude contract had dropped 79 cents Wednesday. But the selling continued in the heating oil pits, although not as aggressively as on Wednesday. July-delivery No. 2 heating oil fell by 0.05 cent to 48.66 a gallon, adding a minor amount to Wednesday's loss of 2.29 <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, an energy broker at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the buying of gasoline futures to renewed demand, particularly for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> harbor delivery gasoline, at the beginning of the peak summer driving season. `` As the value of gas moves up, so will crude,'' said <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>. `` Heating oil got left in the dust, which is understandable from a seasonal perspective.'' Crude also got a boost from buying in reaction to the tumble prices took Wednesday when the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting disappointed the markets. Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ageed to boost the cartel's production ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day in the July-December period. The new ceiling is 1 million barrels per day higher than the current level but below the estimated daily output in recent weeks of about 21 million barrels. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers also decided during their <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting to divide the extra production proportionately among all members. Analysts said this means that some countries will have to curtail some pumping to keep within their self-imposed quotas. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and several other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members have indicated they intend to pump more crude than their quotas allow and energy brokers doubt <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will be able to control production enough to maintain strong prices.

 The stock market churned ahead Thursday, squeezing a little more mileage out of its recent rally fueled by takeover news and rumors and declining interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.59 to 2,516.91, bringing its gain over the past three sessions to 36.21 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 842 up, 652 down and 510 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 212.31 million shares, against 213.71 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 249.77 million shares. The Dow finished the day just short of last Friday's post-crash high of 2,517.83 and still more than 200 points below its 1987 peak. However, the index at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reached a record high, topping its best levels recorded in the summer of'87. New takeover bids this week for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> touched off buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible future candidates for acquisitions or buyouts. <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, said to be a potential target, climbed -RRB- to 50 ~ in heavy trading Time stock, meanwhile, dropped 2 to 168 and <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> lost 4 -LCB- to 125 in the over-the-counter market after both experienced dramatic runups in Wednesday's trading. <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, the volume leader among <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issues, fell 2 to 44 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, which had been considered a possible bidder for <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, sold its stake of 11.7 million shares in a block at 45 \ <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, having reaped a healthy profit on the investment, gained 4 | to 84 Beyond the takeover hubbub, analysts say the market has benefited from signs this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be starting a change of course in its credit policy. After more than a year of tightening credit conditions, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is widely believed to have made an initial step toward easing, by permitting a decline in the interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks. Energy stocks were mostly lower amid skepticism that members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would adhere to new oil production quotas set this week.

 The dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies Thursday in light trading ahead of Friday's release of figures on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale price inflation. Gold prices moved lower. The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and French franc but fell against other major currencies.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> say they do n't argue in the cockpit, which their friends jokingly warn them about, and they plan to continue flying together for <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s new Northeast shuttle. The two, both former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots who signed with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> late last year, are happy to be working again. They are among 170 Eastern pilots who now work for the casino-property billionaire. `` It's a golden opportunity. Everyone is excited,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, a flight engineer celebrating her 27th birthday Thursday at the Trump Shuttle's debut. She had been working for Eastern for only a year and a half when employees struck the Miami-based carrier on March 4. For co-pilot husband <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, 42, who had flown for Eastern for 10 years, the heady enthusiasm of the occasion was tempered with nostalgia. `` We'll always have a kinship to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' he told a reporter in the crowded Trump Shuttle terminal at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` That's our roots. Eastern is a great group of people.'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said he was relieved, however, that the three-month `` emotional roller coaster'' of striking Eastern was over for the couple. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, unlike Eastern boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, is n't in a `` confrontational position'' with employees, he said. The couple are relocating from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Other Trump Shuttle pilots, who had come from carriers other than <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, were less prone to looking back. `` The potential is so much greater here,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Woermann </PERSON>, 43, comparing his new job favorably with his former employer <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, a regional airline based in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` I think it's a great opportunity.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 28, came to fly for Trump from <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a commuter line based in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, which suspended all operations in March.

<TEXT>
 Forty Chinese nationals were ordered banned from <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suspension of military dealing with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the company said Thursday. The Chinese nationals, mostly engineers, were working on a project to modernize electronics in the Chinese fighter plane. The Chinese were notified at a meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> corporate headquarters on Wednesday that they would not be permitted on Grumman property after 5 p.m. that day, said the spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>. They were told to turn in the identification badges allowing them on the premises in <LOCATION> Bethpage </LOCATION>. As of Thursday, they were waiting instructions from their government, <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> said. Grumman is the prime contractor on the largest U.S.-Chinese military project. The company was formally told by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s order no Chinese nationals were to be allowed into the plant. `` The Chinese were very upset,'' said <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>. `` They had a feeling they had been let down.'' The Chinese, many of whom had been working at <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> since 1987, had built up strong relationships with their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts, according to <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> employees. They had been to parties and barbecues at the homes of many of the Grumman workers. Now they feel cut off because they have had no contact with officials in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the workers said. All of the Chinese are here without family and are renting apartments or houses on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We have told them if they need anything of a personal nature that they should call us,'' said <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>. Grumman officials do not know if the project will be eventually canceled. Grumman was awarded a $ 500 million <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contract to develop and modernize a weapons control system for 55 existing F-8 Chinese fighters. The Chinese had contracted with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Air force. Grumman had 250 employees working on the program. Those employees will be shifted to other projects or layed-off, said <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>. Grumman, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s largest employer, employs some 19,000 people on the island.

<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended May 29, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,077.1 billion from $ 3,072.6 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,958.3 billion from $ 3,953.5 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 773.9 billion from $ 772.3 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,077.7 billion, a 1.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,953.8 billion, up 3.6 percent, while M1 fell 3.5 percent to an average of $ 781.1 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 813 million in the week ended May 31 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 464 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 534 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves averaged $ 665 million in the two weeks ended May 31, up from a revised $ 324 million in the previous two-week period _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 289.2 billion in the two-week period ended May 31, down from $ 289.6 billion two weeks earlier

 Here are some facts and figures about the Securities and Exchange Commission:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HISTORY: The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1934 as part of the Securities Exchange Act in a wave of financial regulation under President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> reacting to the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent Depression. DUTIES: The Washington-based commission is charged with regulating the nation's financial markets and market professionals, including all stock exchanges, brokers and investment firms. It regulates financial disclosures by companies and enforces federal securities laws. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is run by a panel of five commissioners, including a chairman. It has a total staff of about 2,130, including 800 attorneys, in 13 cities: <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The commission has the power to penalize securities-law violators with fines, suspensions and oversight. It can refer cases to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for criminal prosecution. In 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> brought 252 enforcement actions, including insider trading, corporate reporting, market manipulation, fraud and other cases. It also reviewed 10,985 disclosure filings, 4,000 more than in 1983. FINANCING: The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had a budget of $ 142.6 million, up from $ 73 million in 1980 It has requested $ 168.7 million for fiscal 1990. In 1987, the commission raised about $ 264 million from stock registration fees and $ 121 million from court orders to defendants to return illicit profits. Under federal securities laws, though, the agency can not use any of the money it raises.

<HEAD>Cable Companies Defend Ownership Of Programming Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cable television operators are not stopping their viewers from seeing independent programming, according to a study released Thursday that was paid for by the operators. When cable companies hold financial stakes in program services such as Home Box Office, Showtime or <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> they do n't try to keep their viewers from seeing non-affiliated networks such as <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, the study said. These large cable operators also do n't refuse to license their program services to competing delivery systems such as microwave and backyard satellite dishes, according to the study by <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s study disputed assertions that giant cable operators such as <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- use their size to discriminate against program networks they do not own. He said that although these companies are more inclined to carry the program services in which they have a stake, they also are more likely than other cable operators to carry programming in which they have no investment. But more importantly to cable TV viewers, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said, cable operators' willingness to invest in programming networks, a practice known as `` vertical integration,'' has led to `` an increased variety of programming choices not previously available to television consumers.'' `` As this landmark report illustrates, cable's investment in programming has enabled our industry to offer consumers a new and better type of television,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> released the report less than a week before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee was scheduled to begin hearings on increased concentration of media ownership. It did not say how much <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was paid for it. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, has proposed that no single company may own cable systems that reach more than 25 percent of the nation's cable households, similar to federal regulations on over-the-air broadcasters. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> also has proposed a bill that would prevent cable operators who hold financial interests in program services from denying the services to competitors such as `` wireless cable'' -LRB- microwave -RRB- companies. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> studied 400 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cable systems of varying sizes and markets and found that vertically integrated multiple-system operators `` are somewhat more likely to carry networks in which they have an ownership interest.'' However, he said this effect is generally small because the vertically integrated companies have ownership interests in relatively few networks compared to the 40, 50 or even 120 channels they may carry. He said four large, vertically integrated cable operators _ <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Viacom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> _ have ownership interests in an average 7.8 program networks among the top 28 networks, whereas he said the average cable system has 43 channels. <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION> has interests in Cable News Network, The Discovery Channel, Headline News and SuperStation TBS. <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> and has stakes in <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, Movietime and TBS. <ORGANIZATION> Viacom </ORGANIZATION>'s interests include <PERSON> Showtime </PERSON>, The Movie Channel, <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nickelodeon </PERSON> and VH-1, while <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> has interests in American Movie Classics, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> found that on average the most popular networks are carried by 5.1 percent more of the cable systems owned by the four vertically integrated companies than they are by 153 non-affiliated cable systems in the study. Cable systems owned by the four large companies carried Lifetime 17.1 percent more than non-affiliated cable systems; they carried <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> 2.4 percent more; <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> 4.6. percent more; and <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> equally -LRB- 100 percent -RRB- VH-1 was carried 7 percent less by the four large companies, and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> was carried 6.2 percent less by the four companies. The four companies provide service to 19 million, or about 39 percent, of the nation's 48.6 million cable subscribers, which <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said was not a large enough slice of the cable audience to allow them to prevent entry of new programming networks.

A special <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board committee rejected the bid by a group of investors that includes <ORGANIZATION> MEI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, MEI President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said in a news release. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> could not be reached by telephone for further comment late Thursday. MEI, a Minneapolis-based snack foods company, submitted a bid of about $ 3.3 billion, or about $ 110 a share, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday, quoting unidentified sources. A special <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board committee rejected all bids earlier this week after finding none acceptable. Board members have declined comment on the bids and have not released information to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> management, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a spokesman for the airline. The other known bidders for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> are oil billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 20,000-member machinists' union and an investment group led by former hotel executive <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> The committee asked for new bids by 4 p.m. EST June 16, and said bids should be held open until June 30 to give the committee time to evaluate the revised proposals, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> was quoted by the Journal as saying an investment in an airline was an option, as MEI seeks to diversify. `` We're looking for areas outside the snack food business and we're sitting on a great deal of cash,'' he said. As of Dec. 31, MEI showed $ 123 million in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, most of which came from a 1987 equity and debt offering, the Journal said. MEI reported revenue, primarily from sales of nuts, candies and other snack foods, of $ 219.9 million last year and earnings of $ 6.7 million, or 35 cents a share, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> banker, is a member of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board and has been involved in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' efforts to reorganize <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Minstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, recently joined <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to bid for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Forbes magazine lists <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON>'s personal net worth at $ 670 million and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' as $ 240 million <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> did not return phone calls Thursday. In another development Thursday, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> announced that his $ 2.67 billion, or $ 90 per share, tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was extended to 6 p.m. EDT, June 14. The offer previously was scheduled to expire at 6 p.m. EDT June 7. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> originally made his offer in March and has extended the deadline several times. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 87 -LCB- cents a share to $ 108.12 -LCB- Thursday following a gain of $ 1 a share the previous day amid the new takeover reports.

<HEAD>Grain Prices Continue to Tumble</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices declined Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> due to continued pressure from favorable weather forecasts and slack demand. On other markets, copper prices were up while precious metals were down; energy prices rallied; livestock and meat futures were down, and sugar and cotton prices rose. Wheat futures, which have been declining because of the political turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, were off for the third consecutive trading session. Analysts say the problems in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may mean that country wo n't place new orders for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. `` There was some concern over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and additional wheat sales, but the market lacked any real direction,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouba </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said Thursday. Soybean futures were mixed, getting a boost from a threatened sales boycott by Brazilian farmers who say they are worried about their government's exchange rate policy. In addition, dockworkers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> are threatening another nationwide port strike, which would hamper Brazilian soybean exports. Corn prices were pressured by light demand and reports of improved growing conditions in major crop areas. Wheat settled \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.81 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5 cents lower with July at $ 2.53 \ a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.65 a bushel; soybeans were 5 -RCB- cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $ 7.14 a bushel Copper futures moved higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on speculation about supply disruptions. The start of contract talks next week between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers and their unions, with the possibility of strikes, and the continued closure of <ORGANIZATION> Bougainville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s Papua, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> mine boosted prices, said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Copper settled 1.10 cents to 2.50 cents higher with June at $ 1.35 a pound. Precious metals prices declined as the dollar showed renewed strength. Gold settled $ 2.60 to $ 3.10 lower with June at $ 373.50 a troy ounce; silver was 2.1 cents to 2.7 cents lower with June at $ 5.443 a troy ounce. Energy futures mostly were higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to promises by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to cut back oil production. Kuwaiti Oil Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> said his country intended to produce 1.35 million barrels a day in coming months. On Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> signed a new production accord that placed <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s new quota at 1.093 million barrels. Its current output is estimated at nearly 2 million barrels a day. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 12 cents to 33 cents higher with July at $ 20 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent lower to .17 cent higher with July at 48.66 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .57 cent to .66 cent higher with July at 64 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures were mixed in lackluster trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .50 cent higher with June at 69.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .15 cent higher with August at 79.02 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .15 cent higher with June at 48.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .52 cent higher with July at 32.25 cents a pound. Sugar futures were up strongly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The political tension in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which spurred selling earlier in the week, was set aside as rumors spread that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> might enter the market, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had been expected to enter the market for 300,000 metric tons of sugar. Rumors are that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will buy 500,000 metric tons, <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON> said. Sugar settled .22 cent to .39 cent higher with July at 11.72 cents a pound. Cotton futures continued their run up on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as new buyers entered the market, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` What spurred the buying was the overselling in reaction to the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. `` Equilibrium has been recovered.'' Cotton settled .37 cent to 1.02 cents higher with July at 64.18 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Prime, MAI At Odds Over Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hostile suitor for <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the computer maker showed no interest in a merger during a meeting, but Prime termed the charge `` a gross misrepresentation.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, accused Prime of refusing to provide confidential information it has given other prospective bidders during a meeting over their prolonged and contentious takeover battle. He said in a statement that Prime's representatives `` evidenced no interest in negotiating a business combination of Prime and MAI at this time on the terms of MAI's current tender offer.'' Prime responded by saying it was `` shocked at the gross misrepresentation'' of the meeting by <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based MAI last November launched a hostile takeover bid for the Natick-based minicomputer maker. Its latest offer is worth about $ 1.05 billion. Prime confirmed that its chairman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, and two board members met with <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weksel </PERSON>, on Wednesday. `` We went into the meeting in good faith, without lawyers or other advisers attending, totally willing to enter into meaningful discussions, as we are with any qualified buyer,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, Prime's chief executive. `` To have <PERSON> MAI </PERSON> represent us as ` showing no interest in negotiating' is simply a gross misstatement,'' he said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> also said Prime's representatives gave <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> the same projections of earnings, income and costs that have been supplied to other potential bidders. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> cut its tender offer for Prime's stock from $ 20 cash per share to a mixture of cash and securities valued by most Wall Street analysts at $ 17 to $ 19 a share, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willman </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Sanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The original, all-cash offer amounted to about $ 970 million for Prime's outstanding shares, or $ 1.25 billion for all of its stock, including shares that can be converted from bonds. The new offer is worth about $ 1.05 billion for all of the stock, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Prime has said that if it does not receive a better offer before its annual meeting, it will enter into negotiations with <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> to explore a merger. MAI has filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to try to compel Prime to hold the annual meeting June 14, as previously scheduled. Prime announced this week it was rescheduling the meeting to July 26. A hearing on the suit is set for next week. Wednesday's meeting took place at <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>'s request. A Prime spokeswoman said it was the first meeting between <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> and top Prime executives since last fall, when <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> met with former Prime chief executive <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> shortly before launching the hostile bid.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing its exclusive soft drink contract with <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and has asked <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for a counter proposal, a company spokeswoman said Thursday. `` It's part of a normal vendor review,'' said <PERSON> Cori </PERSON> <PERSON> Zywotow </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Miami-based Burger King, the world's second-biggest fast food chain after McDonald's. `` We asked both <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> to submit proposals.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> has held the account since 1983, the year <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> lost it, and expressed confidence that it would continue providing the soft drinks on Burger King's menu. `` We've got a good record with <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and with the franchises,'' said <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Somers </LOCATION>, N.Y. The principals wo n't say, but industry experts believe Burger King sales accounted for 2.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s total soft-drink volume and 13.6 percent of its fountain volume last year. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said his company had no comment on the proposal request. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said the review was expected in light of the new corporate ownership of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the new management team at Burger King. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s parent company, was bought out by <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> last winter.

<HEAD>High-Tech Companies Need To Form Consortia, Lawmaker Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high-technology manufacturers are facing unprecedented attacks from abroad, Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said Thursday in calling for business-government consortia to re-establish American world competitiveness. `` As a result of foreign strategies successfully targeting the key technologies and industries of the 1990s, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial lead is today threatened for the first time since <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> invented the modern assembly line,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. The committee is exploring government-supported research and manufacturing consortia that could help boost fledgling industries such as high-definition television. `` American companies can not compete individually against this foreign targeting and will be increasingly forced to form consortia as well as other cooperative ventures in order to regain technological and industrial parity,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. Once American companies have led in creating such consortia and pledged `` significant resources to these consortia, various forms of government assistance will often be necessary in order for the consortia to succeed,'' he added. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics industry, which was severely buffeted by foreign competition in the 1960s and 1970s, is seeking a billion-dollar program to help launch high-definition television, which promises snapshot-sharp images with a number of medical, educational, military and entertainment applications. HDTV could revitalize the ailing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor industry as well. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> is expected to propose to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this summer a program of tax incentives and antitrust exemptions that would allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to join in <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> manufacturing consortia. But <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> has said these companies should not expect handouts from `` Uncle Sugar.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Export Task Force, took exception to the `` Uncle Sugar'' characterization. He said `` high-tech consortia are being proposed by the most successful of our companies and industries. ... If the electronics and other high tech industries seek government support today, it is not because they need a handout, but because foreign targeting has left them with no choice.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the focus of the panel was to go beyond HDTV and semiconductors to `` broader, longterm policy issues'' that would help foster a stronger economy and improved competitive position Those concerns including whether foreign companies should be allowed into consortia receiving federal support and the proper role for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in promoting commercial revitalization. <ORGANIZATION> DARPA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> told the panel that his agency already has a 30-year track record of successful government-industry research and development programs and that <ORGANIZATION> DARPA </ORGANIZATION> now was supporting 300 companies. He said R & amp; D is getting so expensive that few companies have the resources to go it alone. He said consortia can combine diverse skills and talents and save money by eliminating duplication of effort. The question of how much foreign involvement should be allowed was a tough problem to solve, Fields said, given the complex nature of today's multinational corporations. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does support foreign firms in programs with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, `` but we have not as yet significantly supported foreign firms in the development of so-called dual use technology _ technology critical for defense and also central to the civilian industrial base _ because we did not see a net gain for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomory </PERSON>, a former vice president at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the problem is not conducting effective research, which he said is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strong point, but applying that research to production, as the Japanese have done so successfully.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major supplier of lottery networks long rumored as a takeover target, said Thursday a special managment committee would evaluate merger and takeover offers. <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that `` certain parties have expressed interest in possibly acquiring'' the company, but said no offers had been received. The company said its directors were working with financial advisers Bear, <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Companies apparently, from time to time, visit <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> and raise the issue of possible business combinations,'' <PERSON> Cato </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said from his <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> added that the company was not currently in negotiations, but that it wanted a committee to monitor these inquiries.

Lower earnings last fall forced <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> to lay off 10 percent of its 1,300 workers. <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, traded nationally over the counter, closed Thursday at $ 14 a share, up $ 1.25. There were 253,000 shares traded, three times the normal activity, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. The company designs, produces and installs computerized lottery networks, with 32 customers on five continents, including many of this country's state lotteries.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> presented a contract proposal Thursday to the striking pilots union that seeks temporary pay and vacation reductions similar to those implemented for non-union workers last week. The proposal was made at the second official negotiating session since Eastern was hit by a crippling strike March 4. The concessions are necessary to help the airline emerge from bankruptcy, the company said at a news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> responded by describing the news conference as a `` public relations hoax'' and said the contract proposal `` does not address the primary issues'' that led to the strike. Eastern officials said part of the latest proposal is identical to an offer first made last July. New elements include the company's request that pilots take a 10 percent pay cut for six months and a 5 percent cut during the second six months After a year, pay would be fully restored. Eastern also proposed suspending contributions to a pension fund through 1990 and canceling vacations for the rest of this year. As part of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last week announced an austerity program that includes a 20 percent pay cut for senior management and increased work hours at the same pay for non-union employees. Vacations for those workers have been canceled for the remainder of the year. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the union was angry that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> announced the proposal at a news conference before it was presented to <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> negotiators. `` Obviously the cameras are more important than the contract,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` It's nothing more than a public relations hoax presented to establish a paper trail to the doors of the bankruptcy court, where we expect Eastern will file for abrogation of our contract.'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said abrogation of the contract `` is simply an option, one that we would not even address at this time. ... Our primary thrust is to successfully negotiate a pilots' contract. A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request to have the pilots ordered back to work. The pilots union says it has been honoring the picket lines of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, while the company argued the pilots were striking to advance their own contract negotiations without going through federal mediation procedures as the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> did. The pilots' last contract expired in July 1988. Negotiations on a new agreement have been held off and on since August 1987. Eastern filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 five days after it was crippled by the strike by <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, pilots and flight attendants.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar opened higher against the Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose moderately shortly after trading began. The dollar began trading at 143.25 yen, up 0.20 yen from Thursday's 143.05-yen finish.

A trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said Japanese investors' dollar-buying incentives continued to be strong, with most trying to push the dollar up even higher `` Turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is no longer a strong dollar-buying incentive here, and the majority of market players, who have kept buying the dollar, are now sort of testing how much farther they can go,'' he said.

<HEAD>Boeing Introduces 737-500 With Little Fanfare</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday introduced its new 737-500, a high-technology jet designed to serve airlines flying shorter routes within a hub system. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said it passed up a chance to unveil the twinjet at the ongoing <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Show because the new model of the 737 series is basically a familiar design that makes use of advances already employed in other <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jets. The successor of the 737-200 twinjet will carry 108 passengers, be quieter and consume 20 percent less fuel, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozimek </PERSON>, a marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s 737 and 757 models. Industry analysts said the 737-500 helps round out the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> family and gives it a model in the 100-passenger range. `` I think what <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is really trying to do is have a product for all ends of the market,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an aerospace analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Last April, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> placed a $ 3.1 billion order with <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch plane maker, for 150 planes that carry about 100 passengers each. The 737-500 will have the same advanced engines and avionics of the 737-300 and will have a range of approximately 3,450 statute miles. The first 737-500 will be delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in March 1990, after flight testing to begin late this month, <PERSON> Ozimek </PERSON> said. Sixteen customers have placed 138 orders for the model, which costs $ 24 million to $ 28 million, depending on its interior configuration and the date of delivery. The planes will be equipped with CFM56-3 engines, which allow air to pass through them at a low velocity, reducing noise and allowing the plane to meet the limits for noise set by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, <PERSON> Ozimek </PERSON> said. The engines are produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Production of the 737-500 is running ahead of schedule despite a backlog of orders for other <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> models. The company currently has a backlog of 1,558 aircraft, which has pushed delivery dates to 1996. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> recently expanded its plant in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, where much of the 737 model is manufactured and assembled. A $ 300 million expansion has started at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> plant.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Bush Clean Air Plan Promising For Corn Growers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans to reduce auto emissions are expected to increase demand for corn-based ethanol and expand markets for other corn products, a congressman says. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said Thursday he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will place greater emphasis on alternative motor fuels, such as ethanol, as part of a clean air program the president is scheduled to announce Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that with just normal growth in gasohol use, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would need 390 million bushels of corn to meet ethanol demand in 1989. About three-quarters of the nation's ethanol is produced in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said he expects the president's proposal to increase the demand for gasohol _ a blend of 10 percent ethanol and gasoline _ and to encourage higher concentrations of ethanol _ up to the use of pure ethanol _ as a fuel for cars, buses and trucks. `` If there is a commitment at the national level to have a substantial portion of the automotive fleet in the country, or buses or trucks, being operated by alternative fuels, then there's going to be a major expansion in the use of ethanol,'' <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a long-time proponent of increasing the use of ethanol to clean auto emissions and reduce carbon monoxide and other pollutants in the air. He promised Thursday that he will unveil `` the most sweeping changes to the Clean Air Act since it was last amended 12 years ago.'' The clean air program also will focus on factory emissions and acid rain. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to deliver a speech on alternative fuels at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, Neb. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said he based his assessment on the program's content on discussions he had Wednesday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, and other White House officials. `` Our expectation is that the announcement will include substantial incentives for the use of alternative fuels, in some case the requirement for the use of alternative fuels,'' <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said. Use of ethanol as a motor fuel is touted for reducing the release into the air of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and smog. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said ethanol also is safer and easier to transport than another alternative fuel, coal-based methanol, because it is not toxic and burns with a visible flame.

The offer from <ORGANIZATION> Brian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Roseland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was revealed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a business consultant who has arranged other ESOPs, refused to comment on his offer. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s proposal values the company at $ 2 billion or $ 27 a share, $ 23 of that in cash and $ 4 in new preferred stock.

<TEXT>
 The parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday sued the federal regulators who now control the thrift, demanding the release of $ 11 million the parent says it is owed. <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, is the latest development in a dispute with federal agencies over whether the holding company will be able to stay afloat now that the thrift is under regulators' control. <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> Savings, the nation's ninth-largest thrift, with operations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, was seized March 31 by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which declared the institution unsound. <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION>, a holding company whose stock is publicly traded and which has n't any significant assets other than two <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> units in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, was n't included in the seizure of its thrifts The suit names as defendants the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>'s own seized subsidiaries. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> responded that regulators had ample reason to take over <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, and are required by law to preserve the assets of the savings & amp; loan without regard to the fate of the holding company. `` Our responsibility is to the insured deposits and to the depositors and to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Unfortunately, that means, in the case of a stock institution, the stockholders, the debtholders, they're cut out.'' The holding company missed a $ 1 million interest payment to bondholders June 1, blaming regulators' withholding of the $ 11 million. <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> has 83 branches and the sister thrift in <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, has six branches in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and 18 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.
