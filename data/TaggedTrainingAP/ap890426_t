 The governing party on Thursday forced the 1989 budget through a parliamentary committee, paving the way for Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to resign in a far-reaching political scandal. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> pledged Tuesday to resign after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passes the budget to take responsibility for the scandal, which involves influence-peddling and questionable stock dealings among senior government officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was expected to ram the budget through Parliament later Thursday. The opposition is boycotting the session, demanding new elections and that former Premier <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> be summoned to the assembly to testify about his role in the scandal. The Budget Committee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s powerful <ORGANIZATION> Lower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, took about two minutes to approve the budget There still was no clear successor to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, since many senior party leaders are linked to the scandal. Former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75, widely viewed as the top candidate for interim premier because he is untouched by the scandal, expressed reluctance again Thursday due to poor health. On Wednesday <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, secretary general of the governing party, and the two agreed to decide on a successor after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s April 29-May 6 `` Golden Week'' holidays. The normally unflappable prime minister appeared shaken following the suicide Wednesday of <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, 58, an aide since 1958 and the man who handled <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s scandal-tainted political donations. `` I strongly regret -LRB- his action -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters. `` We walked side by side for over 30 years.'' <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, who had served <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> since 1958, was found dead Wednesday in his <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> apartment. Police said he had slashed a wrist and an ankle with a razor and hanged himself after leaving notes to his wife and several other people, including <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. Police declined to reveal the notes' contents. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he had not seen <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s note, but thought it was possible the suicide was linked to the stock-profiteering and bribery scandal. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s name, not <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s, appeared on loans and share dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that are under suspicion both for political ethics and bribery. The company, an information services conglomerate, is accused of trying to buy influence with politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives. Author <PERSON> Yotaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Konaka </PERSON>, a government critic, said, `` Mr. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had used all his might to protect Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> by putting all blame on himself, and he probably made his choice -LRB- to die -RRB- after losing the object to protect when the prime minister resigned.'' <PERSON> Tetsuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Muroboshi </PERSON>, who has written books on a number of corruption scandals, said he could not the motive was responsibility for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s fall. `` I suspect Mr. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> was cornered by something _ something he could escape from only by ending his own life,'' <PERSON> Muroboshi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his resignation plan after disclosures over the weekend that <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had accepted a $ 384,000 loan from Recruit. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on April 11 that he had received more than $ 1 million in political donations from Recruit, but he did not mention the loan. He told reporters later he had not known about it. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s name also was on opposition parties' list of 154 influential people who earned handsome profits after buying bargain-price stock in a Recruit subsidiary before it was offered for public sale. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> denied personal involvement in the stock deal. Prosecutors had questioned <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> several times. Fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen _ but no politicians _ have been arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges in the case. The wide swath of Recruit's donations, loans and share transactions cut through the political leadership have made it difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to find a replacement for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s age and health _ he is a diabetic _ make most observers consider him an interim choice who would serve for a few months while the party chooses a longer-term leader. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> becomes prime minster because of the party's big majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` When the time is right, he will announce his acceptance,'' <PERSON> Keichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>, a aide to former Prime Minister <PERSON> Miki </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> called <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s acsencion `` certain'' and said his clean reputation will boost the Liberal Democrats' ailing image. <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsukuba </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` I think we need exactly that kind of person,'' <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said. `` He is apparently not involved in big money-making connections with business, and lives in a modest home.'' <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> served as acting prime minister briefly after Prime Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohira </PERSON> died in June 1980.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Wednesday night praised a growing emphasis on international cooperation in the war on drugs, and promised multinational operations against drug traffickers. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> spoke at the 20-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to adress Thursday morning as part of two-day visit to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> spoke to reporters before his address to a closed session of the conference. `` Drug trafficking operations cross many national boundries and are beyond the reach of any one nation,'' he said. The attorney general added that during his trip to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> last month, he made plans for more combined efforts against drugs. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> praised the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> adopted last December in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, and called for its early ratification by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The multilateral agreement by more than 100 drug-producing and consuming nations is an effort to establish a set of internationally recognized drug trafficking offenses as guidelines for domestic law in each country. In his speech, released before the closed session, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> praised the arrest earlier this month of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, who was thought to control much of the Mexican drug trade. `` None of us are naive enough to think that the arrest of one kingpin will dismantle any cartel,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` But the fact that we now have ` untouchables' such as <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> and -LRB- former Colombian kingpin -RRB- <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> behind bars sends powerful signals worldwide.'' All member nations of the conference have laws on the books or pending to control drug-processing chemicals, <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. Legislation signed into law last November by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requires manufacturers to keep sales records and encourages them to report suspicious purchases of precursor chemicals to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. The law drew particular praise from the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> delegation, which maintains its country has been blamed unfairly for the international drug scourge. The seventh annual conference, meeting in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time, has drawn upper-level drug enforcement officials from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in an effort to develop a hemispheric anti-drug strategy. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to participate in a simulated drug interdiction exercise and to address an opening ceremony at a high-tech center where the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will gather intelligence and coordinate the fight against drug smugglers throughout the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Three Soviet cosmonauts returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Thursday, leaving the space station Mir with no one at the helm for only the second time since it was launched more than three years ago. The descent module touched down in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> at 6:59 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Soyuz TM-7 landed about 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dzheskazgan </LOCATION> in cloudy skies with observation helicopters on hand. Launch director cosmonaut <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gzhenebekov </PERSON> told Soviet television `` a little correction'' was made, but there were no problems with the landing. Mir, considered the showpiece of the Soviet space program, is expected to remain unmanned until August in what officials called a money-saving move prompted by delays in preparing new scientific equipment for the spacecraft. The Soviet media and and candidates in recent elections complained the billions of dollars spent on space would be better applied to social services on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Officials also said the break also would give scientists a chance to review the masses of information gathered since Mir was launched in February 1986. Cosmonauts <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> spent Wednesday packing a landing module and mothballing some on-board systems, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. A new crew is scheduled for launch this summer for a six-month mission aboard the orbiting station. The new cosmonauts are to install new modules that will approximately double the station's size and equipment and `` usher in the second phase of Mir's service life,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said In September, an Afghan and a Soviet cosmonaut were forced to postpone the landing of their Soyuz TM-5 capsule in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> for a day because of equipment and crew errors. They touched down safely a day late but were running dangerously low on food and air. In December, two Soviet cosmonauts returned from the Mir after breaking the record for the longest time in space with a year-long stay. They and a French crew member stayed on board an unplanned extra three hours because the memory of a computer aboard their capsule overloaded, Soviet media reported. <PERSON> Gzhenebekov </PERSON>, however, denied that there were serious problems on those occasions on the television news broadcast.

 Tens of thousands of Chinese students, cheered by bystanders, surged through police roadblocks Thursday to press for more democracy in a march that Communist authorities had vowed to stop. Riot police fitted with helmets, shields and sticks closed 100-acre Tianamen Square, the students' destination at the center of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Truckloads of police were parked along the square, about nine miles southeast of the campus area where the march began. `` Police get out of the way, people's police belong to the people,'' the students shouted as they pressed through a barricade of about 300 police at a major intersection in northwest <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Student leaders urged youths from dozens of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities to march to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic center of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, to protest harsh government statements condemning their 11-day-old campaign for democracy. Government officials, in mass meetings Wednesday, declared the demonstrations illegal. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Communist Party Secretary <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON> told a special meeting of 10,000 city party officials, `` We must firmly stop such riots.'' However, by noon, the marchers had pushed through three police blockades set up along the route. Authorities gave way, and there were no injuries. `` It was like watching an iron bar bend'' one bystander said, describing the police retreats. When three truckloads of armed police pulled up at an intersection, it was surrounded by a crowd shouting, `` People love the people's police, the people's police love people.'' Students with arms linked sang the national anthem and shouted `` long live democracy'' as they headed down the main road from their campuses to the square. Others shouted `` down with bureaucracy, down with corruption.'' Students reported that thousands of troops had massed near the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> along the student route toward the center of the city. `` I already know that I might die today. I am prepared,'' said one student. Thousands of bystanders along the street shouted `` Get out of the way!'' and `` Do n't beat them!'' when police temporarily blocked the students at one intersection. Along the route, thousands of people leaned out windows and applauded the students. Doctors and patients in bathrobes from a local hospital grabbed for pamphlets the students were handing out. A Chinese journalist speaking on condition of anonymity said the government moves against the protest were made by order of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to stop the students' campaign against official corruption and for sweeping democratic reforms such as a free press. `` The peasants support us, the workers support us, the army supports us, so why should we be bothered by students?'' the journalist quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as saying Tuesday. The journalist, from the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, spoke on condition of anonmyity. Spurred by the April 15 death of ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a reformer, tens of thousands of students marched repeatedly to Tiananmen Square last week. They held unprecedented sit-ins outside government and party headquarters in the largest student protest in four decades of Communist rule. More than 70,000 students from 41 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> schools began a class boycott Monday. They have demanded that 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> step down, and they want Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to open a dialogue with them. Loudspeakers at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> appealed to the students Thursday, `` We urge you to think what kind of problems will arise if you leave the university. Think what kind of effect this will have on your family and parents.'' But the students have won widespread support from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents, who have donated more than $ 8,000 to their campaign. Huge crowds have flocked to read the students' posters, and many people have expressed agreement in unprecedented street-side political debates. In front of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, one middle-aged man told several dozen listeners Wednesday he had canceled his newspaper subscriptions. `` There's no point reading them, all the papers are the same,'' he said. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> officials announced they had dismissed the editor of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s weekly <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most outspoken newspaper, and would reorganize it.

 A second day of bad weather prevented the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> from bringing two Soviet defectors to the mainland from <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diomede </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a Guard spokesman said Tuesday. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> said that when weather permits, a Guard helicopter will fly the men from the island in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. From there they will be flown to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to file formal requests for political asylum. The two sought asylum just hours before officials signed a protocol aimed at easing travel restrictions between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. Their applications will be forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for review and a recommendation, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The final decision rests with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The process usually takes several weeks, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Soviet officials are aware of the defections, but `` at this point we have no comment,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dronov </PERSON>, a Soviet vice consul based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> declined to identify the men or provide additional information about them. But sources on the island, who asked not to be identified, said the men were apprentice journalists from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in their mid-30s. They are staying at the local Guard armory. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said they were the first Soviet defectors in his 10 years with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The men were reported missing when the Soviet delegation prepared to leave the island by helicopter after a party following the signing ceremony. Other National Guardsmen helped the Soviets search for the two, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official who had reached the island before the weather turned bad. <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> said the guardsmen apparently either did n't know about the defections or felt it was n't proper protocol to inform their Soviet guests. Adj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said the timing of the defections was embarrassing. `` The governor is trying to get along better with the Soviets and here comes a couple of people who are basically messing up the operation,'' said <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, `` All of us would have liked to say, ` Sorry guys, let's try next week.''' <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON>, still weathered in on the island, said the defectors are being kept under tight security. `` Everything is hush, hush,'' he said. `` They've even got the armory windows blacked out with ponchos or something.''

<TEXT>
 No superheroes grace the pages of <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON>'s comic books, no archvillains with maniacal plots to control the world, and not a single `` Pow!'' `` Zap!'' or `` Bam!'' Even so, the black-and-white adventures of `` Felipe'' and his friends as they try to conquer a mountain of bureaucratic obstacles to become legal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents may be the most dog-eared literature in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Distributed free at employment offices, churches and social service agencies, the booklets are lessons in applying for residency under the complex 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, better known as the amnesty program. `` Amnistia'' or `` Amnesty,'' about applying for temporary residency, was out of print soon after the release of 50,000 copies a year ago. `` The Second Phase,'' about permanent residency and avoiding disqualification, is in its second printing four months after distribution of the first 30,000 copies. `` We've never had this kind of response with any material before,'' said <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfarb </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which produced the books. The potential audience in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> exceeds 1.58 million, the number of applicants for residency status under the amnesty program. `` All this subject matter is deadly boring if you are n't affected by it If you are affected by it, it's not deadly boring _ it's terrifyingly boring,'' said <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON>, 39, a former Mexican government economist who got the idea after he married a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen and moved from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. So Juarez lightened it up, capitalizing on the gallows humor and love of storytelling he said is the heritage of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where political cartooning has enjoyed a long tradition and soap opera-style novellas are popular. `` Lots of people say, ` Why a comic book? That's for a kid or the mentally retarded.' There's nothing comic about the situations portrayed in the comic books. Actually, it's a matter of life and death. It's going to determine where they live and work. But there's no reason to lose your sense of humor.'' When the characters discuss the difficulties of obtaining documents and witnesses' sworn statements to prove they've been in the country since Jan. 1, 1982 _ the cutoff date for amnesty applications _ <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> laments: `` Even my mother-in-law wanted to use the opportunity to get rid of me.'' The idea was so good that the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which had said it could n't afford to produce <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON>'s book, followed suit The government version also proved popular, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyborn </PERSON>, outreach coordinator with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think we have any left, actually.'' <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> writes the scripts in Spanish, then translates them for English editions. A former student of dramatic arts, he gets help with illustrations from his media-wise family _ his father works in advertising, his brother in film-making, and his sister is a television director in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He strives to write the scripts in the idioms of everyday Spanish, while accurately imparting information about the amnesty program _ a task that can be a `` nightmare'' because experts frequently disagree on the complex law. <PERSON> Goldfarb </PERSON> believes that unlike with government brochures, people hang onto the comics and read them aloud to their families, reaching illiterate people who otherwise might be misinformed or exploited by swindlers. `` They're fun to read,'' she said. `` The graphics and the conversations and the cultural aspects of it are things that people can identify with.'' `` Amnistia'' dealt with the first phase of the amnesty program, but applying for residency is just the first step. The application dealines were May 5, 1988, for aliens here since 1982 and Nov. 30 for seasonal agriculture workers who had picked perishable crops at least 90 days between May 1985 and May 1986. The second phase deals with permanent residency and problems like arrests, unemployment and welfare dependancy that can make applicants ineligible. Two more issues are in the works to address mandated AIDS tests; qualifying for government assistance including free and reduced-price school lunches and prenatal and infant medical care, and meeting requirements for a basic understanding of English, and American civics and history. If the next issue wins a state grant, <PERSON> Goldfarb </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> plans to print 70,000 copies for distribution by its 80 nonprofit member organizations in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, then make it available to other organizations throughout the state to reprint. <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> said the widespread readership is its own reward and has inspired him to try producing as his next project an analytical Spanish-English language magazine for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s rapidly growing Hispanic population.

 The dancers looked like winners as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> opened its spring season playing its strongest suit, choreography by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>. `` Mozartiana,'' from 1981, `` Episodes,'' from 1959, and `` Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,'' from 1941, all choreographed by <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>, comprised Tuesday's opening night program at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Theater. On this occasion, the modern movements in `` Episodes,'' to <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Webern </PERSON> music, had the most bite and gave the most pleasure. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexopoulos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlov </PERSON> had a duet lighted by two or sometimes one spotlight, just on them. This gave their very athletic movements, as when he faced the audience with her clinging upside down on his back, a look of mystery and futurism. We also saw modern-looking postures and moves in the duet by <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jock </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>. These young dancers gave this great performance art a new look. Miss <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, not yet a principal or soloist, was filling in for ballerina <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>. The other two couples in `` Episodes'' were <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jukka </PERSON> <PERSON> Aromaa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Calegari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Neubert </PERSON>. Peter Frame seemed to be struggling with his angular solo. The very musical <PERSON> Kyra </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> was joined by <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohlich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ib </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> in `` Mozartiana'' to open the evening. Four tiny girls from the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION>, as always, added charm to `` Mozartiana.'' The final ballet, `` Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,'' has for its leading ballerina role the same poignancy and elegance given the star of `` <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>.'' When the ballet was new, its name was `` Ballet Imperial,'' because the choreography is in the tradition of the Russian masters. <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> dropped the title and scenery in 1973. But <PERSON> Darci </PERSON> <PERSON> Kistler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> wore tiaras, which made them look regal. And <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Luders </PERSON>, a superb partner who can look like a pale prince, is perfect for a mood of quietly heroic sadness, which the music and dance sometimes dips into. Miss <PERSON> Kistler </PERSON> was substituting for <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> conducted. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moredock </PERSON> was the assertive piano soloist in the <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>. The season will run through June 25.

<HEAD>Newspaper Publishers Urged To Use Technology, Updated Ads, To Thrive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newspapers must use the latest technologies and updated advertising techniques in order to remain a competitive, thriving force in their communities, publishers have been told. Some newspapers are already following that advice with impressive results, news executives were told at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 103rd annual convention on Tuesday. These papers, for example, are using telephone recordings of up-to-the-minute sports scores and boldly colored ads in the middle of their stock listings. `` If newspapers are going to be as successful in the future as they've been in the past, we have to be much more zealous about getting close to our customers and staying there. Technology can help us do that,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, president of Miami-based <PERSON> Knight-Ridder </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> spoke to more than 500 people gathered for a morning session at the three-day meeting, which ends today. In 1967, he said, 73 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults said they read a newspaper every day, while last year, `` everyday readership hit a new low of 51 percent,'' and sank to 29 percent `` among the group that is key to our long-term future _ adults between 18 and 29.'' That decline, as well as the aging of the baby-boom generation, an increase in two-income households and growing cultural diversity, must be dealt with through technology, <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. `` Used intelligently, the telephone and the computer can let us recreate the kind of personal relationships that newspapers had with their customers 20 or 25 years ago,'' <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. He cited the Providence -LRB- <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal-Bulletin, which offers telephone recordings of soap-opera updates, publishing an access code for readers. The code is changed daily, so that those who want to use the service must read the paper to find it. More than 20,000 calls a month are recorded on the system, <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Boulder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camera </ORGANIZATION> gets more than 77,000 calls a month for recordings of sports scores and stories that come in after the paper has gone to press. The systems are relatively inexpensive, requiring little more than a personal computer, phone lines and tape recordings, <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. He said newspapers have little choice but to change with their readers. `` These -LRB- changes in readers -RRB- are threats, not to our existence but to our pricing flexibility, to our ability to finance the news coverage that our communities deserve and that we want to provide,'' <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. Other threats include a trend among advertisers toward using direct mail and other techniques to communicate directly with consumers, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennack </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Direct mail represents 14 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advertising and its growth is expected to outpace traditional media advertising, <PERSON> Bennack </PERSON> said. Newspapers must develop new strategies for capturing advertisers' dollars, such as updating their television guide sections and standardizing ad sizes used in the guides, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>, marketing vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> noted that with the spread of cable television, `` more promotion dollars are being spent by networks, stations,'' and others. Another recommendation is `` adoption of the ` island position' on the first page of agate stock listings in your financial sections,'' he said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Standen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, noted the recent introduction by <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s Oregonian newspaper of a boldly colored ad in the middle of its sports scoreboard. `` I think the long-term outlook for our business is bright,'' he said. `` But that future depends on our ability to change and make new opportunities happen.''

 Ten cars on a train hauling potentially toxic chemicals derailed Tuesday night, forcing evacuation of residents up to half a mile away, officials said.

It was not known exactly how many people were evacuated, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. Evacuees were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Milford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.

At least nine of the other cars on the train that remained on the tracks carried potentially toxic chemicals, <PERSON> Goggin </PERSON> said from the company's <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> headquarters. The chemicals were styrene monomer, a liquid used in refrigerator liners and auto interiors; vinyl chloride, a compressed gas used as an adhesive; and propylene oxide, a liquid used to make foam for seats and other products, he said. The cars were owned or leased by Dow, though the crew was employed by a rail company, <PERSON> Goggin </PERSON> said. He said he did n't know the name of the rail company.

<HEAD>Study: Minorities Vital To Future Of Newspapers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-ANPA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attracting more minority readers would enable newspapers to tap into fastest-growing segments of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population and could offset flat circulation trends, a publishers' task force says The group presented a 40-page report, titled `` Cornerstone for Growth: How Minorities Are Vital to the Future of Newspapers,'' to news executives at the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. The study recommends that newspapers pursue not only minority readers, but minority employees and advertisers as well. `` What we have done, in a very quantifiable way, is to make the case that what is right and fair is also smart business,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the task force. Daily newspaper circulation is about 63 million, barely more than the 62 million of 1970. But the task force report noted that 87 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population growth between now and the year 2000 will be among minorities, principally blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and native Americans. Further, the report concluded, more than 56 percent of workers joining the labor force between now and the year 2000 will be members of minorities. In order to attract both this advertising target audience and future employees, newspapers will have to adjust their sights to better serving minorities, the report said. `` This ... is a particularly useful tool for publishers as they continue to change their newspapers to better meet the needs of their communities,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochs </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulzberger </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to providing profiles on what some newspapers are doing to adapt to the changing demographics in their markets, the report debunks myths about minorities that researchers said have slowed growth in newspaper readership, circulation and advertising: _ Although some have suggested pursuing minority markets is futile because minorities do n't read newspapers, the report found minorities at higher income and education levels have the same readership rates as non-minorities _ about 70 percent. _ Although some argue that Spanish-speaking and Asian groups resist English-language newspapers, the report concluded their children will be among the newspaper's future readers. _ Although some argue that minorities ca n't afford to buy newspapers or advertise in them, the report found minority income levels increasing and growing faster than non-minority income. While non-minorities' disposable household income rose just 18 percent from 1980 to 1986, comparable figures show blacks' income increasing by 21 percent, <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON>' by 45 percent and Asian-Americans' by 58 percent.

 Here are excerpts from radio conversations taped March 24 after the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in the nation's worst oil spill. The exchanges timed off automatically and began 23 minutes after the ship's log indicated the tanker ran aground. The tapes were obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. 12:27 a.m. AST: Exxon Valdez Captain <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>: `` We've fetched up hard aground north of <LOCATION> Goose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. Evidently we're leaking some oil and we're going to be here for a while. 1:07 a.m. Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` This is the captain of the port, Commander <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>. Good evening. Do you have any more of an estimate as to your situation at this time?'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>: `` Ah, not at the present, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> here. A little problem here with the third mate, but we're working our way off the reef. We've, ah, the vessel has been holed and we're ascertaining right now, we're trying just to get her off the reef and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` Take it slow and easy. You know, I'm telling you the obvious, but take it slow and easy, and we're getting help out as fast as we can.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>: `` We're in pretty good shape right now, stability-wise, and, ah trying to extract her off the shoal here. You can probably see me on you radar, and, ah, once we get under way, I'll let you know, do another damage control assessment.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you do n't you know, start doing any ripping. You got a rising tide, you, another, about an hour and a half worth of tide in your favor, ah, ah, once you hit that max, I would n't recommend doing much wiggling.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>: `` Major damage has kind of been done and we kind of rock and rolled over it. We're just kind of hung up on the stern here. We're just, ah, we'll drift over it. Ah, I'll get back to you.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` Captain of the port out.'' 1:59 a.m. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` Any update, captain?'' A new, unidentified voice on the Exxon Valdez: `` We're still surveying tanks, trying to assess the damage.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, do you have capacity on board to internally transfer if you need to?'' The Valdez voice: `` Yes, we could do that.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` OK, that's, obviously you know better than I do, but that's highly recommended if, once you've determined which tanks are holed, to drop the head if you can.'' The Valdez voice: `` Yes, roger that.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` Are you still working, trying to get off?'' The Valdez: `` No, our engines are stopped right now. We're going to wait'til there's a little more water underneath us.'' 3:19 <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` Have you had a chance to detect whether or not any noticeable amount of oil has dropped out of any tanks and, if so, which tanks are they?'' A voice from the Exxon Valdez: `` Ah, the initial figure is 138,000 and the chief mate's taking another check on it right now.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` Which tank is that, or tanks?'' The same Valdez voice: `` Right now, our starboard slop tank, two starboard wing tanks, and possibly five center.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>: `` You said starboard?'' The voice: `` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> -LRB- gloomily -RRB- _ `` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> on that, and that was barrels, correct.'' The voice: `` That's correct.''

<HEAD>Bush's Ancestral Village Hopes for Presidential Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MESSING, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On the day <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took over the presidency from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a phone conversation between two innkeepers added an Old World footnote to the transition. `` Well then,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Farrell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ballyporeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> in Messing, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` I suppose it's over to you.'' And so it was. On Jan. 20, one minute before opening time, the mantle of presidential ancestral village passed from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Ballyporeen </LOCATION> to Messing, the English hamlet that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s forebears left for the New World in 1631 When it comes to the business of presidential roots, it's the pubs that seem to be first to have greatness thrust upon them. A highlight of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1984 trip to the town of his 19th-century peasant ancestors was <PERSON> O'Farrell </PERSON>'s pub, where he stopped for a drink. Now <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, owners of the Old Crown Inn, are hoping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit Messing when he comes to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> at the end of May and stop by for a pint of local brew. Tucked away in the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> countryside, one hour's train ride east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Messing is largely a bedroom community, so empty on weekdays that `` you could shoot a cannon through it and nobody would notice,'' according to <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, the innkeeper's wife. The prospect of presidential glory is n't universally welcomed. `` There are one or two people who are apprehensive of hordes of tourists arriving and of commercialization and trivialization,'' says <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, chairman of the parish council. But he doubts it will happen. Messing's `` nice old buildings would look pretty daft if they were all modernized and turned into gift stores,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, an engaging, tousle-haired man of 46 who takes Messing's presidential connection with a healthy sense of humor. With one pub, one restaurant, four streets and 250 inhabitants, the village is so small that its main street is called simply The Street. But as tourism becomes one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest industries, <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> county authorities have developed a heritage trail for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors, and Messing wants a piece of the action. `` Business-wise, it will certainly be better for us. We die a death during the week,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Although there is no <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ancestral home or family burial place in Messing, the medieval church and quaint houses offer good photo opportunities. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, is the biggest thing to happen to Messing since an earthquake in 1884 knocked down the pub. `` Presumably if he comes the whole thing will be so fantastically organized that we locals will get totally squeezed out,'' he says. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Peskett </PERSON>, the respected British genealogist who traced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s origins to Messing, says the president is directly descended from an aristocratic farmer who left for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1631. Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> likes to daydream about the president's ancestor strolling in for a drink at the very spot where she's now serving breakfast. Messing's native population has dwindled over the centuries, but it is now being replenished by affluent refugees from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 46, moved here six years ago and commutes to a senior post office job in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The Harrises, who are in their 40s, arrived in 1986 after six years in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and bought the pub. Understandably, Messing rooted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the election, and the pub served cake and champagne when he won. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> invited him to visit. Though noncommittal, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his reply that `` Messing will always have a special place in our hearts.'' In <LOCATION> Ballyporeen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Farrell </PERSON> says he had no regrets about ceding the crown. `` I felt quite good about it because President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a very successful tenure and it was good to see someone going out on a high note, especially when there's so much pessimism about these days,'' he said in a telephone interview. As for <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, he's just happy that fate has linked his village with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It's nice,'' he said, `` to see a local lad make good.''

 They come mostly from the families of intellectuals. Their parents are government officials, many of them are <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and now they want to change <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The tens of thousands of students who took to the streets in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week and began an unprecedented class boycott Monday are by no means the downtrodden of this country of 1.1 billion. They are its future scientists, writers, teachers and diplomats. And they are calling for a new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, one that is democratic, with a free press and respect for human rights. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiang </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, remembers when he first began believing something was wrong with his country. The son of a county official in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s northwest, <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, recalled that `` people were always giving us presents.'' `` There were big meals, TV sets. We never paid for anything. Last month we got a new video, now we have three,'' he said. `` I did n't think this was strange until I left home and found out that governments are n't supposed to work like that.'' It was his first summer vacation from university. `` My father wanted to welcome me home with a banquet. We went out and had a party. But we did n't pay. The hotel manager owed him a favor because my father gave him state funds to repair his building.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> asked his father why he did not pay. `` This is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' was the answer. `` This is not the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that I want to be a part of,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, expressing a belief shared by many protesters. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s classmate, a 24-year-old woman from Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, said she was brought up to respect individual rights. `` My parents are doctors and we've always had a good relationship. They let me live my life, never reading my private letters like other parents. I only wish the government would treat me the same.'' Although not a member of the 48 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the woman belongs to its <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a training ground for young communists. She said she believes participating in the protest does not conflict with the Marxism pushed by the league. `` <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> was a democrat. I do n't pretend to understand the real socialism that he wrote about, but I know this is n't it,'' she said. Like many students, the woman was unclear about what kind of government she wants in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` But I do n't see that as a problem. I know I do n't understand democracy. But my worry now is not with the future, it's with the present. We have a system that is rotten.'' Indeed, compared to the pro-democracy protests of 1986-87, student demands _ a free press, more funds for education and publication of the financial records of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership _ are relatively clear Still, most students expect the protests to fail. They choose to view their movement in a romantic light, as a glorious but inevitably futile cause. `` When the time comes they will crush us,'' said one young man as he gazed at thousands of Chinese soldiers during a demonstration last week. `` I'm not afraid, but they will crush us just the same.'' Students said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s increasing openness to the West and the large number of books translated into Chinese also helped spark their discontent. Several students cited the 1957 book, `` The New Class,'' in which former <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> official <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON> charged communism has produced a new class of privileged leaders instead of a classless society. `` It was an enlightenment for me because it comes from a socialist country and from a top leader there, too,'' said a 20-year-old sophomore studying psychology. Many students said they looked up to leaders of Western democracies. `` I read in the paper that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, admitted he had been a drinker and a bit of a playboy,'' said one student. `` That to me is a wonderful thing. None of our leaders would ever do that. They lack honesty and guts.'' Wu Xi, one of the few demonstrators from a peasant background, said it was not until he took a trip back home after two years at university that he made up his mind to try and change <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I remember when I was in high school. We were taught to love <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, and really we did love him,'' he said of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 84-year-old leader who instituted 1978 agricultural reforms returning land to peasants `` But this time when I went home my family could barely feed me. If this is not <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s fault, then I do n't know who to blame.'' Many students openly look down on their countrymen, expressing impatience with their unwillingness to provide more than some material and spiritual help to the demonstrators. But they also doubt themselves. `` The Chinese people are numb. They are asleep,'' said one student. `` But I do n't know if we can wake them.''

 Student demonstrators in the past week have shouted what few <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> have dared to whisper _ that senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is losing the support of the people. In posters, speeches and chanted slogans, students are proclaiming that the savior of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is too old and too autocratic and should cede power. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who turns 85 in August, is still believed to be widely admired among the populace for his decade-long program of market-oriented reforms. But many people are angered by his government's failure to halt inflation and end rampant corruption. Rising public discontent was manifested when bands of youths, many unemployed, burned and looted buildings in riots that followed student rallies in two <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. During widespread pro-democracy demonstrations two years ago, students praised <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s reforms, which brought relative prosperity to millions of Chinese. One banner affectionately read, `` Comrade <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, how are you?'' This time, posters appeared reading `` <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, your time has come,'' urging the old revolutionary to retire. One poster compared him to <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsi </PERSON>, the autocratic empress dowager who ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from behind the scenes as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last imperial dynasty crumbled. Some participants in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> demonstrations last week smashed soda bottles on the ground in a symbolic act of disdain for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. The Chinese word for small bottle sounds the same as <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s name, `` Xiaoping.'' `` <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is a great reformer, but he's a dictator and dictatorship's time is done,'' said <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, a student leader at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` We are disappointed in <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student. `` Now we think he has made many mistakes. He is trying to control power to the point of autocracy, even though he is retired in name.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has sought to avoid the turmoil of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s final years, when factions fought for power while the mentally and physically enfeebled Chairman lay dying. In 1987, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> stepped down from all his posts except the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But he is still <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s undisputed leader, the man the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the government turn to when tough decisions must be made. Although Western diplomats who attended meetings with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> recently insist he remains mentally sharp, rumors persist he is losing his grasp. `` A lot of people hope <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> will die,'' said one student. `` He is old, maybe he is crazy.'' General outrage over corruption and nepotism among <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership has also not spared <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> One poster referred to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s son, who has been linked to shady business deals as head of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Welfare Fund for the Disabled, as `` Prince'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Pufang </PERSON> Intellectual disenchantment with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> heightened after the student demonstrations two years ago, when he allowed, or perhaps instigated a numbing political campaign against Western liberal thought. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> also oversaw the ouster of his chosen successor, the reformist party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death on April 15 that touched off the current demonstrations. Intellectuals also chafe at <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s policy of pushing economic liberalization without tackling democratic reforms. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has said political reform _ meaning mainly a reduction in the party's role in government and business _ will take a decade, and it will be at least 20 to 30 years before national elections are possible. For most of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1.1 billion people, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is the man who emerged from the ultraleftist chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution to restore family farms, encourage private initiative and open <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the outside world. But in the past year the economy has been staggered by 30 percent inflation, severe shortages of materials and energy, panic buying and pandemic corruption. Even the peasants, among the first to benefit when <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> moved quickly to break up the communes, are unhappy about soaring prices for fertilizer and feed and low prices for grain the state forces them to grow. `` I remember when I was in high school, we were taught to love <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. And we really did love him,'' said one student from the countryside. `` But this time when I went home my family could barely feed me. If this is not <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s fault, then I do n't know who to blame.''

 A college student described as obsessed with war games and sadomasochistic sex was convicted of murder Tuesday in the 1987 Rambo-style slayings of two men who broke up an outdoor party he was attending. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, who could receive the death penalty, stared impassively as the verdict by a panel of three <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges was announced after two days of deliberations. Judges <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> convicted <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, 25, of capital felony, two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit capital murder in the July 11, 1987 slayings of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 25. The judges tentatively set sentencing for June 6. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, said he would apppeal. He also said he would file a motion to dispense with the penalty phase of the trial on grounds that the state's death penalty statute is unconstitutionally vague. The bearded, heavyset <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> is the great-grandson of the late <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, founder of the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, Mass.-based <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>'s chain of department stores <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> and Price broke up a party on a cul-de-sac near the home <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>'s family had just moved into, authorities said. One of them allegedly poked <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> in the nose with an iron bar. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, who was among the revelers, left the party, and went to his home, where he picked up two guns, and put on camouflage clothing and a black knit ski mask. He returned to <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>'s home with two friends and shot <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> and Price to death with a 9mm automatic pistol, firing at least 19 armor-piercing bullets at the victims. During the four-month trial, <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> was described as being obsessed with guns, war games and sadomasochism. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> shot the two men, but argued his client suffered from mental disease. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> chose to have his case decided by the judges rather than a jury.

 The wife of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says she was reluctant to leave her homeland when her husband was deposed in 1979, and offered to stay behind as a symbol of hope for his supporters. `` I said to my husband, ` If you think you should go because it would calm things, then let me stay.' Not that I would have interfered politically, but if I had stayed, people would have seen his representative, and it might have given hope to our supporters,'' said deposed Empress <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> <PERSON> Diba </PERSON> in an interview in the June-July issue of Memories magazine. <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> said she's not sure the Islamic revolution that forced her husband from his Peacock Throne could have been avoided. `` Progress caused so any changes and brought with it so many problems,'' she said. `` We were trying, in one generation, to jump from feudal and semi-feudal conditions to the 20th century and beyond.'' She said if Iranians had known what his successor, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and his followers would be like, she's certain there would not have been a revolution. <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> has homes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The first newspaper account of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s inauguration failed to sell at a <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction Tuesday timed to coincide with the bicentennial celebration surrounding <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s swearing-in. The May 2, 1789 issue of the Gazette was the `` solitary disappointment'' of the sale, which otherwise brought in $ 1.4 million _ more than twice the pre-sale expectations, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said in a statement. The top item was an 1855 letter from <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> about his <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeat, which sold for $ 77,000 to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> dealer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. It was expected to bring at least $ 25,000. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> also bought an autograph letter of <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> concerning a `` true history'' of his life for $ 20,900. Its pre-sale estimate was between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000. All prices include <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s 10 percent commission. The Gazette account of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s April 25, 1789 inauguration in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> was expected to bring at least $ 10,000, but bidding stopped at $ 4,500 and the item was pulled. `` The market for early American newspapers at auction is not a large one,'' said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s printed book expert, <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiffer </PERSON>. Among the other Washington-related items, a 12-page excerpt from the diary of the man who served as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s secretary from 1786 to 1793 sold for $ 9,350, less than its pre-sale estimate of at least $ 15,000. It provides, among other entries, a version of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s memories of <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>'s treason in 1780 Two <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> letters also were sold: a 1780 letter to Gen. <PERSON> Nathanael </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> commending his Revolutionary War service and a 1796 letter to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Both letters had pre-sale estimates of at least $ 9,000. The Greene letter sold for $ 23,100 to <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON>, a California-based dealer.

 He weighs a half-ton, squeals a lot and tries to bite the hands that feed him because his eyesight is poor. But that has n't stopped 300 people statewide from offering a home to Grunt the abandoned pig, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> animal control officials said Tuesday. `` We've had everything from a guy in <LOCATION> Lomita </LOCATION> who lived in an apartment and thought the pig would be a cute pet to a man in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with a 400-acre pig farm who wants to use the pig as a stud.

Grunt has been at the department's shelter here the past week, since he was taken from affluent <LOCATION> Rolling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estates </LOCATION>, where his owners abandoned him because they were moving.

<HEAD>Cheating Beats Embargo, But South African Arms Growth Falls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The 25-year-old arms embargo against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been beaten by cheating, smuggling and legal loopholes but still has stunted the growth of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s military, a book published today asserts The study by <PERSON> Signe </PERSON> <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> says that although the South African arms industry claims to be self-sufficient, it `` owes its existence to foreign technology,'' most of it acquired legally. `` Arms and, increasingly, production know-how, have continued to reach <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, coming from the very Western countries that agreed in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to abide by the arms embargo restrictions,'' <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> says in the book `` Embargo Disimplemented.'' The book lists the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> as having been among the most helpful. <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> said that no matter how inefficient, the embargo remains one of the few military sanctions that can be imposed on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and is valuable as a statement condemning the country's apartheid system of racial segregation. In the latest example of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s cloak-and-dagger acquisitions, French police arrested three members of a <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> militia and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessman on Saturday. Police said the four were delivering stolen parts of a British-made Blowpipe missile launcher to a South African diplomat. British news reports said the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Armscor </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Armaments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, apparently supplied small arms or cash to <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists in exchange for blueprints of sophisticated British weaponry. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> imposed a voluntary arms embargo on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Aug. 7, 1963 and made it mandatory in 1977. Sanctions were tightened in 1984 with a resolution discouraging countries from buying South African-produced weapons. The ban often was ineffective and had the countereffect of spurring the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to build up their own arms industry, the study said. But it also deprived <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> of updated weapons systems, restricted its access to new technologies and curtailed the supply of spare parts. The embargo `` has been a limiting factor to some extent in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s efforts to expand its military strength,'' says the study, citing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional testimony. The study also quotes a 1985 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report that says buying smuggled or black market weapons added 20 to 100 percent to the country's arms procurement costs. Smuggling operations are hidden by creating dummy companies, using phony labeling, diverting shipments to new destinations at sea or in midflight, and forging end-user certificates, it says. The embargo also is circumvented legally by importing civilian products which have military applications, such as electronics and telecommunications gear, the study says. Nuclear technology was one area where the embargo failed to stop South African advances, it says. It reports that by the time the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ordered a halt to nuclear cooperation in 1977, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had acquired weapons-grade expertise to go with its vast uranium resources, the world's second largest reserves. `` Its possession of nuclear weapons remains an open question, but its capacity to produce such weapons is equal to that of almost any industrial nation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the book says. Unlike Western restrictions on technology transfers to the Soviet bloc, no multinational organization exists to monitor the embargo against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and there is no list of banned goods to guide enforcement, <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> wrote. The 16-nation, Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multinational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> _ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> _ set up in 1948, has a 300,000-item list of military contraband, which could be applied against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s arms production capability was acquired through licensing agreements and by buying stakes in arms-making multinational companies, the study says. In 1963, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it had 120 foreign licenses. Before the embargo became obligatory 14 years later, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> gained licenses to produce weapons systems like the French Mirage jetfighter, the Israeli <PERSON> Reshef </PERSON> gunboat and the Scorpion sea missile, also Israeli. Equipped with the technology, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> could continue production after the franchises were withdrawn. One classic case of a clandestine acquisition was the G-5 artillery piece, based on howitzers obtained from the U.S.-owned <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the Belgian Poudreries Reunis de Belgique. The G-5 deal involved contacts through a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent and Israeli intermediaries. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> bought a Dutch-based firm and created dummy companies in <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The first shells were bought from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, bound for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and redirected to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Production lathes for the guns came from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and the shell fillings were imported from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The G-5 technology was later re-exported to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, have obtained six surface-to-surface missiles from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> capable of hitting the Syrian capital of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sources report. But the Christians, besieged in their coastal enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, are not likely to use the Soviet-designed, Frog-7 missiles except as a last resort lest they bring down the full weight of the Syrians' formidable firepower. The Christians, led by army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, have been battling the Syrians and their Moslem allies since March 8. No independent confirmation could be obtained that the Christians acquired the missiles. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival, is known to have provided the Christians with T-54 tanks, multibarreled rocket launchers, armored personnel carriers and other weapons in hope of bogging <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> down in the Lebanese quagmire. The Christians and their foes have been fighting it out with heavy artillery, rockets and giant mortars, wreaking widespread destruction on both sides. More than 100,000 shells have rained on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its environs at what military experts estimate is a cost of $ 70 million in expended ammunition. Hundreds of buildings have been hit and, by police count, more than 270 people killed and nearly 1,000 wounded. Despite Arab League peace efforts, the carnage shows no sign of ending. The Frog missiles carry warheads containing 1,210 pounds of high explosive and have a range of 43 miles. That's enough to reach <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> if the missiles were fired from mobile launchers in the mountains that form the Christian enclave's eastern flank. A high-ranking Christian officer in the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army conceded that six missiles `` are not a serious number'' and that the Frog-7s `` can hardly affect the military balance except for a momentary transfer of the battle to the Syrian capital.'' A senior source in the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces noted, `` We would use the <ORGANIZATION> Frogs </ORGANIZATION> only when we're completely cornered, because <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s retaliation will be one of total obliteration.'' Both men spoke on condition of anonymity. The Syrians have about 40,000 troops based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, mainly Moslem sectors, under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Military experts in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> say that totals 15 percent of Syrian military strength and 10 percent of its firepower. They estimate that the Syrians have used just 60 percent of their firepower in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> against the Christians and have not used their large air force. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> possibly fears aerial clashes with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which patrols Lebanese airspace at will and conducts retaliatory raids on targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after attacks against Israeli targets. `` If the Syrians really wanted to pulverize the Christians, they could do it,'' one Western military analyst noted. `` So far, they have chosen not to. But what they have deployed can wear the Christians down through attrition.'' A Lebanese army officer commented, `` Some of the howitzers used were designed to demolish bunkers and knock out runways.'' He referred to the Soviet-made, S-23 180mm howitzer with a range of 26 miles and firing a 187-pound shell. The M-1952 240mm Soviet-designed mortars used by the Syrians is one of the more destructive weapons being employed. One 220-pound shell pierced the residence of Spanish Ambassador <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristegui </PERSON> this month, killing him and several family members. Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, a veteran army explosives officer in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14 years of civil war, said: `` The shell penetrated two stone ceilings leaving a one-meter diameter hole in each before exploding in the dining room where the family was sitting.'' Ordnance experts believe the shell was probably fired from Syrian positions in <LOCATION> Schweifat </LOCATION>, two miles south of the ambassador's residence The Christians probably fear the Syrians' BM-21 `` Stalin Organs'' the most. These mobile rocket launchers can spew out 40 122mm rockets in 20 seconds, enough to blast a whole city block with high explosives. `` It's like hell breaking loose on doomsday,'' said <PERSON> Zeina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweidan </PERSON>, a 23-year old interior designer, whose home in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> district of Sin el-Fil was bracketed by a BM-21 salvo recently.

 The gaping hole in <PERSON> Gayane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasparian </PERSON>'s skull is healed and the 12-year-old girl was eager to return to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. But doctors say she faces an uncertain future in her earthquake-shattered homeland. She and 9-year-old <PERSON> Artjom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasparian </PERSON>, who is also heading home today after medical teatment here, probably will end up living in makeshift housing, possibly even tents, doctors said. `` It's hard,'' Dr. <PERSON> Nishan </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goudsouzian </PERSON> said. `` They do n't know what's waiting for them at the end of the line.'' They are among 14 children returning to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today, two months after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doctors brought them from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> for treatment of injuries they suffered in December's devastating earthquake. They leave behind 23 other children who require additional care. The children, ages 9 to 14, were brought to hospitals in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> by Project Hope, after a team of doctors who visited victims of the earthquake selected them for advanced care. A day before her scheduled departure, <PERSON> Gayane </PERSON> danced in the lobby of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> shouting `` <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>!'' In February, <PERSON> Gayane </PERSON> had a large hole in her skull with just a thin patch of skin protecting part of her brain. Doctors grafted skull from the back of her head onto her forehead. <PERSON> Artjom </PERSON>, who is not related to Gayane, arrived at <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> General with two badly crushed legs. The boy's grandmother, who shielded him while he was buried underneath rubble for four days, died from her injuries. `` In the beginning when they told me to stand up, I was scared, I had no muscles,'' said <PERSON> Artjom </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter. `` But now I can stand up.'' <PERSON> Artjom </PERSON> walked into a room at the hospital barely using one crutch. Doctors said he would have to learn to walk again because of a lack of wheelchair facilities in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Gayane, <PERSON> Artjom </PERSON> and their mothers stayed in Armenian-American homes in nearby <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION> during their treatment. They attended an Armenian school where Gayane learned the English alphabet, doctors said. Gayane still needs plastic surgery to reconstruct three missing fingers on her right hand. She hopes to return to this country for the surgery but for now is looking forward to returning home, doctors said. Goudsouzian, chief of pediatric anesthesiology, said <PERSON> Gayane </PERSON> spent hours kissing pictures of a brother who died in the quake, which killed more than 25,000 people and left many thousands homeless. The returning children will be treated at a new outpatient clinic established in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, to track the quake victims.

 He was an architect and a hospital porter, an aeronautical engineer and a sculptor, a decorated soldier and a monastery gardener. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> also was one of the century's greatest philosophers, and today, on the centennial of his birth, his memory is being celebrated at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he was professor of philosophy. <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> conferences are taking place in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and other countries, while in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> became a naturalized subject in 1938, the highlight is today's concert at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. `` We will have some <PERSON> Bruckner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>, and also something by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Labor </PERSON>, an obscure composer, but <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> liked him,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Denyer </PERSON>, a teaching fellow in philosophy at <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON>'s complex theories of language, thought patterns and logic led to the conclusion that everything that mattered most could not be put into words. `` He is regarded as difficult to understand,'' says <PERSON> Denyer </PERSON>. `` His ideas are of such interest that they have attracted more commentaries and expository works than most 20th-century philosophers. He remains a controversial figure, and a lot of issues he opened up in his later work are still being explored.'' <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on April 26, 1889, and spent his last 22 years at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. Three of his four brothers committed suicide, and he lived on the edge of madness and suicide until cancer killed him in 1951, at age 62. `` He was extraordinary,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, a film producer who explored <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON>'s life in a film broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> last week. `` He was a pretty good architect, an aeronautical engineer who invented a jet system not long after the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brothers first flew, a logician and philosopher of amazing talent, a fearless and multidecorated soldier in World War I, a village schoolmaster, a monastery gardener's assistant, a sculptor, hospital porter in World War II and <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> professor,'' <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> said in an interview. `` People who knew <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> described him as good looking, striking, not very tall, with deep hyacinth-blue eyes, of military bearing, aristocratic,'' he said. Most of <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON>'s only book published during his lifetime, `` Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,'' was written under fire on the eastern front and completed in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp. It proposed the idea of a logically perfect or ideal language, the prototype of which he saw in mathematical logic. Seven other works were published after his death. His mentor, the British philosopher <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, said that when he read the first sentence a Wittgenstein essay, `` I became persuaded that he was a man of genius.'' <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> was not really at home in the 20th century. `` <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> never married,'' said <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>. `` He liked solitude, in a log cabin he built in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, in a hut in <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION> on the west coast of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and on the <LOCATION> Gower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>.'' `` He liked detective stories and the cinema, especially Westerns. He always sat in the front row so there would be nothing in his field of vision except the screen, to try to free his mind of the philosophical questions that troubled him.''

 The elderly are inadequately protected from medical insurance frauds, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said today while vowing to introduce legislation that would tighten enforcement. `` There will always be scammers and schemers, but we need n't make their job so easy,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> declared in a statement kicking off a hearing of the oversight and investigations subcommittee he also heads `` Taking advantage of old people is easy,'' he said. `` It is also reprehensible. It must stop.'' The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat _ who called state insurance regulators, prosecutors, and members of elderly advocacy groups before the panel _ acknowledged that insurance regulation can be highly technical. `` But when regulations are policies are writen in terms that only a select few can understand, the public has been hoodwinked,'' he said. `` No amount of legalistic babble can obfuscate the fact that elderly people are being skinned and that the law is not protecting them.'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> released the results of a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study of the amount of claims paid out by hospital indemnity policies compared with the amount of premiums collected. Using 1987 statistics, it showed an average loss ratio of 52.7 for 37 policies _ meaning the companies paid out nearly 53 cents of every dollar collected in premiums. He had released another <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study two weeks ago that showed only marginally better payouts for Medigap policies sold to supplement coverage under the giant <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> health program for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 33 million elderly and disabled. While Medigap plans cover such things as the one-day hospital deductible not paid by Medicare, indemnity policies are those that pay the beneficiary a certain amount of cash for each day hospitalized. `` Simply put, hospital indemnity plans are not really medical insurance, just a bad gamble for older persons,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Firman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seniors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee in testimony submitted in advance. `` Hospital indemnity plans have always been a bad deal for older persons,'' said <PERSON> Firman </PERSON>. `` Now, with improved hospital coverage under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, hospital indemnity plans do not cover any significant risk faced by most older persons.'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee the association has already revised the minimum standards required by Medigap policies to take into account the expanded coverage under the expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> last summer to include catastrophic illness care. However, <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON> said, the restructuring of the private policies has not meant a corresponding decrease in premiums for the private policies purchased by more than two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries. `` Several factors have wiped out any refunds or credits and in fact are contributing to net increases in the premiums on the existing business,'' said <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON>. `` The factors ... are the length of time since the last premium increase, recent loss ratio performance, increase in utilization and in price of medical services and addition of new benefits to the policies.''

 House Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> says he does n't feel snared by his own trap, despite similarities between the ethics complaint against him and the charges he instigated against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` I knew full well that this issue might well come up when I filed charges against <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Tuesday, referring to the complaint Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., filed against him with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee `` I knew full well the intensity and savagery of the Democratic response.'' The complaint, filed earlier this month, alleges 10 violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in a partnership set up in 1984 to promote sales of `` Window of Opportunity,'' a book co-authored by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, and political associate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. Many of the investors in the partnership were Republican political activists who later obtained tax writeoffs from the arrangement. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and his wife, who was the general partner of <ORGANIZATION> COS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, released hundreds of pages of documents Tuesday and then appeared together at a news conference in an effort to lay to rest the charges outlined in <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint. But the news conference turned stormy as reporters persisted with questions about the parallels between the ethics problems facing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and those confronting <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, upset by the questions, walked out of the room midway through the session. `` What we did, we did legally correct, we did ethically correct, we did it out in the open and it is above board,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said, `` and I think that's a huge difference between us and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' The partnership involved 18 individuals and three corporations that put up $ 5,000 each to promote the book, in exchange for a promise of half of the publisher's profits. But the partnership reported more than $ 100,000 in losses from 1984 to 1988, and those losses were divided among the partners for tax writeoffs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> acknowledged that some of the partners had a direct interest in legislation, and his office handled routine requests for some of them. But he denied that he provided any of the partners `` unusual or extraordinary personal help'' with any problem they had with the federal government. House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more than $ 100 from persons with direct interest in legislation, but <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the $ 5,000 each investor put into the deal did not constitute a gift because each one `` thought there was a reasonable chance that it might make money.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and his wife each earned $ 7,018 in royalties on the book, under a contract that provided the three authors with a total royalty of 10 percent on hardback sales and 8 percent on paperback sales. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the arrangements surrounding his book may have been unusual, but they were not unethical. In comparison, he said, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s bulk book sales were unethical. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is charged with violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules limiting outside income by arranging bulk sales of his book to special-interest groups in lieu of speaking fees. Book sales are not covered by the income limits, while speaking fees are. `` We wrote a real book, working with a real publisher, distributed to real bookstores and sold to real people for a realistic, standard royalty,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did none of those things.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> also said that his wife's work for the partnership was more substantial than that done by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife in a business arrangement that prompted several ethics charges against the speaker. `` She actually did the work for the money she got,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said of his wife. He said the 350 pages of tax returns, incorporation papers, and financial records released Tuesday represent her work for the partnership. As general partner, she received a $ 10,000 payment in 1984 for setting up the partnership, and later received a 2 percent interest in the partnership and another $ 1,500 payment for her work.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>'s resignation as musical director forces the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION> to hunt for a new conductor at a time when other major orchestras are trying to fill vacancies. His decision to leave his $ 500,000-plus-a-year job was announced Tuesday amid reports of artistic disagreements with Music Center Executive Director <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> will continue as guest conductor with the orchestra for several more years. <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>'s resignation is the latest change to unsettle the symphonic world, which on Monday learned that 81-year-old <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> was stepping down as director of the celebrated <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic. Among the others searching is the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Symphony recently appointed <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> to replace Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>. `` I have decided that, in the current structure of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>, it has become obvious to me there is no room for a music director,'' the 60-year-old <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> told the board, according to a statement from the philharmonic Tuesday. The resignation is effective at season's end. <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, who became music director in 1986, clashed with <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> over guest conductors on recordings, how <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> edited musical works _ even cutbacks on office supplies and coffee. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> said a search for a new music director would begin immediately. It took the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> 14 months before finding a replacement for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON>. On Tuesday, the orchestra announced the appointment of Israeli conductor <PERSON> Yoav </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmi </PERSON> as music director. The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> orchestra is already searching for a conductor to replace <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, who is quitting for medical reasons. <PERSON> Zubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>, who once headed the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>, has announced his resignation from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> said he planned to conduct the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> orchestra as guest conductor for seven weeks next season and six weeks each for the 1990-91 and 1991-92 seasons. `` Because of my love for the orchestra, I am perfectly happy to continue making music with them,'' he said. He also will take up the baton for some recordings, a May 1990 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, and for the opening concert of the Carnegie Hall centennial season in September 1990. <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, an Oscar-winning composer and conductor, stepped down as the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Symphony music director for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> post. He left <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> because he reportedly was unhappy about a lack of support for his `` artistic goals.'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> had sought him for the job to replace <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Giulini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> began his composing career at <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> studios at age 16, and eventually wrote scores for more than 30 movies. He won Oscars for `` Gigi'' -LRB- 1958 -RRB-, `` Porgy and <PERSON> Bess </PERSON>,'' -LRB- 1959 -RRB-, `` <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Douce </PERSON>,'' -LRB- 1963 -RRB- and `` My Fair Lady,'' -LRB- 1964 -RRB-. He also has won seven Grammys, has recorded on several labels, and led many of the top orchestras of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during his career. During his tenure as music director, the philharmonic made 10 records, and toured <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the fall 1988. He also took the orchestra on various domestic tours.

<HEAD>US, Anti-Sandinistas Say Election Being Rigged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is joining a delegation of Nicaraguan opposition leaders in accusing Sandinista authorities of trying to rig national elections set for next February. The opposition leaders, ranging from an anti-Sandinista communist to U.S.-backed Contra rebels, said Tuesday that Nicaraguan officials are attempting to ensure victory by stacking the all-powerful <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in their favor and by denying the opposition equal access to media outlets. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> leveled similar charges and appealed to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> to meet opposition demands for a more equitable process. At issue is legislation approved by recently by the Sandinista-dominated legislature setting forth ground rules for the elections. Tuesday was the deadline, established at a Central American summit meeting last February in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, for setting in motion an electoral process that will culminate in national elections 10 months from now. <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said the new laws were approved with the participation of the political parties represented in the legislature and are in compliance with the terms of the Central American summit. In a telephone interview, she said the law allows opposition parties more air time for campaign purposes than they would have received under their original request. In addition, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, consistent with another pledge made at the summit, have released about 1,700 National Guardsmen who served the rightist regime which was ousted by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> a decade ago. Twelve opposition leaders outlined their criticisms at a news conference after discussing the issue with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> officials. The delegates included <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and three members of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the administration shares the criticisms of the opposition leaders. The electoral law approved last week `` is not the result of good faith bargaining between the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the internal opposition groups, and was unilaterally imposed after being passed by the Sandinista-dominated legislature,'' she said. She said the law includes a provision requiring that the election council which the Sandinistas control receive one-half of any foreign political contributions. The law, she said, ignores proposals made by the internal opposition for absentee balloting and procedures for ensuring unlimited access for international election observers. A new law governing press conduct, she added, includes penalties for disseminating information which the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> determines to be a violation of national integrity and allows officials to order closures of up to four days.

<HEAD>Brief Cites Drug Arrests of White House Support Staff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> brief defending the administration's plan to test more than 1,500 White House employees for drugs says two workers have been fired in the last 2 -LCB- years because of illegal drugs. `` In one case the employee, a motor vehicle operator, tested positive at a hospital for cocaine,'' says a declaration by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Easley </PERSON>, the security officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the second instance, an accounting technician was arrested for possession of cocaine outside the complex shortly after departing work.'' Both employees were fired, <PERSON> Easley </PERSON> said in his declaration, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> brief. The positions held by the two fired workers would be subject to random drug testing under a plan originally proposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House and now being pursued by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The brief was filed late Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> where 30 employees of the Executive Office of the President filed suit in January to block the random drug tests as unnecessary and unconstitutional. A hearing on the case is scheduled for May 11. There have been revelations earlier that two <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> clerks resigned and there had been two resignations and two firings in the Uniformed Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> stemming from a drug investigation that surfaced last May. But there had been no previous mention of the two employees in the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> the part of the Executive Office of the President that provides administrative support to the rest. The plan calls for random drug testing of 1,520 of the 1,850 employees in the agencies in the Executive Office of the President, including the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House announced last June 30 that everyone on its payroll would be subject to random drug tests in 60 days. But that program was held up by court challenges. The suit by the employees of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> complex is one of more than 50 suits filed by employees throughout the government to stop drug testing. `` These are extremely loyal people, loyal to the president and loyal to government administration,'' their <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liss </PERSON>, has said. `` They just think random drug testing is unconstitutional, not justified, an invasion of their privacy and demeaning.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in its brief cited two recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions _ a 7-2 ruling in favor of testing of railroad crews after accidents and a 5-4 ruling upholding a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy of testing applicants for law enforcement jobs _ in support of the plan to test the executive office employees. The department also noted that those to be tested already had willingly allowed extensive background checks in order to get their sensitive jobs, thus voluntarily limited their right to privacy. `` The test involved here detracts little from their already limited privacy rights,'' the brief says. The brief notes that the employees `` are the personal staff of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` Just about all of these employees designated for random testing have access to the president and the White House complex ... or to classified and @ or sensitive information or to both,'' it says. Their roles as advisers to the president and participants in the development of domestic and foreign policies `` make random urinalysis drug testing for such employees reasonable,'' the brief says. `` Their regular access to highly sensitive or classified information makes random drug testing a necessity.'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said March 29 that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was displeased by the employees' suit, saying the government must ensure `` a clean workplace.''

<HEAD>American in Costa Rica Said to Use Ranch for Drug, Arms Shipments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Drug planes used airstrips on the ranch of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> while the former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> resident helped a secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operation to aid the Nicaraguan Contras, witnesses told a Foreign Relations narcotics subcommittee. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee report on international drug trafficking says five witnesses identified <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> as a participant in international drug trafficking. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, whose property included airstrips, was charged in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> last January with drug trafficking and violating that nation's neutrality. The report said that in addition to his drug activities, <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> also defrauded the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of $ 375,000 when he pocketed a loan for a wood products factory that never produced anything. The report, obtained Tuesday from Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said only one of the five witnesses told the panel he personally witnessed cocaine being loaded, in <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s presence, onto planes headed for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The witness was identified as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>, a drug smuggling pilot serving a 27-year prison term for running a continuing criminal enterprise for trafficking in cocaine. Another witness, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotz </PERSON>, said he heard about drug flights to <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch from the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> pilots who allegedly flew the planes. <PERSON> Lotz </PERSON> described the strips as refueling stops, and told the subcommittee, according to the report, that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> `` was paid'' for allowing their use. <PERSON> Lotz </PERSON>, a Costa Rican, was convicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for conspiracy to import drugs in 1985 and sentenced to four years in prison. He was deported at the conclusion of his sentence to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The report also said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> and two associates applied for the <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> loan in 1983, saying they wanted to finance a `` joint venture wood products factory that would make wheelbarrow and ax handles for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. market.'' The money was advanced on March 30, 1984. By the end of 1985, after one interest payment, the loan lapsed into default, and <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> officials `` began to recognize that the project was a fraud, and that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> had made false representations in making the application to <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>,'' the report said. The agency found, according to the report, that the money was deposited in <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bank account and the funds withdrawn by <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> in cash. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> that wanted the cash to buy Costa Rican money on the black market to get a more favorable exchange rate. `` In fact, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> has a favorable exchange rate for foreign investment and the excuse <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> offered does not make sense,'' the report said. `` What appears to have happened is that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> simply took the money, inasmuch as no equipment was purchased for the factory, no products were shipped from it, and <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s partner ... testified that he never saw the money.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told the panel there's an ongoing investigation into the loan. <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> eventually tried to sell the property <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> put up for collateral, but to prevent a sale far below the market price, <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> bought its own property for $ 187,500. Later, <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> negotiated an agreement with a purchaser, who was required to make no down payment, and to repay <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> its $ 187,500 only from future proceeds of the sale of timber cut on the land. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was the focus of news reports during the unraveling of the Iran-Contra affair citing the use of his ranch as a conduit for arms to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. There were also published reports at the time that he was involved in drugs.

 A crippled <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight's crew worried about staying aloft and boosted each other's spirits during the harrowing return to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> after their plane ripped open in flight, according to a cockpit recording transcript released Tuesday. The transcript was released as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> opened a hearing into why <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811's cargo door blew off, sucking nine passengers to their deaths and knocking out two engines. Speculation has focused on the failure of a latch to work properly, although the crew at first thought the damage might have been caused by a bomb. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> released its transcript of recorded radio conversations between the airplane and the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> control tower earlier this month. The transcript of the cockpit recording released Tuesday was the first indication of what crew members said to each other during the 25-minute return to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 departed shortly before 2 a.m. HST on Feb. 24 from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, bound for <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, with 337 passengers and 18 crew. The flight was uneventful until 2:09 a.m., when pilot <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said: `` What the -LRB- expletive -RRB- was that?.'' `` I do n't know,'' replied first officer <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Slader </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Then there is the sound of a loud bang, and power to the recording unit was interrupted for 21 seconds There is the sound of an alarm horn. `` Goin' down,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Incline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, said, followed by `` Emergency descent.'' `` I think we blew a door ... or something,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> says seconds later. `` Tell the <ORGANIZATION> PA </ORGANIZATION> _ the, ah, flight attendant to get, ah, prepared for an evacuation,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said. The crew shut down the damaged No. 3 engine. Flight engineer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, began dumping fuel as the plane limped back to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. At 2:13 a.m., <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said: `` I think we might have some damage out there.'' `` We got a control problem here,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said seconds later. At 2:14, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> noted a problem with the No. 4 engine, and the crew discussed flying the massive plane on just two engines. `` Can you maintain 240 -LRB- knots -RRB-?'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> asked. `` Yeah, just barely,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> replied. `` Yeah, but we're losing altitude,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said. `` I know it,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said. At 2:16, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> offered to go into the passenger cabin to check the situation. Seconds later, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> announced no fuel flow to No. 4 engine. `` What a -LRB- expletive -RRB- of a thing to happen on your, ah, second to last month,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> told <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. `` No -LRB- expletive -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, then 59 and on his second-to-last flight, replied. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> retired 10 days later on reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60. Immediately after, <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> noted a fire on the No. 4 engine. `` Go through the procedure, shut down the engine,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said. `` We're not gon na be able to hold this altitude on two -LRB- engines -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said. At 2:17, eight minutes after the trouble began, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> returned to report the gaping hole. `` The right side is gone ... it's just open. You're just lookin outside,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` Looks like a bomb,'' he said. `` Fuselage?'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> asked. `` Yes, fuselage, it's just open,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` Some people are probably gone. I do n't know.'' After a six-second silence, the crew turned back to flying the plane. At 2:19, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> told the tower they would `` like all the medical equipment we can get.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> warned against flying too fast because of the gaping hole, and <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> wondered what the minimum airspeed was under the circumstances. `` I would n't go below 240,'' he said. `` Is there a closer airport than this?'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> asked at 2:22. At 2:24, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> announced he could n't hold altitude. `` OK do n't, OK, ah well, we have 24 miles to go and we're drifting down slowly ... `` <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> replied `` You're gon na make it,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` Make sure we do n't hit any -LRB- expletive -RRB- hills on the way,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> added. At 2:24, <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> reported seeing the lights of the airport. `` OK ... we're 21 miles out and we're in good shape,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said. At 2:25, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> began reading off the checklist for a two-engine approach. `` I hear people screaming back there,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said at 2:30. At 2:33 the plane's wheel touched the runway. At 2:34 a.m., <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> signaled the evacuation of the plane. The tape ended seconds later.

<HEAD>Star Wars Focus on Thousands of Tiny Satellites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Star Wars research is focusing on a concept called `` Brilliant Pebbles,'' consisting of thousands of satellites under three feet long and designed to knock down enemy missiles, says <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that he remains a strong advocate of <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative, but is recommending that the budget for fiscal 1990 be cut to $ 4.6 billion from the $ 5.9 billion proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` believes very deeply that we need to go forward with strategic defense.'' Much SDI research will focus on the Brilliant Pebbles concept, said <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, although SDI officials later said that weapon is one of several space-based anti-missile satellites under consideration. The budget level for Star Wars `` will buy us the capability to look aggressively at Brilliant Pebbles,'' said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` If Brilliant Pebbles does not work out, the ultimate deployment date of the current space-based missile program would slip by two years.'' He did not set a date. Plans call for the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to decide in 1993 or 1994 whether to go ahead with Star Wars, said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen. Several years later, deployment could begin on the first elements, surveillance satellites and ground-based missiles. Brilliant Pebbles drew backing from the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> SDI </ORGANIZATION> chief, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, who predicted in a Feb. 9 memorandum that it could be deployed in space for about $ 25 billion, far under estimates of $ 45 billion for other SDI orbital systems. The concept calls for between 3,000 and 5,000 satellites, about three feet long and weighing less than 100 pounds apiece, to be placed in orbit up to 400 miles above the earth, according to retired Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, a strong backer of Star Wars. Each satellite would be housed in a protective cocoon, called a `` life jacket,'' from which it would be ejected in time of war. If everything worked, sensors aboard the satellites would spot and track enemy boosters, and rockets would propel the `` pebbles'' toward the boosters, destroying them before they could release their warheads. The other space-based interceptor -LRB- SBI -RRB- under consideration calls for several hundred satellites, each armed with about a dozen interceptors, which would be fired at enemy boosters. Brilliant Pebbles and SBI rely on a Boost Surveillance and Tracking Satellite, in high earth orbit, designed to spot boosters at launch. Brilliant Pebbles is the brainchild of <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a physicist at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He is a protege of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON>, who is known as the father of the hydrogen bomb and helped persuade <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to launch his Star Wars campaign. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s remarks drew applause from SDI backers and skepticism from Star Wars critics, who note that any space-based system would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and thus lead to a new round in the arms race. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the head of the pro-Star Wars lobbying group <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` delighted'' by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s remarks. Critics noted that the Pentagon has done relatively little work so far on Brilliant Pebbles. `` The fundamental problem is that there is no ` there' there. At this point it is just a neat idea,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, director of space research for the Federation of American Scientists. `` I think it is entirely premature for the administration to be making the claim that this will pan out,'' said <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, calling <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s remarks `` a triumph of faith over fact.'' SDI is spending $ 40 million on Brilliant Pebbles this year, a tiny fraction of its overall budget and only 10 percent of the $ 400 million it is spending on two ground-based interceptors that would likely also be deployed in any anti-missile defense. The Brilliant Pebbles budget for fiscal 1990 has not been disclosed, but an <ORGANIZATION> SDI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freitag </PERSON>, said `` we certainly take our direction from the secretary of defense and the administration. Technology will also be a determining factor.'' SDI spokesmen stressed that Brilliant Pebbles was just one possible component in a system that would include layers of surveillance satellites, space-based kill vehicles and ground-based anti-missile missiles. `` It's just one element among space-based interceptors that we are looking at,'' Col. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Seelig </PERSON>, the SDI comptroller, told reporters. Brilliant Pebbles is not what SDI officials call a `` mature technology,'' on which much research has been done, said Capt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, another SDI spokesman. But `` it is probably an advanced concept that we could bring to fruition quickly'' and at a lower cost than other versions. The SDI director, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, is scheduled to appear before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next Tuesday to explain exactly how the lower budget proposal would affect SDI research through fiscal 1990.

 The Rose Garden is one of the most meticulously kept and manicured tracts of real estate anywhere, but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> views it as another chunk of `` mother earth.'' Nearing the 100-day mark in his presidency, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been making active use of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> grounds _ especially now that the weather lends itself to outdoor pursuits. `` I wish that all of you who love nature and love the earth _ mother earth _ could have been with -LRB- Agriculture Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and me as we walked through the beautiful Rose Garden area of the White House,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a radio audience. `` It is at its most beautiful this time of year. And I get a kick out of seeing all the tourists from <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and agricultural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and everyplace coming to the people's house,'' he said during a recent broadcast sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. And while the 18-acre estate hardly qualifies as the Great Outdoors, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the latest in a string of presidents and their families to enjoy the grounds since <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> first obtained funds to fence them in. <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> grazed sheep on the rolling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> during World War I. An early photograph shows <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> posing there with his grandson and a pet goat. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> rode Macaroni, her pony, on the grounds. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had a tree hut. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> played medicine ball outside with his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> pitched horseshoes _ an outdoor sport that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has revived. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sometimes refers to as a role model, established the first tennis courts. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> had an outdoor swimming pool built and swam there. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> did calisthenics on the White House lawn as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s Cabinet. <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> marked off a croquet court. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> practiced golf shots on the lawns. The Rose Garden, which sits right outside the Oval Office, has been a popular spot for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been using it extensively in recent weeks _ to honor championship basketball teams and volunteer groups and to welcome foreign dignitaries. The recently negotiated budget agreement was announced in the Rose Garden. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used it for launching his $ 441 million education package and for signing a bipartisan agreement on Contra aid. The Rose Garden was also well used by other presidents. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> `` campaigned'' for re-election from the Rose Garden in 1976. And <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used it frequently for receptions and ceremonies. The White House grounds are also the site for dog walks, now as in past presidencies. `` Think of the deficit reduction as exercise: like walking the dog every day,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> audience on Tuesday. `` Believe me, I know. Exercise keeps you at the top of your game.'' That may be so, but if truth be known, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the one who usually walks first dog Millie on the White House grounds. Ever since <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> first used the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> as a landing pad for helicopters, presidents have begun and ended trips there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is no exception. Coming home from their most recent weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, the president and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped from their helicopter and walked toward the White House. First dog <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> was on hand and bolted away from a group of greeters toward the president, who outstreched his arms. The dog zoomed right past <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and stopped lovingly at the feet of Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Another recent vignette outside the White House was also played without words. It was a crisp spring morning as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his current four-day trip across the country with a helicopter ride from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to nearby <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the way he starts all trips. First staff members, then the Bushes, boarded the helicopter, known as Marine One. He gave a wave and the doors of the craft swung shut. Its rotors began to whirl faster and faster _ and then stopped. Something was wrong. The takeoff had been delayed. The several dozen onlookers looked around expectantly. What was wrong? Then, all eyes swung to the right, where a solitary figure in a business suit was hurrying across the lawn, clutching a brief case. The red-faced official looked disbelievingly at his watch, shaking his head, huffing and puffing toward the waiting helicopter. A door swung open and a tardy chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> climbed aboard.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration pledged cooperation with the successor to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, but analysts say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next government may be too weak to deal with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on trade and other issues. Regardless of who succeeds <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, U.S.-Japanese relationships will be marked by disputes over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s $ 50 billion trade imbalance, pressures in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to contribute more to its own defense and Japanese criticism of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit. The resignation also leaves the troubled FSX fighter-plane deal hanging at least until a successor to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> takes office. `` We will continue to work closely with the new prime minister and the new government,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said upon receiving news of the resignation Monday. And <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> emphasized to reporters on Tuesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> remain strong. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> noted that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had a `` close, personal, warm friendship'' with <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` will miss his good friend,'' she said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> worked closely with <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> when they both served as their respective governments' chief financial officers. In remarks that hinted at the difficulties that may lie ahead, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., lauded <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> for his courage in helping carry out trade agreements that were viewed unfavorably at home `` The decisions to import more American beef and citrus were very deeply offensive to Japanese farmers and created a very negative political reaction in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. The congressman said he believed it may be `` extremely difficult'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to win any further trade concessions from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> until a strong government is able to come to power. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, linked to an influence-peddling scandal, has announced his resignation but his successor and the timing of his departure remain unclear. In the meantime, it appears possible an elder politician might become interim prime minister. This could create some short-term uncertainties in the relationship, analysts said. `` In the broadest sense, the effect will be of a weakened government being unable to take bold actions,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalapino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scalapino </PERSON>, who specializes in Japanese political and security issues, said the move toward a caretaker government or even one led by an elder statesman means it will be difficult for the Japanese to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for any changes in policy, be it in trade, defense or economic matters. `` A weak government ca n't support bold, new policies,'' he said. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pharr </PERSON>, director of the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, struck a similar tone. `` It sets back U.S.-Japan relations, because it could slow things down for a while,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Pharr </PERSON>, a professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not a major setback, but it's not the best situation you could hope for, either.'' Ms. <PERSON> Pharr </PERSON> said that without a strong leader in place in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the country's bureaucracy tends to exert more influence. `` It does n't help speed things along,'' she said. `` We want things to happen more quickly than they will happen,'' she said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who worked closely with Japanese economic officials during his eight years as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not believe <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation will have any lasting impact on U.S.-Japan relations. `` It is not helpful to have a Japanese government leaderless for a period of time, but I am not sure that is going to happen,'' he said. Former Japanese Ambassador <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Okawara </PERSON> predicted that the policies of the current government, which have included significant support to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in such areas as Third World debt, would be continued by the caretaker government chosen to succeed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. But he added that `` during this unstable political situation, no new initiatives can be taken.''

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkin </PERSON> could n't take a leave from his job after the death of his homosexual lover of 11 years, but a proposed law would give him and other city employees the same bereavement leave as married couples. The measure proposed Tuesday effectively would redefine the family by legally equating homosexual and unmarried relationships with marriage for 24,000 municipal employees. `` The legal world must reflect the realities that exist in our private existences,'' said Supervisor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, who wrote the `` domestic partnership'' legislation. `` Both gay people and unmarried heterosexuals have been denied the fundamental right to live in love and happiness.'' A narrower version of the legislation was vetoed by then-Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> in 1982. She called it too vague. But this time, Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> endorsed the measure from the start and eight members of the 11-seat <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> signed on as co-sponsors. The ordinance will be heard before a city committee on May 11. If approved, it would be the most far-reaching measure of its kind, although three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, allow municipal employees to add partners to health benefit and pension plans. The ordinance would ban discrimination by any city agency against people because of the non-traditional relationship status. It also requires that steps be taken to extend many benefits to people in committed relationships that now are provided only to married people, including dependent health care and legal standing in housing contracts. `` The message is that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is a place where it is understood that the family unit, even if it is non-traditional, is paramount to our lives in terms of our survival, the support we need, to keep us free from loneliness, to help us economically,'' said <PERSON> Brinkin </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully sued his former employer, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, over the denied leave. Although the ordinance would not apply to the private sector, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> announced it would begin a study of the issue with the aim of informing businesses what benefits they should offer employees in such relationships. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s measure would require domestic partners to have a joint home and to share basic living expenses, although each could maintain a second home. They also must register with City Hall or, for those wishing confidentiality, with a notarized statement filed with an independent third party, such as a private attorney. The measure has been criticized by some religious groups. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> will not support `` any effort to weaken the institution of marriage, to tinker with it, or put any parallel system alongside it,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaria </PERSON>, of the Washington-based National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, called domestic partnership a `` fundamental requirement'' for homosexuals to be accepted by society. `` This tells people that gay and lesbian relationships are a viable, healthy and acceptable new form of the traditional family,'' <PERSON> DiMaria </PERSON> said. The measure directs a city task force to examine all city policies and practices to identify those that put non-married couples at a disadvantage. Eventually, homosexual and unmarried heterosexual partners could have legal standing in real estate and rental contracts and could become eligible for rental and housing programs offered now only to traditionally families. Sick leave for city employees whose lovers or parents are seriously ill also would be expanded. Partners also would have hospital and jail visitation rights similar to traditional family members. By city charter, supervisors can only ask the city's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, an independent agency that runs city hospitals, clinics and health benefit programs, to extend benefits to domestic partners. With <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> as mayor, <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> hopes the department's compliance will be routine If adopted, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> would be the only major metropolitan city with such a measure. Several other cities, including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, currently are studying the issue. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, which has a large homosexual population, also offers a domestic partnership certificate, and 219 couples have registered since 1985.

 Nine members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> warned in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman that a proposed reduction in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget could so cripple the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space station that `` cancellation becomes a real option.'' The letter, sent to Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., on Tuesday said that a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a $ 1.3 billion reduction in budget authority for general science and space would be absorbed largely by reducing the amount allocated for Space Station Freedom Cutting the station, the letter said, would be `` tragic'' for the country because it would affect the nation's ability to produce and utilize new technology that could be developed in space. `` It is imperative that we are not penny-wise and pound foolish with our civil space program,'' said the letter. `` The competitiveness of future generations depends on our vision.'' The letter was signed Reps. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa.; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippo </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> `` This year is a crucial year in the development of the station and a year when the funding must increase to keep the project on track,'' the letter said. `` A cut of this magnitude may not ` kill' the space station, but it will so handicap its development that cancellation becomes a real option. In a related letter to <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, acting administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said that if the space budget cut proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution becomes law, `` we would have no choice but to restructure the entire civil space program and, without doubt, the space station would be a major victim.'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> added: `` Discontinuation of the space station would be a national tragedy. We would be cutting more than the space program; we would be discarding our nation's aspirations for, and investment in, the future.'' The space station would be a permanently orbiting laboratory that would permit astronauts and scientists to spend months in space. The station also would have facilities for industrial research. It is to be built with the joint cooperation and funding of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, said the space station received about $ 900 million under the fiscal 1989 budget that ends Sept. 30, and that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has asked for about $ 1.5 billion for fiscal 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is to consider appropriations for general science and space on Thursday.

<HEAD>Private, USDA Forecasters Disagree on Crop Conditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's an awkward time for crop and weather forecasters who remember last year's drought and searing heat. Some say it's too early to tell what to expect. Others say it's later than you think Analysts in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat crop could be significantly larger than last year's drought-reduced harvest. And they point out that most of this year's corn has n't even been planted yet On the other hand, private economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said Tuesday that poor moisture reserves in much of the nation's midsection have already taken a bite out of this year's crop yields And it could worsen if the rains are n't abundant this spring. <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Schnittker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based agricultural consulting firm, said that the 1988 drought `` remains the leading force in world agriculture,'' at least until more is known about this year's crops of wheat and corn. Both <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> project huge declines in world and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inventories as a result of last year's drought-shriveled yields in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. By July 1, he said, the global grain inventory going into the new 1989-90 season will be down to a 61-day supply, compared with an 87-day reserve last summer. That will be the smallest reserve since the early 1970s, when global grain stocks were drawn down to a 57-day supply. Speaking to a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said the supply situation puts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` sort of on the razor's edge'' because of the uncertainties about 1989 crop conditions. Although many areas are dramatically improved from last summer's drought, parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and Corn Belt are still woefully dry Even in some areas that have moderate surface moisture, the reserves deep in the subsoil are scant. `` And if we do have a second adverse crop-growing season, the effect will be substantially larger in the commodities markets and in the consumer food retail markets than they have been the past year,'' <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said. The reduced 1988 harvests forced up market prices for the major crops as it became apparent that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> granary would be partially emptied. <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said he finds himself `` disagreeing quite a lot'' with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief meteorologist, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>, who told the farm writers earlier that he was still optimistic about crop conditions improving and that nationally the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can have a productive year. <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> and others maintain that the fate of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat crop will not be known for another month or so and that farmers still have not planted spring wheat or made much of a dent in planting corn. `` If I seem a little on the optimistic side, it may be that I'm looking at changes that have occurred and the improvements that have taken place since the fall of 1988 and the real harshness of the 1988 drought,'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said Acknowledging that there are `` pockets'' of drought problems still around _ <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, for example, where about 75 percent of the winter wheat is reported in very poor or poor condition _ <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said many other sections of the country have had good moisture last year in recent months. `` When you put all of the big parts together, the overall outlook for the country is much improved over what it was last year,'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said. `` But we are still deeply concerned about the pockets and the problems we have in the western <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the central part of the Corn Belt.'' <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> `` may turn out to be right, but it seems to me, with the extreme ... subsoil drought concentrated on the central Corn Belt at the moment, that it is prudent for private forecasters, at least, to reduce the probable corn yield a little bit.'' Already, he said, the moisture problems have shaved this year's average corn yield somewhat If all had been normal, the yield trend pointed to an average of about 120 bushels per acre, but <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> says he thinks 115 bushels are more likely. That would mean a 1989 corn harvest of about 7.54 billion bushels, up from 5.1 billion bushels estimated for 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> currently estimates last year's corn harvest at 4.92 billion bushels but has not projected the 1989 crop. Based on April 25 conditions, <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> forecast this year's total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat harvest at 2.15 billion bushels, about 300 million bushels less than the output would be if moisture conditions had been normal Last year's wheat harvest was 1.81 billion bushels.

<HEAD>Safety Board Calls California Facility `Understaffed Pigpen'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal safety board is trying to stop the workload from increasing at a major southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> air traffic control center that officials say already has the reputation of an `` understaffed pigpen.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, after a special investigation into nine operational errors at the Coast Radar Approach Control facility in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, raised questions Tuesday about the center's ability to keep airplanes from flying into each other. `` You've got an understaffed pigpen here, by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s own evaluation,'' said board member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. He referred to a statement by former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Engen </PERSON>, who in 1986 visited the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> center and dubbed it `` the pigpen of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The board said controllers at the center regularly work six-day weeks directing half a million flights a year between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Board staff members said there have been reports of health problems at the center, with employees taking excessive sick leave and complaining about working conditions. Full staff at the facility would be 66, but the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has only been able to find 24 qualified controllers, primarily because of the high cost of living in the area. The board recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> seek to hire local military personnel and others as assistant controllers so regular controllers at the facility can receive additional training. The board, which met for four hours, said it opposed <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> plans to expand the center and nearly double the workload unless the staff can also be at least doubled. The board also called for a national task force to develop changes in procedures at the center. An investigation began after a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet and a smaller <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner came within 1.9 miles of each other at the same altitude on Feb. 13 over <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The planes were far enough apart to avoid a `` near miss'' incident, but <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules require aircraft in the area to be separated by at least three miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. The board blamed the incident on a controller who was distracted by other duties at the facility. The inquiry was expanded after investigators found there had been seven other operational errors in the past year. A ninth occurred April 6. They also recorded several complaints from officials and employees at the center. The board urged that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> give a high priority to consolidation of air traffic control operations now handled by separate facilities at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. But board members acknowledged it could take five years or more to build the new center for which a site has not yet been selected. In another safety matter related to air traffic in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the board called for a review of pre-arranged or `` silent coordination'' procedure used by controllers in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and some other areas `` to determine if there is any degradation of safety.'' The procedure, formerly outlawed by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, allows controllers to send planes from one control area to another without orally alerting the controller who is to take over handling of the plane. The board inquiry was its first major investigation into an air traffic control operation since it began recommending upgrading at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s O ` Hare International Airport after operational errors increased there in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has started a program to give <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> controllers extra pay, and officials have said they expect the center to be up to full staff by May. The pay program was originally intended to apply to several facilities where the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has had difficulty hiring controllers, but board members said there are moves in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to limit the pay incentive to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Heart Drugs Withdrawn for Patients with Mildly Irregular Heartbeats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors should stop using the drugs Tambocor and Enkaid to treat patients with mildly irregular heartbeats because studies show an unexpectedly high death rate among users, federal authorities say. The two drugs may continue to be used to treat patients in emergencies in which the heart has slipped into a life-threatening rhythm. About 200,000 heart patients take the medicines regularly, and most of these patients suffer only from mild heartbeat irregularities, officials at the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The rate of deaths among patients taking the drugs was discovered only after a mortality study was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> NHLBI </ORGANIZATION>. The study was intended to determine if heart attack patients who suffered mild heartbeat irregularities lived longer if they took medicine to modify that irregular beat, or arrhythmia. Instead, the study found that death was almost twice as frequent among those who took the drugs as among those who took the placebo. `` I was stunned and shocked when I was presented with the results of the drug trials,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigger </PERSON>, chairman of the institute's steering committee for the drug trials. A third drug, called moricizine, will continue to be used in the drug trials. That drug is not now on the market and has no brand name. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> director, said that letters will be sent to doctors to modify the use of <LOCATION> Tambocor </LOCATION> and Enkaid and that labeling instructions also will be changed. Doctors are being advised to discontinue use of the two drugs for patients with only mild heartbeat irregularities. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said, however, that patients taking the medicines should not change the use or dosage until instructed to do so by a physician. Tambocor and Enkaid are the only members of a pharmaceutical class called 1C. Drugs in this group work to slow electrical conduction in the heart fiber. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that there are other drugs still on the market for treatment of mild heartbeat irregularities and that mortality studies have not been conducted for them. Tambocor is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> 3M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. Its generic name is flecainide. Enkaid, whose generic name is encainide, is manufactured by Bristol-Myers. Representatives of both the drug companies said they were working with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to change the instructions on how their drugs could be used. A Bristol-Myers official said that patients with unused drugs could be reimbursed but a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Riker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> said no decision had been made by his company on that issue. In the drug study, researchers were to select a total of 4,400 patients, aged up to 80, who had suffered a heart attack, recovered and then experienced mild arrhythmias. Patients with such heartbeat irregularities are known to have a two-to-three-times greater chance of dying from a later heart attack than those without such heart arrhythmias. Half of the patients in the study were prescribed one of the three drugs, Tambocor, Enkaid or moricizine. The other half of the patients were to take a placebo, usually a sugar pill. The study began in June 1987, and is still enrolling patients. On April 17, a board monitoring the safety of the trial noted that of 730 patients receiving <LOCATION> Tambocor </LOCATION> and Enkaid for about 10 months, 57 died or suffered cardiac arrest, while of 725 patients receiving placebos, only 22 died of cardiac arrest.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rebounded sharply after a setback earlier Wednesday, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged up against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 438.86 points Tuesday, added another 190.15 points, or 0.57 percent, to finish trading at 33,434.93. The index lost 51.39 points during morning trading, but recovered in the afternoon session. The dollar ended at 131.47 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's 131.17 yen close It started at 131.38 yen and fluctuated between 131.30 yen and 131.53 yen. Stock dealers said the index began to rise when institutional investors bought issues following the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s morning plunge to pick up cheaper issues. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1.3 billion shares, up from 800 million on Tuesday. The currency rate moved little, mainly due to political uncertainty stemming from the announcement Tuesday that Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> would resign soon and speculation about interest rate hikes in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, traders said. Facing opposition calls for his resignation and public distrust in his government tainted with a stock-profeteering scandal that surfaced last summer, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced Tuesday that he would step down as soon as <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passes the fiscal 1989 budget. Also commenting on a possible move by the central bank to raise its interest rates, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said; `` It's a matter of timing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told a meeting of bank branch chiefs the previous day that the central bank would promptly take appropriate measures if prices become unstable.

<NOTE>Spotted Owl Worthy Of Protection, Agency Decides</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has reversed course and decided to give the spotted owl protection as a threatened species. Environmentalists hope the decision will save the ancient forests of the Northwest. The timber industry says the move could lock up vast areas of the region to logging. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> had given the agency until Monday to review its decision of more than a year ago not to list the owl under the Endangered Species Act. `` We will present a finding to the court that listing of the owl as a threatened species is warranted and begin steps to officially propose it for listing,'' said <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Once the owl is proposed for listing as a threatened species, a year-long review will begin during which management plans for protection of the bird could be developed and public comment sought. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in December 1987 refused to list the owl and environmental groups filed suit. District Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON> ruled the initial decision not to list the owl was `` arbitrary and capricious'' and gave the agency until May 1 to review its decision.

 A light drizzle was falling and a breeze blew across Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> when Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> radioed the grounded <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> for a damage report. `` Ah, not at the present time, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>,'' the tanker skipper replied in a deep, slow voice. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> here. A little problem here with the third mate but we're working our way off the reef. We've, ah, been holed and we're ascertaining right now, we're trying just to get her off the reef and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.'' Two hours later, the magnitude of the spill became clear to <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> when the tanker reported that 138,000 barrels _ about 5.7 million gallons _ of oil had been spilled into the water, according to transcripts of radio conversations released Tuesday. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, who had been roused from bed in the early morning hours of March 24, told <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> to `` take it slow and easy'' after the skipper said he was trying to dislodge vessel from the reef. `` You know, I'm telling you the obvious, but take it slow and easy, and we're getting help out as fast as we can,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. `` We're in pretty good shape right now, stability-wise, and, ah, trying to extract her off the shoal here,'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> answered. `` You can probably see me on you radar, and, ah, once we get under way, I'll let you know, do another damage control assessment.'' `` Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you do n't you know, start doing any ripping,'' said <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>. `` You got a rising tide, you, another, about an hour and a half worth of tide in your favor, ah, ah, once you hit that max, I would n't recommend doing much wiggling.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> responded that `` major damage has kind of been done and we kind of rock and rolled over it. We're just kind of hung up on the stern here. We're just, ah, we'll drift over it. Ah, I'll get back to you. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> did n't sound inebriated. `` I perceived his voice to be that of someone stressed, concerned about his vessel,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is charged with operating the vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of pollution into the water, all misdemeanors. Among other developments: _ The state says 11.2 million gallons actually spilled <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had estimated it at 10.1 million gallons. _ Seas up to 15 feet and gale force winds stymied oil skimmers and today's forecast offered little hope of a break _ Hatcheries this week released the first 62 million salmon fry into the sound since the spill, though their fate is uncertain, said the <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquaculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> The release was timed to coincide with the peak of flowering for plankton that provide food for the tiny fish. `` You ca n't stop Mother Nature,'' said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the non-profit association. The pink salmon fry, which made up most of the release, are due to return as adult fish in the summer of 1990. _ Two crews traveled six hours from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to Green and Seal islands where by Thursday they will use propane cannons and `` screamer shells'' to scare away migratory birds stopping over on the oil-coated beaches The taped conversations between the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the tanker were released after a Freedom of Information Act request from the Anchorage Daily News. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was not on the bridge when the ship ran aground but had turned over the tanker to his third mate, who was n't licensed to steer the ship through the sound. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Madson </PERSON>, says his client will return to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> voluntarily, perhaps as early as next week and definitely before a May 5 extradition hearing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> stopped short of endorsing <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s attempt to refloat the tanker but said he `` probably used all his mariner's skills'' after the ship ran aground. Not knowing whether he was stuck, rocking the boat gently was an appropriate decision by <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> that probably did n't worsen the spill, <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. `` Once he satisfied himself the vessel was going to stay there, he shut his engines down,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. Had the ship freed itself from the reef it probably would have sunk, he added. Judging whether <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s decisions were appropriate `` is a tough shot to call from a warm office,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. The ship's captain is `` always in a better position to determine his fate than we are.

 A former fruit picker enjoyed his first taste of freedom today after 21 years in prison because a judge said perjury and prosecutorial misconduct got him convicted in the deaths of his seven children. `` I do n't feel freedom yet,'' 53-year-old <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said Tuesday following an eight-hour hearing in the <LOCATION> DeSoto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse where he had been sentenced to death in 1968. `` I guess it's going to take a while to get use to it, but I'm going to keep trying to make that step. Retired Circuit Judge <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, assigned to review the case by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, freed the black man who was convicted by an all-white jury after agreeing with defense attorneys that prosecutors allowed perjured testimony and withheld evidence. `` The enormity of the crime _ seven children poisoned to death _ is matched only by the enormity of the injustice to this man,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. Although the state has 10 days to order a retrial, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, a special investigator assigned to the case, said it will be closed. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was released in the custody of attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, who took him to his condominium near <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where a press conference was scheduled for this afternoon. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s first wish was to eat a shrimp dinner, said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was freed, his wife, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, cried on the courthouse lawn, threw her arms up and said `` Thank you, thank you.'' `` Right now I feel fine,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` Within my heart, I knew that these great men were going to get me out _ they were n't going to let me stay in there. In addition to <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, he was referring to attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, whose 1971 book `` Arcadia'' raised questions about the conviction in the October 1967 poisonings. `` A long and crooked path has brought us back to <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` And after 21 years, it's appropriate that it should end up again in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> accused former State Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> of railroading <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> into a death sentence, which was commuted to life in prison in 1972. They said <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> manufactured testimony against <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> because of shoddy investigation and a failure to find another suspect. They said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was an easy target because he was illiterate, poor and black. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> has filed a defamation of character lawsuit against the two attorneys. He also accused state officials of conducting `` a hatchet job'' and called <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> `` a child-killer.'' And retired Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON>, who sentenced <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, said, `` As far as I am concerned, a mass murderer is going to walk the streets.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state attorney appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to look into the case, said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> did not get a fair trial. She said <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> and then-Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treadwell </PERSON> withheld `` six key pieces of exculpatory evidence ... that could have changed the outcome.'' Lane charged that <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, <PERSON> Treadwell </PERSON> and then-Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> forced jail inmates and others to testify against <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and suppressed evidence favorable to the defendant. The defense also presented testimony pointing to babysitter <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reece </PERSON> as a prime suspect. Ms. <PERSON> Reece </PERSON>, 67, is in an <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is unable to communicate with anyone, although two nurses filed affidavits last year that she confessed to serving the children the pesticide-laced food. The children, ages 2 to 8, died within hours after eating a lunch of grits, beans, rice and gravy laced with parathion, which is now banned. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said he and his wife were working in a citrus grove in the southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farming community when their children were poisoned. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> told the judge that <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> deserved not only freedom but compensation from the state. The governor responded, `` Mr. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> has lost too many years of his life in prison, but my hope is that this decision will give him an opportunity to rebuild.''

 Bowing to audience complaints and advertiser defections, the executive producer of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s fleshy `` Nightingales'' said the series will show less skin and more nurses in uniform. `` We did some things we're not proud of,'' <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelling </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday. `` Mostly, we want to add to the patient-nurse relationship.'' The one-hour drama depicts the trials of five less-than-brilliant and lusty nursing students. Spelling said if <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> renews the show, it would return without lacy lingerie, bouncy aerobic workouts and locker-room gossip-disrobing sessions. Critics, including irate nurses, said it demeaned the nursing profession specifically and women generally. `` Nightingales'' is one of several television programs criticized recently by advocacy groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Married ... With Children'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live'' have been slammed for their frank language and candid sexual references, and national advertisers have backed out of both programs. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have pulled spots from `` Nightingales.'' `` We're in a no-win situation,'' Spelling said of the assaults on the show, which premiered in January. `` We've been beaten over the head with baseball bats.'' Spelling, whose program `` Charlie's Angels'' brought bikinis and hot tubs to the world of TV private detectives, said the new `` Nightingales'' would have characters saying lines like, `` All I want to do is be a good nurse and help.'' The show's critics included <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employees and several nursing schools. `` They're bimbos,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a president in the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said of the `` Nightingales'' characters. `` They're flighty females with few brain cells and they're not competent. The show does n't depict the nursing practice as it is today.'' Spelling said he will add a nursing adviser to the show's staff and deal more realistically with the profession. He said, though, that the nurses will continue to have personal lives. `` I'm not going to tell you there will never be a love scene in ` Nightingales,''' Spelling said. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON>, one of the show's co-stars, said at the news conference that the actresses depicting the young nurses have been uncomfortable with some of the scenes they've been asked to play, finding them `` repugnant.'' <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON> said the show had erred in its fascination with the nurses' shaving their legs and the `` ridiculous underwear'' some of the nurses were asked to step into. `` We make our mistakes often,'' she said. `` We started from scratch and we were struggling. A lot of things we saw we did n't like. Spelling said that in summer reruns, a much-discussed scene involving a nurse having sex in a linen closet will be excised from an episode. Although `` Nightingales'' has won its Wednesday night time period in television ratings, its future is not certain. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision about renewing it is expected within three weeks Spelling and <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON> said they were concerned that advocacy-group complaints might possibly cross the line into censorship. Said Spelling: `` If you bow to every group of censors, there will be no television.''

<HEAD>Transcript Describes Eight Frantic Minutes In The Air</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The crew of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 struggled with their crippled jetliner for eight minutes before they realized passengers had been swept to their deaths through a giant hole in the plane, a transcript shows. The transcript from the cockpit recorder was released Tuesday as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> opened a three-day hearing into why the forward cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off shortly after the plane left <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Feb. 24. Nine passengers were killed. Eight minutes after the trouble began, flight engineer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> returned to the cockpit after inspecting the damage. `` The right side is gone ... it's just open. You're just lookin' outside,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told pilot <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> `` Looks like a bomb,'' he said. `` Fuselage?'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> asked. `` Yes, fuselage, it's just open,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` Some people are probably gone. I do n't know.'' Six seconds of silence followed, then the crew frantically discussed flying the plane. At the hearing, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> testified that the 747's 800-pound cargo doors are safe. But <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> told of a 1987 incident in which a 747 cargo door partially opened on a flight out of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, forcing the jetliner to return to the airport. More than a dozen times during the past six years <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s turned back in flight because of indications that a cargo bay door was open, federal investigators said. There has been speculation the cargo door might have broken free when the latching mechanism failed. After the United accident, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to reinforce the relatively lightweight aluminum latch mechanisms with steel. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, with 337 passengers and a crew of 18, when the accident occurred. The transcript showed the crew worried about staying airborne, boosted each other's spirits during the harrowing 25-minute return to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Minutes into the flight, at 2:09 a.m. HST, pilot <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> asked: `` What the -LRB- expletive -RRB- was that?'' `` I do n't know,'' replied <PERSON> Slader </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. A loud bang is heard Power to the recording unit then was interrupted for 21 seconds before an alarm horn is heard. `` Goin down,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said, followed by `` Emergency descent.'' `` I think we blew a door ... or something,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said seconds later. The crew shut down the damaged No. 3 engine and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, began dumping fuel. At 2:13, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Incline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, said: `` I think we might have some damage out there.'' `` We got a control problem here,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said seconds later. At 2:14, he noted a problem with the No. 4 engine, and the crew discussed flying the massive plane on just two engines. `` Can you maintain 240 -LRB- knots -RRB-?'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> asked. `` Yeah, just barely,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> replied. `` Yeah but we're losing altitude,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said. `` I know it,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said. Then at 2:16, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> announced he had no fuel flow to No. 4 engine. `` What a -LRB- expletive -RRB- of a thing to happen on your, ah, second to last month,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> told <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. `` No -LRB- expletive -RRB-,'' replied <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, who was on his second-to-last flight. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> retired 10 days later, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60. Immediately after, <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> noted a fire on the No. 4 engine. `` Go through the procedure, shut down the engine,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said. `` We're not gon na be able to hold this altitude on two -LRB- engines -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> warned against flying too fast because of the gaping hole, and <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> wondered what the minimum airspeed was under the circumstances. At 2:24, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> announced he could n't hold altitude. `` OK do n't, OK, ah well, we have 24 miles to go and we're drifting down slowly,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> replied `` You're gon na make it,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` Make sure we do n't hit any -LRB- expletive -RRB- hills on the way,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> added. Shortly after, <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> reported seeing the lights of the airport. `` OK ... we're 21 miles out and we're in good shape,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.S. Senator Confirms Investigation By Ethics Committee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> says his investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> concerning a lucrative book contract is leftover from his re-election bid and will come to nothing. `` The only reason there's an investigation is because in the middle of my campaign, a bunch of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawyers decided they wanted to make an issue out of something that was old news,'' the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Republican said. `` And the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has to follow up the investigation.'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> confirmed Tuesday that the committee was investigating a complaint that he `` laundered'' $ 100,000 in speaking fees in a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Piranha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> for books written under his name on defense and health issues. The deal appeared similar to the one that landed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in political hot water, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigation has no connection with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s queries into allegations against the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. `` Mine was a legal arrangement,'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said. `` This coincides with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, so it gets to be a little more news. I ca n't imagine that there will be any consequences at all.'' A group of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> attorneys, many of whom are Democratic officeholders or party activists, filed a complaint in September with the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> about the book-publishing deal. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> had abandoned the arrangement more than a year earlier in the face of criticism. The complaint alleges that <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> collected about $ 100,000 in personal income by circumventing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s self-imposed limit on speaking fees. It alleges he redefined his audiences with various interest groups as `` promotional appearances'' for the sale of his books. The money from those appearances went to a publisher and then back to <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>. Senators are paid $ 89,500 a year and they can keep up to 40 percent more in speaking fees, or $ 35,800. For 1987, <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> reported an income range of $ 147,456 - $ 163,550 with honoraria of $ 50,050, of which $ 15,350 was given to charity. In the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has voted to charge the speaker with using his book publishing contract to evade the limits on outside income. The committee said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> encouraged groups to buy his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' instead of paying him a normal speaking fee. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> or his staff members have said the senator cleared his book-promotion arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The complaint alleges that the senator may have misrepresented the exact nature of the deal to the commission. The complaint was filed during <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s campaign to retain his seat against a bid by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> state Attorney General <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tessmer </PERSON> acknowledged in September that the campaign provided information to help the lawyers group prepare the complaint. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said members of his staff have been interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and said he expects to meet with the committee. An official for the committee would not confirm or deny any investigation.

 Police said they found no witnesses to verify a report by TV host <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> that he was attacked in an airport bathroom by skinheads who painted swastikas on him and tried to shave his hair. As police Tuesday continued an investigation of the incident, <ORGANIZATION> KOFY-TV </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> said he would cancel local broadcast of <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s show if police find the tale was concocted as a publicity stunt. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> responded to reports that his claim could not be substantiated, saying he would have to be `` bordering on a little bit of insanity'' to have made up the attack. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, 56, was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to promote his show when he said he was attacked in a restroom at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> by someone who `` put his arm around my throat and his other hand across my eyes and dragged me to a stall,'' he said. `` They sat me down on the toilet. One guy sat on me, and another one started cutting my hair,'' said the bombastic program host known for his arrogant, aggressive style. About the time <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he was assaulted, a bomb threat forced <ORGANIZATION> KOFY </ORGANIZATION> to leave the air during the time slot for the syndicated series. The show returned to the air after about 30 minutes. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said that the assault story is true but can not be verified because police were not in the bathroom where he was jumped. `` You can listen to all the other stories of people who were n't there, but that's fine,'' said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> WWOR-TV </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where he returned later Tuesday Police at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said they were investigating the incident reported to them at 11:30 p.m. Monday. `` What he's claiming does n't appear to be the case at all,'' airport spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` We have not yet been able to confirm any of the statements Mr. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> made.'' Authorities found no evidence of skinheads in the area, he added. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was cleanly dressed when spotted later in a limousine at the airport and showed no signs of being in a scuffle, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Scissors and a marking pen were found in the restroom, but no physical signs of a fight were present, he said. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> displayed swastikas scrawled across his face, shirt and pants. His right eye was bloodshot and bruised, his head partially cut. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he believed his assailants to be skinheads, young white supremacists with shaved heads who have been reviled on his television show.

 Voters cast ballots today to fill <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s lone seat in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, vacated when <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was nominated defense secretary. The 40-day campaign often turned negative with the two frontrunners, Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, engaging in heated exchanges. The special election was watched by both national parties. The Republicans hoped to salvage some pride after earlier this year losing special elections in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>; Democratics hoped for a sweep with a Vinich victory. Officials predict turnout will be about 65 percent of registered voters, slightly lower than normal. Some voters had had enough of the campaign. `` It's negative. It's dirty. It's sleazy,'' <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign that called into question <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s integrity and the Democratic portrayal of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> as a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> pawn. Appearing on the ballot as independents were <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> railroad engineer who collected just 1,900 votes when he ran for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat as a <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> last November, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a white separatist who moved from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> in mid-March. Neither <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> were expected to gain many votes, although the Casper Star-Tribune, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, endorsed <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> because of the `` assassination politics'' displayed by <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. In the last 10 days, polling by the Democrats and Republicans showed a slight trend toward <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> has been campaigning for 19 months, beginning when he entered a race for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>'s seat. He narrowly lost, and then won the Democratic nomination for <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s seat. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 56, is general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> who was elected in November to his third term in the Legislature. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>, 38, is a restaurant and bar owner who has spent the last 15 years in the Legislature. At one point in the race, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> seemed on the verge of torpedoing its own man's campaign. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, a high-paid strategist hired to reverse <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fortunes, played into <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s hands by declaring that he was calling the shots for <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> is something I've had hands on since day one,'' said <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> used the comments to charge that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> did n't control his campaign. But the Democrats had their share of mistakes. The bulk of <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s campaign contributions came from out-of-state labor groups; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> then portrayed the Democrat as beholden to organized labor with little <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> support. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> also attacked <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> for being `` soft on crime'' because of a legislative vote the Republican cast in favor of a split-sentencing bill. But the bill was opposed by only two legislators and even former Gov. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Herschler </PERSON>, a highly popular Democrat, disagreed with <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s position.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Three Out Of Four American Indian College Students Drop
Out</HEAD>

 Nearly 75 percent of American Indian college students do n't earn degrees because of poor academic preparation, inadequate financial aid or personal problems, according to a survey. `` The simple truth is most Native Americans and their families ... do not have the financial resources required to pay their college bills,'' concluded the study, `` The Forgotten Minority: Native Americans in Higher Education,'' by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. The survey, conducted by mail in August, included responses from 33 two - and four-year institutions with at least 4 percent American Indian enrollment It found that graduation rates had improved slightly during the 1980s, thanks primarily to better minority counseling and support systems on some campuses. But the study concluded that retention and graduation rates remain `` disturbingly low.'' It found that 27.3 percent of American Indian students entering college earned degrees, but more than half drop out in their freshman year. According to federal statistics, 20.1 percent of American Indian college students from the high school class of 1980 earned either bachelor's degrees or two-year associate degrees. Fifty-five percent of all students in four-year private schools and 46 percent of four-year public college students eventually earn bachelor's degrees, according to federal figures. Some 91,000 of the 12.5 million students in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges are American Indians or Alaskan natives, according to latest <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> figures. The average cost of attending the schools in the survey was $ 5,400, but the average financial aid grant was $ 1,531 per student. That leaves at least a $ 3,000 unmet need for each American Indian student. In an interview, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> also cited lack of Indian faculty at the institutions surveyed. There were an average of nine such teachers at the colleges surveyed. At his own institution, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, there are three Indians on the staff but none are classroom teachers, he said. On the positive side, nearly half the schools surveyed, 16, had teacher training programs tailored for American Indians. The colleges cited four culprits hindering <PERSON> American </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> college students: inadequate academic preparation, difficulty adjusting to the college environment, personal and family problems, and financial difficulties. Some of the personal problems include lack of family support, homesickness, substance abuse and inadequate transportation, the survey found. Without solid support system on campus, `` the Native American student will often split before the academic, financial or personal problem is addressed,'' it said.

<TEXT>
 New federal tax laws and the 1987 stock market crash put the squeeze on gifts to colleges and universities, with contributions declining in 1987-88 for the first time in 13 years. `` The boomy days appear to be over, on campus as on Wall Street,'' concluded an annual survey released Tuesday by the Council for Aid to Education. It estimated that gifts to higher education totaled $ 8.2 billion in the 1987-88 school year, down 3.5 percent from the $ 8.5 billion the previous year. It was only the third year-to-year decline since the council began the survey in 1954-55, said spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. But council officials noted the decline followed two years of explosive growth in contributions, when alumni giving increased by 25 percent a year. `` The increases we have been logging over the past decade, averaging some 12 percent annually, just could not be sustained indefinitely,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haire </PERSON>, the council's president. <PERSON> Haire </PERSON> said donors apparently decided to make major gifts before Jan. 1, 1987, anticipating changes in federal tax law that made charitable contributions less advantageous. The October 1987 stock market collapse further depressed the level of contributions, <PERSON> Haire </PERSON> said. The council said it did not expect a quick return to double-digit annual increases. Alumni giving in 1987-88 totaled $ 2.04 billion, down 13 percent from the previous year's $ 2.34 billion. Non-alumni contributions were $ 1.93 billion, off 6.7 percent from $ 2.04 billion. Corporate giving totaled $ 1.85 billion, up 1.9 percent from $ 1.82 billion a year ago. Foundation support rose 6.2 percent, from $ 1.5 billion to $ 1.6 billion. Religious organizations donated $ 197 million, 3.4 percent less than the $ 204 million a year earlier, and contributions from other sources totaled $ 574 million, up 4 percent from $ 552 million in 1986-87. The survey results were based on data gathered from 1,142 colleges and universities accounting for about 85 percent of all private gifts received by higher education institutions. The top 20 fund raisers among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges and universities were: <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 181.9 million; <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 155.1 million; <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 142 million; <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 121.2 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, $ 109.5 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, $ 106.2 million; <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, $ 97.4 million; <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, $ 96.9 million; <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 93.7 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION>, $ 89.1 million; <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 85.9 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, $ 82 million; <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 78.8 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, $ 74.5 million; <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 70.6 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, $ 68.2 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, $ 68 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>, $ 66.8 million; <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 66.1 million, and <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 65.9 million.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said today that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has expelled or refused to re-admit 18 Britons in apparent retaliation for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s expulsion of 18 Iranians in the dispute over <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s `` The Satanic Verses.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has formally protested the Iranian move through the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> began looking after British interests in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on March 7 after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> refused to ban <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel. Moslem clerics say the book blasphemes Islam. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, told Moslems on Feb. 14 to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for writing the novel. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, an Indian-born British citizen, has been in hiding since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s threat, which was backed by the offer of a $ 5.2 million bounty from two Iranian Moslem clergymen. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who in accordance with British practice declined to be named, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deadline for the Britons to leave expired Tuesday and some were already back in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` We first heard something was happening on April 19,'' the spokesman said. `` As we understand it, some -LRB- of the 18 -RRB- were people who were in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> at the time they were expelled and are simply not being allowed to return. `` They appear to have been a pretty random cross-section of the Britons who are there. Some of them were long-term residents, some were businessmen, some were academics _ a whole cross-section. `` We have told <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> that the action is completely unjustified.'' He could not say what official reason <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had given for its action over the 18 Britons. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government said when it announced the expulsion of the 18 Iranians that they were perceived as a security threat. Several of the 18 expelled Iranians were classified as students in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who also worked at the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Guilty pleas by two men accused of smuggling illegal animal drugs should serve as a warning to farmers and veterinarians who consider using unapproved chemicals, government spokesmen said. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, a veterinarian from <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dall </PERSON>, an importer from <LOCATION> Ossining </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, each pleaded guilty to two felonies in a hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and another of making a false statement. <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and another stemming from the importing of the illegal drug chloramphenicol. Both face up to 10 years in prison. <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> could be fined more than $ 500,000 and <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> up to $ 260,000. Seventeen additional charges against <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> and a dozen additional charges against <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> will be dismissed when the men are sentenced July 18. <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> and a third man who previously pleaded guilty were charged in November with conspiring to ship tons of outlawed drugs from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to animal feed manufacturers, veterinarians and sometimes directly to farmers throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` These three were among the largest people involved in the black market trade,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> LaHaie </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer. Two of the 16 drugs involved are prohibited for use on any animal being raised for food in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and three other drugs are prohibited in hogs or cattle because of their toxicity. The government said four others are carcinogens and one, chloramphenicol, is a powerful antibiotic that has been linked to aplastic anemia, a leukemialike blood disorder. The antibiotics are mixed with feed to prevent the spread of disease in animals. <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, president and general manager of the now defunct Custom Feed Blenders of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, were accused of masterminding a scheme to truck tons of the untested, improperly packaged or illegal veterinary drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, camouflaging the cargo in truckloads of wood chips or furniture. <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, who earlier pleaded guilty to three counts, will be sentenced Aug. 25. He faces a maximum of 10 years in jail and a fine of up to $ 750,000. As part of their pleas, all three also agreed to cooperate with the government in future prosecutions against other illegal importers. Farmers and veterinarians who used the drugs will not be charged, <PERSON> LaHaie </PERSON> said. But he said the case should be a warning to them to use only approved drugs. `` I think most of them are law-abiding and they'll straighten up,'' he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Teske </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said the guilty pleas were a mixed blessing. `` I think a trial would have provided a good deal of focus and public attention on this issue, so we'll lose some of that,'' he said. `` But you never know what a jury is going to do.'' He said he hopes the pleas would send a signal to farmers and others who might be tempted to avoid higher prices of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved drugs `` We think it's important for people to understand the dangers of using drugs that are essentially untried and not subjected to the quality control process of those approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Teske </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Victim Of Bomb at Indianapolis K mart Undergoes Eye Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Doctors removed the lens of the left eye from the 5-year-old victim of last week's K mart bombing, but they refused to speculate on whether she would regain at least partial vision in the eye. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> remained in satisfactory condition after Tuesday's two-hour operation at <LOCATION> Methodist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she has been since the April 17 bombing at a K mart store Most of her left hand was blown off and her eye ripped open when she picked up a pump toothpaste container and detonated a concealed pipe bomb filled with gunpowder and BB shot. The lens had to be removed to avoid inflammation and further damage, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minturn </PERSON>, an eye specialist who operated on <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>. The lens is located behind the iris and focuses light toward the back of the eye. The blood that was within the left eye is showing signs of dispersing, <PERSON> Minturn </PERSON> said. `` Still, we'll need time and further healing to decide and see how much vision she'll recover,'' he added. The loss of a lens may require her to wear a corrective lens. `` If her eye has some potential vision in it, possibly a contact lens would correct the loss of the normal lens,'' <PERSON> Minturn </PERSON> said at a hospital news conference. Investigators said Tuesday that a woman who telephoned the K mart to apologize for the bombing likely was not involved. `` The kind of statements she made could really be made by anybody,'' said Detective <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Of more than 400 calls received by authorities, Monday's call was the first confessing to the bombing, investigators said. Investigators have concentrated their search on two men seen leaving the store moments after the blast. One of those men, they believe, might have bought BB shot at the same K mart three days before the explosion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Univeristy </ORGANIZATION> researchers plan to proceed with adrenal tissue transplants to treat Parkinson's disease, even though only four of its 18 transplant patients showed distinct improvement The university performed the nation's first adrenal tissue transplant in April 1987. Hospital officials in December announced a clinical trial of 240 Parkinson's patients, half of whom would undergo the surgery, to determine the transplants' benefits. Early results are expected to be published next week in the <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurology </ORGANIZATION>. The publication follows a recent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurology </ORGANIZATION> report urging `` great caution'' before large-scale human studies of the procedure are launched. An estimated 100 adrenal tissue transplants have been performed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Parkinson's disease, which afflicts an estimated 1.5 million Americans, is marked by trembling and muscular rigidity, and is caused by degeneration of the basel ganglia of the brain. <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> neurosurgeon <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulipan </PERSON> agreed doctors should move slowly. `` I think a lot of people started doing this operation without having the vaguest idea what they were doing. The result is we still do n't know what the real benefits of the operation are and that's the real reason for us to do the study we're doing,'' he said. The surgery involves removing one of the patient's adrenal glands _ on the upper part of the kidney _ and grafting the adrenal medulla, or inner core, from the gland into a specific nucleus of the brain. Based on the four patients who showed improvement, researchers have been unable to determine which patients are more likely to benefit from the operation. The Parkinson's trial under way at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> will help determine which, if any, patients suffering from the crippling disorder will benefit from the operation, <PERSON> Tulipan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> researchers led by Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, chairman of neurosurgery, reported improvements that lasted for at least one year in patients with mild, as well as severe, <ORGANIZATION> Parkinson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. The 18 patients, ages 35 to 69, were followed up at either six or 12 months. <PERSON> Tulipan </PERSON> said no patient worsened because of the operation. One patient died from a heart attack unrelated to the transplant, he said. The reasons for the improvements are unknown, but <PERSON> Tulipan </PERSON> said researchers concluded that older patients with existing cognitive impairment should not undergo the operation until further study. They also hope patients who did improve during the follow-up period may still benefit from the transplant. None of the four patients' showing improvements was cured, <PERSON> Tulipan </PERSON> said. `` It's not as if their shaking has stopped or any of their other symptoms have been cured,'' he said. `` It's just that they are somewhat better.'' The neurology academy said the positive results from the transplants have been less dramatic than those originally reported by Mexican researchers, who first attempted the operation. They reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1987 that two patients who had undergone the procedure had shown impressive results.

 Runners and neighbors of the teens charged with beating and raping a jogger in Central Park prayed for the comatose victim as doctors studied discouraging results of tests on her brain. Prayer vigils were held Tuesday for the 28-year-old investment banker, who was ambushed by a gang of youths April 19, and a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said two of the eight suspects had been attacked in jail by other inmates. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brisco </PERSON>, 17, reported back and neck pain, and Kharey Wise, 16, complained of an injured thigh after a fight Monday night at the <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> adolescent center, said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON>. She said the incident began in a room where <PERSON> Brisco </PERSON> and Wise were watching television with other inmates. Both were put into a segregated area. Tenants of the a middle-income apartment complex where four of the eight suspects live held a noon prayer vigil Tuesday outside <LOCATION> Metropolitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the victim is a patient. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> convened another vigil at the hospital at 6:30 p.m. where a rabbi, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest and an Episcopal priest offered prayers for the victim's recovery and for an end to violence and racial discord. A crowd of 300 blacks, whites and Hispanics, many holding hands and with their heads bowed, stood in silence as the clergy spoke. About 100 joggers ran from the hospital to the park near 102nd Street where the attack had taken place. They were joined by another 100 joggers. After observing a minute of silence, several runners spoke about safety. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, head of the surgical intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said the victim was breathing well on her own after being taken off a ventilator Tuesday. But he said an electroencephalogram showed a `` disorganized pattern'' of brain waves, indicating `` no coordination between different parts of the brain.'' `` As a prognostic sign, this is not very happy,'' he said.

 Syrian gunners blasted the Christian enclave's coastline with sporadic artillery and rocket fire today as the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> began talks on ways to halt <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war Police said the bombardment aimed to keep closed the only escape route for about 1 million Christians trapped in the enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. There were no reports of casualties in the shelling that targeted a 10-mile coastal stretch between <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos. By police count, at least 272 people have been killed and 991 wounded since the current fighting broke out March 8. Army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mostly Christian troops are pitted against an alliance of Syrian forces and <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militiamen. Two Cypriot-flagged ferry boats survived shelling by Syrian and Druse fighters over the the past five weeks to evacuate more than 13,000 Christians from the port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>. But sailings by the <PERSON> Larnaca </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and the Baroness M were suspended Monday by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> so that a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy tanker could unload 6,000 tons of fuel needed to reactivate power plants. Power was restored in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Tuesday for two hours a day, ending a 10-day blackout caused by lack of fuel at the main power plants in Christian and Moslem areas of the divided capital. Shipping officials in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> said it was not known when ferry service to <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> would be resumed. An Arab League mediation committee began discussions Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> on a peace plan for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that would include sending a multi-nation observer force of at least 200 Arab officers to monitor a cease-fire. According to Kuwaiti Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, head of the committee, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament would then elect a new president who would form a national unity government committed to political reform. The plan was to be presented today to an emergency foreign ministers' session of the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> at its <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> headquarters. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament failed to elect a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> before his 6-year term ended last September. Minutes before he stepped down, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> like himself, as head of an interim military cabinet to rule pending election of a new head of state. But Moslems and leftists rejected the appointment and pledged allegiance to the mostly Moslem cabinet of Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem who governed under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. The rival Cabinets' struggle for power has split the army and threatens to formalize <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s de facto partition into sectarian cantons. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has approved sending an Arab observer force `` as a first step'' toward ending the fighting, but stressed that `` the ultimate objective ... remains ending the Syrian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of Lebanese territory.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupies a strip of territory in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a buffer against cross-border attacks by Palestinian guerrillas. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains 40,000 troops in Moslem areas of northern, eastern and central <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as well as west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Shiite Moslem militia leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, a major Syrian ally, rejected the proposal for an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> observer force, saying `` We need them to help us politically ... We do n't need more armies.'' His statements were seen as a proxy rejection of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> plan by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which considers <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> its own backyard.

 The espionage case against an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent whose romance with a Soviet spy led to his imprisonment on two life terms will be pursued, the prosecutor said after a court reversed the conviction. `` We may re-appeal and we have other means,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said, apparently referring to requests for appeals court rehearing or <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review. `` If those fail, we will retry the case.'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, who headed the prosecution in the case, said he would weigh his options after reading Tuesday's decision by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturning <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s conviction. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, whose 1986 conviction for spying rested heavily on the results of his lie detector test, was granted a new trial after the court said such evidence should not have been allowed. He is the only <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent ever convicted of spying. The court said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> wrongly allowed prosecution witnesses to relate the questions <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was asked by a polygraph examiner, the answers he gave, and the examiner's conclusion that he was probably lying <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a 20-year <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> veteran, was charged with furnishing a classified document to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in return for a promise of $ 65,000 in cash and gold. He was sentenced to two life terms plus 50 years in prison. His attorney, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, said he was pleased by Tuesday's decision but that the victory comes a little late for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> `` We would be more pleased if we did n't have to wait almost five years for a fair trial with a client in custody,'' referring to the time <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has spent behind bars since his arrest. Another defense lawyer, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, said they would seek to have <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> released on bail pending a new trial. He said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is in the federal prison in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` The ruling that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> did not have a fair trial should come as no surprise to any fair and impartial observer of the <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> proceedings,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. `` The prosecution brought to this case an end-justifies-the-means mentality that I have never before witnessed in a court of law.'' The polygraph evidence bolstered the credibility of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s later admissions of wrongdoing, `` the heart of the prosecution's case,'' said Judge <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> in the 3-0 The court, like most others in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has consistently refused to allow lie-detector results as evidence of truthfulness because of doubts about the device's reliability. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> had made other errors, including allowing testimony by a government witness identified as an expert on Soviet recruiting methods to be used to attack <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s character <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was convicted in June 1986 of passing secrets to the Soviets through his lover, <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikova </PERSON>, a Soviet immigrant whom he had met in 1984. She and her husband, <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was charged with furnishing a classified document that sets forth annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence needs to his lover for delivery to the Soviet consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in August 1984. He claimed to be playing along with the Soviets in an unauthorized attempt to infiltrate their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy network.

 At least 38 people were killed and 37 wounded today in fighting between groups involved in black market activities along the Cambodian border, a Western aid official said. `` There was a big ambush on the trading route close to <LOCATION> Ta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phraya </LOCATION>,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` So far we have 38 people dead.'' He said 37 people were wounded, 10 seriously, in the fighting, which began about 1 p.m. They were taken to the hospital at the <LOCATION> Khao-I-Dang </LOCATION> refugee camp run by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The aid official said the dead included Thais but that most were Cambodians. He had no other details. Ta <LOCATION> Phraya </LOCATION> district is in the province of <LOCATION> Prachinburi </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and about 50 miles north of the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Aranyaprathet </LOCATION>. Black market trading and clashes over it are rife along the Thai-Cambodian border. The trading involves Thais as well as Cambodian guerrillas and refugees in guerrilla-run camps along the frontier. Also today, gunners continued attacks on Cambodian refugee camps in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, hitting the Site 2 camp with heavy shells that seriously injured four refugees, the Western official said. The injured were taken to the <LOCATION> Khao-I-Dang </LOCATION> hospital, he said. Site 2, with about 180,000 people, is the largest U.N.-aided Cambodian refugee camp in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Its outer perimeter is only a half-mile from the Cambodian border. Site 2 is controlled by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> The front is one of three guerrilla groups fighting Vietnamese forces and troops of the Cambodian government <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed after invading 10 years ago. It was not clear who fired the shells, which forced evacuation of all but the most essential Western aid workers. The refugees were not evacuated. In the past, shellings along the border escalated as the two sides maneuvered in advance of diplomatic events. <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> is to hold talks in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> next week with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of the pro-Vietnamese government.

 Students said today that government threats to suppress the largest student movement in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s history have only increased their resolve to make the country's leaders embrace democratic reforms. Student leaders said a class boycott that began Monday has spread to 41 universities and colleges around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, involving more than 70,000 students. At least four more schools joined the protest today, they said. Two protest leaders said students were ready to stage street demonstrations again as they did when they began their campaign 10 days ago. Chinese leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> on Tuesday ordered authorities to crack down on the protest, said a journalist at the People's Daily, the voice of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The peasants support us, the workers support us, the army supports us, so why should we be bothered by students,'' the journalist quoted the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as saying. His remarks prompted the People's Daily to publish a harsh editorial that called the student movement `` a planned conspiracy'' aimed at overthrowing the government. The editorial said further protests would be forbidden. The country's major newspapers and radio stations carried the editorial, and millions of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members met to discuss it and to prepare for the crackdown. More than 1,000 party members met in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and `` resolutely condemned the illegal student activities,'' said the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> city television news. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily, meanwhile, published an order from the city government telling students to disband their `` illegal'' unions. Most of the unions were formed last week after students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> voted down the official student organizations, which are set up by university officials. About 10,000 troops from the 38th <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a special force for suppressing civic disturbances, have taken up positions in buildings near university campuses, students and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources said. Student leaders pledged to defy the government and said they were ready to go back to the streets to protest if the government does not heed their demands for negotiations. `` If the government does not agree to a dialogue we will march in the streets,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student leader <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> at a meeting attended by 2,000 students at the Political Science and <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is our right. We will take the movement to the people.'' Since early last week, tens of thousands of students have been agitating for fundamental changes in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political system, including a free press and publication of the financial records of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders. They have also called for the resignations of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and of Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. `` We will only develop into a strong country when we respect human rights and allow the people more freedom,'' said one student at <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've had an emperor for too long, what we need is a president.'' Students at several universities said they were outraged by the editorial and accused the state-run press of distorting facts. `` The editorial is rubbish, it is filled with lies and it insults the students,'' <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, a student leader from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, told the crowd at the Political Science and <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The editorial accused the students of trying to overthrow the government and insinuated their movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was connected to violence last week in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, two provincial capitals. Last week, crowds of youths entered the ranks of protesting students and went on rampages in <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, looting stores, burning automobiles and buildings and beating policemen. The disturbances received prominent play in the Chinese press as the government sought to associate them with the largely peaceful protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The media has remained largely silent about protests Friday and Saturday in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> when more than 150,000 students and their supporters spent the night at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to call for democracy and commemorate the death of ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. Hu, a relatively liberal politician, was purged in 1987 for not cracking down hard enough on pro-democracy protests. The peaceful protest was one of the largest in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history and to date the clearest rejection by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s youth of the system

 An aide who served Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> for 31 years and handled scandal-tainted donations that helped sink <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s career committed suicide today. Police said <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, 58, who had served <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> since 1958, was found dead at his apartment in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He had slashed a wrist and an ankle with a razor and hanged himself, they said, and he left notes to his wife and several other people, including the prime minister. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> appeared shocked by the death. He told reporters he had not seen <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s note but thought it was possible the suicide was linked to the long-running Recruit scandal. `` I strongly regret -LRB- his action -RRB-. We walked side by side for over 30 years,'' said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who announced Tuesday he would resign soon to take responsibility for his and his party's involvement in the scandal <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s name, rather than <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s, appeared on loans and share dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that now are under suspicion both for political ethics and bribery. The company, an information services conglomerate, is accused of trying to buy influence with politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives. Prosecutors had questioned <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> several times. So far, 14 people face charges in the Recruit scandal but none of them is a politician or political aide like <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>. Last weekend, news reports said <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had accepted a $ 384,000 loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was campaigning to succeed <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> as prime minister. The money, which was paid back, was said to have been used in the campaign. The revelation of the loan embarrassed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> because he did not include it in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on April 11, when he said he had received more than $ 1 million in legal political donations from Recruit. The loan forced him to change his account of his involvement with the controversial company, and two days later <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his decision to resign. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> did not blame <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> in his departure statement, but news reports Monday said he had not known of the loan at the time he spoke to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> because his aide had not informed him of it until Saturday. In 1976, a driver who had carried bribery cash committed suicide after the emergence of the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> scandal that led to former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>'s conviction of bribery. Meanwhile, political factions in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were consulting about a successor to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who said he would not leave office until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passes the 1989 budget, likely some time next month. The most frequently mentioned candidate was <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75, a former foreign minister, who has appeared reluctant to take up the post at a time of political crisis. He said Tuesday the post should go to a younger person. The <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today that <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> was the choice agreed upon at meetings late Tuesday between <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and other party leaders. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said a majority of governing party members judged <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> as the only appropriate candidate because he is untainted by the scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is accused of seeking influence and favors by selling prelisted shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, through <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> and a relative, was a recipient of such shares, which skyrocketed in value after they went on sale to the public in late 1986. Profits from selling the shares reportedly went into political funds _ not only <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s, but <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s and those of other top leaders of the Liberal Democrats. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> received 2,000 of the shares, which yielded a profit of about $ 30,000. The wide swath of Recruit's donations, loans and share transactions cut through the political leadership have made it difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to find a replacement for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s age and health _ he is a diabetic _ make most observers consider him an interim choice who would serve for a few months while the party chooses a longer-term leader. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> becomes prime minster because of the party's big majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Rioting Between Mauritanians and Senegalese Leaves At Least 26 Dead</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Widespread rioting that began over a land dispute between <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> has left at least 26 people dead and 675 injured, hospital sources said today. The sources said they only knew about casualties taken to the main public hospital of <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION>, the Mauritanian capital. Violence also has occurred in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s capital, and in many other cities and towns in the two neighborhing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries. But there has been no reliable word on the number of casualties outside <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, Mauritanian officials began airlifting their countrymen out of <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> to avoid further violence. The hospital sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had no breakdown of how many of the dead and injured were Senegalese and how many Mauritanian. They said 20 of the injured were in serious condition. Violence has been spreading for two weeks since a border incident set off rising tensions over competing claims by Senegalese and Mauritanians to farm areas along the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms the border between the two nations. The streets of <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> were calm today. On Tuesday, police rushed through the streets of the sand-blown capital of 500,000 people and broke up crowds who roamed the poor quarters and occasionally surged onto the city's main streets to attack Senegalese and sometimes wreck or burn shops. An 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew remained in effect in <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nouadihbou </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauriania </LOCATION>'s main port. In <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, 375 miles to the south, Mauritanian Ambassador <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamal </PERSON> said 100 Mauritanian men and women had been airlifted out of the city Tuesday. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Mauritanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thousands more Mauritanians had taken refuge at the main mosque in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>. Anti-Mauritanian violence was not quelled in the Senegalese capital until 4 a.m. Tuesday after the army was called out and police fired tear gas. Both countries have reinforced their troops along the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as tensions mounted over the land dispute. Both nations have tried to calm tensions since Mauritanian soldiers allegedly killed two Senegalese farmers in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Diawara </PERSON> border village April 9 At least two people have died in violence in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> since then. Sporadic violence against Mauritanian shopkeepers in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> and Senegalese in <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> grew into widespread fighting on Sunday. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> straddles <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> north and black <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of its 2 million people are Moors of Arab-Berber extraction. The rest are black, mostly from the southern river region. Nearly all of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s 7 million people are black. The dispute concerns the right of Senegalese to farm on a <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> island. Even before the colonial period, the black Toucouleur people farmed both sides of the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. After both countries became independent from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960, Senegalese Toucouleur continued to farm the Mauritanian side they had considered their own for generations. Moors to the north, traditionally nomadic herders, did not farm. But the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up new farmland and spurred Mauritanian interest in agriculture. All along the border, Senegalese are being forced off the land.

 A wary state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> has endorsed a 10-year plan for <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to run the school system in impoverished <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>. The board's 7-4 vote Tuesday followed hours of passionate argument. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> officials and parents hailed <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> as the city's rescuer; teachers and Hispanic groups protested that the plan runs roughshod over constitutional rights In giving its approval, the board attached strings to make <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> more accountable to the public. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> is a down-at-the-heels city of 26,000 north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with a large proportion of immigrants and the elderly. Teacher salaries are low, as are test scores, and the high school dropout rate of 17 percent is among the state's highest. The takeover plan, which calls for <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> to pump in millions of dollars in donations and the know-how of its faculty and students, is subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, but that is considered virtually certain. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> represents a hope, a dream for us,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> pleaded during the board meeting here. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is our salvation,'' said Parent-Teacher Association leader <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Hispanic Affairs complained that BU and city officials ignored requests for more information and a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> translation of the plan. Others raised fears that <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> would do away with bilingual education in the school system, where about half the 3,300 students come from homes of Hispanic origin. Teachers unions are fighting the plan in court as unconstitutional. In its action Tuesday, the board said the Legislature should make BU hold open meetings and make records available to the public. If <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> rejects this, the board said, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> should make the legislation expire in two years. Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his opinion of the plan `` depends on the terms and conditions.''

<TEXT>
 The isolated mountain home of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON> had electricity this morning for the first time in his 69 years, three months after volunteers began negotiating to get a power company to bend its rules. `` It's somethin,' ai n't it?'' <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON> said after the power came on Tuesday afternoon. <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON> lives in a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> mountain cove 200 yards from the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> line. The only nearby utility, <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, has a policy against selling electricity across state lines. But it agreed last month to route the sale through a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> electric cooperative. The volunteers who negotiated the arrangement celebrated with <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON> by crowding into the cabin they had built for him and switching on all the lights, the donated television and the donated refrigerator at the same time.

 The chairman and ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today gave <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> high marks for crafting cuts in the Pentagon budget, but expressed concerns about some of the specific reductions. Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., commented a day after <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> outlined planned reductions, delays and cuts totaling $ 10 billion before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> The savings were required to meet the fiscal 1990 budget level of $ 295.6 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed upon by the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped up to the plate and made some tough decisions here under very rough circumstances,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' But, he said, he is `` very concerned'' about the decision to scrap the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey, a battlefield aircraft designed to take off like a helicopter but fly like an airplane. `` That has very strong implications for future commercial aviation as well as for the military,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. The Pentagon had hoped to spend $ 25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys, including $ 1.3 billion in 1990. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> called the decision to drop it his most difficult. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, interviewed with <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, gave <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> `` very high marks'' and added, `` I think we're going to follow the <LOCATION> Bush-Cheney </LOCATION> plan very closely.'' However, <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, a former secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, said he is concerned about heavy cuts falling on that service. `` I'm concerned about our deployments beyond the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where our young men in many instances and now women aboard ship have to be gone for six and seven months, and the stress that puts on families,'' he said. If the strategic assessment <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the first week in May `` tells us we can cut back on some of those deployments abroad and the time, then I think the impact is somewhat less severe,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cuts outlined by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> included retiring the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, one of the last two World War II-era aircraft carriers; transferring to the reserves 10 frigates; retiring seven destroyers; canceling production of the F-14D fighter, and scrubbing the purchase of the last <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-class </LOCATION> nuclear attack submarine. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also got a generally approving reaction from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during his day-long presentation Tuesday. `` Now there's much in what you presented that I do n't like, some of which I disagree with, but I'm willing to buy it as a package,'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the committee, told <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. Among <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s proposals were a reduction for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in active-duty strength of more than 2.1 million by 16,800 men and women. The defense secretary left intact a proposed 3.6 percent pay hike for those in the military. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, who has been on the job just 39 days, said the process `` for the ultimate Republican hawk,'' was extremely difficult, but he knew of no other way to cut the budget. Among the big-ticket items facing major changes were: _ `` Star Wars,'' the program pushed by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to develop lasers and other exotic weapons to shoot down enemy nuclear missiles, will lose $ 1 billion from its proposal 1990 budget, giving it a new total of $ 4.6 billion. _ The B-2 stealth bomber will have its production pushed back a year to 1993 Almost $ 4.1 billion is being cut from the fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the radar-evading plane. Recent estimates of $ 500 million per plane make it the most expensive in history. _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plane </ORGANIZATION>, a joint project with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, will be scaled back drastically The high-speed transport could fly around the world in just hours. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> decided to cut the project's fiscal 1990 budget by two-thirds, from $ 300 million to $ 100 million _ The Midgetman nuclear missile, a single-warhead missile that would be small enough to be carried and fired from a truck launcher, will be held to $ 100 million despite President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to develop the missile in addition to a rail-based version of the MX nuclear Spending for the MX in fiscal 1990 would total $ 1.2 billion, with another $ 2.2 billion earmarked for fiscal 1991. Democrats and Republicans expressed their opposition to the elimination of the V-22 Osprey, arguing that the technology associated with the program makes it an aircraft whose time has come. Rep. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he `` would n't be surprised if 10 years from now we were buying the technology from someone else,'' and Rep. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., asked <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to provide the documentation he used in deciding to kill the Osprey `` You're going to hear much more about it,'' <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> said. `` This program has strong support in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' But <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> stood by his decision, reminding <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed on the total defense budget and in light of the program's lack of affordability, he had no other choice. `` I urge you to work your wiles and come out with another $ 27 billion,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told the panel after at least five lawmakers had criticized the decision. Earlier, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> had cautioned the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary against weakening his stand. `` If you do n't hang tough and if you let them start opening the package and the whole thing comes unglued, we're going to continue to have the fights in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the admininstration across the whole myriad of weapons systems and we really have n't accomplished much,'' he said

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has dropped a quarter of the most senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s top policy-making body and installed his own men and women. At a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting Tuesday, the Soviet president remolded the body's membership in a maneuver expected to make it easier for him to wage his campaign for reform. Seventy-four of the committee's 301 full members retired, including former President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and many other holdovers from pre-Gorbachev days, and 24 people were promoted to full membership. The committee also retired 24 of its non-voting members and 12 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which handles party finances. Party ideology chief <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told a news conference that all had volunteered to step down. The military lost a substantial voice in the Central Committee: at least nine senior officers were dropped and just one officer was promoted from candidate status to full membership. The changes left the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with 251 full members, party personnel chief <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> told the news conference. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told reporters the number of committee members might go up or down later. The next opportunity to add voting members would be at the party congress in 1991, but non-voting members could be added at any <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. While the Politburo is the party and Soviet society's ruling body, it is the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in its several meetings a year that sets policy goals. The committee also is empowered to make changes in the Politburo, and a stronger hand in its affairs could make it easier for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to bring supporters into the ruling body. The retiring officials issued a joint request that referred to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for perestroika, or restructuring: `` It is essential for us, in the interest of the common cause, to give up -LRB- our -RRB- powers.'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> remarked, `` This is a serious and important milestone in our course, perestroika, which shows that our party is realistically assessing its own work and is quite critical about its own activities.'' The resignations followed the first contested, nationwide elections in 70 years of Communist rule on March 26. Dozens of top party and government officials, including more than 30 regional party chairmen, were defeated. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said 83 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had lost the government and party jobs that entitled them to committee membership. Officially, they lost their jobs because of poor health or age, but some clearly fell from political favor. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said a few of the 83 were too ill to sign their resignations. Western observers call such inactive officials `` dead souls'' and say they can be a conservative force slowing reforms. The term was borrowed from <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogol </PERSON>'s 1842 novel `` Dead Souls.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has complained that opposition to his social and economic reform program extends all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has included many officials who were seated long before he became party leader in March 1985. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the 58-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief praised the retirees for working hard for perestroika. `` Many of us had to give up our habits and stereotypes of thinking. And still, at this time of utmost importance for the development of our society, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rose to the occasion,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. But in remarks carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, he added, `` The situation has changed considerably, comrades. Vast changes have taken place over this period also in state bodies, and this required personnel changes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the retirees included <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who retired as president last fall; former <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> and former non-voting Politburo member <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON>. Also dropped were <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON>, who was retired as defense minister in 1987 after West German teen-ager <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> flew a plane onto Red Square, and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyamran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON>, who lost their jobs as first secretary of the Armenian and <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> parties respectively in ethnic unrest last May. Among those promoted were <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and thought to be a close <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> supporter, and the ambassador to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvitsinsky </PERSON>, an arms control expert who negotiated on space weapons with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the study marks a resumption of collaboration in cancer research that began in 1972 but ended when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> army entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979. `` It is one more sign that the Cold War is finally behind us,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat, whose son <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was treated for bone cancer at Dana-Farber. American researchers have had difficulty enrolling large numbers of patients in clinical trials, which sometimes involve placebos and side effects. Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said last year that doctors' reluctance to put patients in drug comparison studies was a `` national disgrace'' that slowed the search for better treatments. <PERSON> Frei </PERSON> said the goal of the collaboration is to share expertise. `` We're not using them -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- in any sense,'' he said. `` They will be the primary beneficiaries of both the technology and the treatments.'' <PERSON> Hallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Dana-Farber institute, said the project was initiated by the Soviets, who are eager to receive new technology and drugs from American companies. `` What the Soviet side is providing, the advantage of the Soviet health care system, is that it is very centralized, which allows them to get just the right patients from all over the country and bring them to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for these studies,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Aho </PERSON>, another spokeswoman for the institute. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the study may involve exchanging some patients between the countries. Besides the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the American hospitals participating in the study are the <ORGANIZATION> Jonsson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Roswell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, N.Y.

 The countdown for Friday's launch of Atlantis with the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venus </ORGANIZATION> probe progressed in `` squeaky clean'' fashion today, and some work was ahead of schedule, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> test director reported. `` We have no significant open items and we're on schedule,'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofge </PERSON> said. The countdown, which started Tuesday, continued toward a liftoff at 2:24 p.m. Friday. Today's major task was the loading of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant aboard the space shuttle's power-producing fuel cells Air Force Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Strange </PERSON>, shuttle meteorologist, said the only weather concern remained the possibility of strong crosswinds of about 17 mph that could be dangerous if Atlantis had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad. Otherwise, he said, the forecast was for clear skies and temperature of 87 degrees. Six hours after launch, astronauts <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON> are to release the 7,600-pound <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe and a rocket is to propel it on a 468-day journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to reach its destination in August 1990, swooping into orbit around <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> to begin a 243-day period during which it is to map up to 90 percent of the cloud-shrouded planet's surface with the probe's high resolution radar system. After releasing <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, the astronauts will conduct experiments for four days, then return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` We're not really in charge of the deep space probe,'' Commander <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said Tuesday after he and his four crew members arrived from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` We're fortunate enough to be part of the team that gets to send it up there. We're going to give it a little boost along the way. Then the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> team will make sure that it gets to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and does its job. ... We're mighty proud to be part of it.'' The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialists Cleave, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>. The mission costs $ 550 million and the radar images could reveal much about the history of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and the evolution of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said it is hoped the computer-enhanced images will answer `` a major question of why <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> evolved so differently even through at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical.''

 Students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> will be required to take ethnic study courses beginning in 1991. Students who packed the upper galleries of an auditorium cheered Tuesday when the faculty approved 227-194 a resolution requiring every student take a course on race, culture and ethnicity to earn a bachelor's degree. Such courses must draw from three of five major American cultural groups: African Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, Hispanics and European Americans. An important change from the original proposal was the addition of European Americans, said <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Israels </PERSON>, student body vice president of academic affairs. `` There were a lot of people, many Jews, for instance, who did n't like their culture being left out,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Opposition leaders today urged radical students and workers to halt their protests and said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could be plunged into political chaos if they do n't. Police clashed with protesters in two cities. The leaders of the three main opposition parties also accused President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government of fomenting unrest with harsh crackdowns on opponents and by failing to carry out promised democratic reforms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>, in a statement aimed at radical students and workers, said: `` We warn against an expansion of leftist forces trying to overthrow our democratic system through violent revolution.'' About 5,000 striking workers clashed with riot police for a third day in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>, about 180 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Workers hurled firebombs and rocks at police and set fire to drums of oil to hold back charging troopers. In another clash, about 600 radical students shouting `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police at <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police used multiple tear gas launchers to combat the students. Police said there were injuries in both cities, but they gave no details. The government issued a warning today against a major rally that radical workers and students planned Monday to mark the May Day holiday. The government said police would block the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> rally. Organizers vowed to defy the warning and said they expected 100,000 people to attend. In another development, student leaders announced plans for a march Friday to the North Korean border for talks with communist students on reuniting the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Police issued orders banning the march and a planned rally Sunday in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by labor groups. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's main dissident alliance, said the police actions were an `` illegal abuse of power'' and vowed to go ahead with demonstrations. The students and dissidents lack popular support because of their violence and extreme views and are not seen as a serious threat to the government. But government leaders say a wave of strikes for better pay are damaging the economy and could lead to serious political unrest. The <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today that strikes this year had so far cost about $ 3.5 billion in lost production, including nearly $ 900 million in exports. Two of the nation's three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and Kia, have virtually halted production because of strikes at companies making components, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. The opposition leaders, known as the three Kims, said they would try to form a new opposition alliance and demanded the government keep its promise to punish former officials of the authoritarian regime of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> went into rural exile last November after apologizing to the nation for corruption and rights abuses under his rule, but opposition parties are demanding top <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> lieutenants also be prosecuted for wrongdoings. The three <PERSON> Kims </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> must keep an election promise to hold a referendum. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> called off such a vote in March, saying it would divide the nation. The three opposition leaders have formed alliances in the past, but they are deeply divided and have often clashed. The last opposition alliance collapsed earlier this year in a dispute over whether the government should hold <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s promised referendum. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, won elections in December 1987 after the three Kims all ran and split the opposition vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> succeeded his former ally, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who took power with military backing in 1980.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> heard Australian grievances today about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm subsidies and told Prime Minister ob <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> that he must accept the `` political reality,'' officials said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> launched into talks with <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> soon after he and his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> is arrival on the first leg of a four-nation tour of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the Far East. Australian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, briefing reporters, described the private 90-minute meeting as particularly warm and said the overriding theme of the talks was that Australian-U.S. relations are in `` excellent shape.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is to spend five days in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> representing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at this year's celebration of Australian-American Friendship Week. Defense issues had been expected to overshadow the talks following <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s announcement Tuesday that he is considering formally ending his country's participation in the <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> military alliance Instead, bilateral economic issues dominated, with <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> complaining about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm subsidies that he said hurt Australian wheat exports. `` There were lengthy discussions on trade,'' said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, according to the officials, explained it was not the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intention to `` deliberately target <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'' with its Export Enhancement Program, which is designed to counter the trade strategy of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. They said <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> provided the vice president with analytical and statistical evidence about how <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> was suffering from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade policies and that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took note of the concerns. While both leaders agreed on the need for free trade, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> `` that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm bill is a political reality,'' the sources said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> agreed that Australian-U.S. relations had `` never been in better shape'' and that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> remains a steadfast ally. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said he viewed the viewed the ANZUS defense pact as dead because of continuing restrictions in its relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which virtually cut off relations because of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s refusal to accept port visits by nuclear-capable ships. But <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said it was impossible to view <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s threat further because `` at this stage it is only hypothetical,'' one official reported. En route here, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made a two-hour stop in sun-drenched <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Somoa </LOCATION>, time enough to convince him he liked it and the `` happy campers'' who live there. `` Maybe I'll just stay for a few days,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the islanders who honored him at a native ceremony and showered him with gifts. As he spoke, a Samoan beauty queen in a sarong dress shielded him from the hot sun with an umbrella. In exchange for the gracious reception, the vice president proclaimed Tuesday a public holiday for the roughly 38,000 people here. `` I have the power to declare this a holiday ... you can have the rest of the day off,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of about 2,000 gathered under palm trees at Tafuna International Airport. Townspeople greeted him with sweet-smelling flower leis and a brass band. Later, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters the holiday had been the idea of Gov. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Colema </PERSON>. The relaxation in <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION> came in sharp contrast to the grueling pace <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had kept for the previous 32 hours. In that time, he delivered a speech in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, met with former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, attended a security briefing in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and played basketball at 3 a.m. at <ORGANIZATION> Hickam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> there. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> proclaimed tropical <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> `` a delightful change of pace.'' `` You all look like happy campers to me,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the first vice president to visit the territory since <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> came to the outpost 11 years ago. `` Happy campers you are, happy campers you have been and as far as I'm concerned, happy campers you will always be.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stressed to the islanders the importance of education as a way of opening opportunities. School children waving miniature <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags lined the narrow road that brought the <LOCATION> Quayles </LOCATION> to Nu'uli village, a cluster of houses with corrugated iron roofs and open sides. At a traditional ceremony, the <ORGANIZATION> Quayles </ORGANIZATION> sat on grass mats under a thatched-roof lodge belonging to the village chief. The Quayles were presented with 30 cases of canned wahoo tuna, a decorated mat, wooden jewelry for Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, several wooden bowls and a basket purse. The Quayles also were to visit <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. After returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> they intended to tour <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> to monitor cleanup efforts from the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

 When <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Schranke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building to begin his 19-hour wait to witness an argument on abortion rights, police officers told him he was nine hours early. `` I got here at 3 p.m. yesterday,'' <PERSON> Schranke </PERSON> told a reporter this morning. `` The police did not start giving out numbers for courtroom seats until midnight but we arranged our own numbering system.'' At midnight, Schranke, a transportation engineering student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, was given No. 1. Today's hour-long argument, scheduled from 10 to 11 a.m. EST, focuses on abortion regulations in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. But state officials and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are urging the court to use the case to reverse or curtail its landmark 1973 ruling that women have a constitutional right to abortion. Twenty-four people were arrested in protests outside the court this morning, a court spokesman said. All were charged with unlawful entry for crossing police lines, a misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail and $ 100 fine. <PERSON> Schranke </PERSON> said he opposes the earlier ruling. `` I believe that God is the creator and man has no right to take a life <PERSON> God </PERSON> has created,'' he said. `` The baby has to have the choice.'' <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> sophomores <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Jordy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strafford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, were among the earliest arrivals. <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> described himself as a strong supporter of abortion rights. `` If the constitutional right to abortion were taken away it would have a devastating impact on the country,'' he said. `` American individual rights are at a crossroads.'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he was `` neutral'' on the abortion issue and `` trying to learn more about it.'' `` Both sides are very articulate in communicating their views,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said, adding that his 16-hour wait in line had proved an educational experience. <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, lawyer, said she had come to the court `` just because this is part of history.'' `` I think that's why a lot of people are here,'' she said. `` To see the court in action and to witness history in the making.'' Between 150 and 200 members of the public usually can be seated in the imposing courtroom on a first-come, first-served basis. But because the justices and other court officials had reserved an usually high number of seats for friends and family members, only 40 to 50 seats were available for the general public, court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said.

 Soldiers searching for the killers of an American colonel fired at a car driven by a Roman Catholic priest and detained him for about two hours, military and church officials said today. The military, which did not charge the priest, accused him of visiting a safe house used by communist guerrillas. The guerrillas have claimed responsibility for killing the American, Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>. The priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Alforque </PERSON>, denied any links to <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s killers. Church and human rights groups denounced his detention as part of a campaign to silence religious leaders critical of military abuses. Alforque belongs to several religious organizations critical of alleged human rights abuses by the military and of the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was slain Friday on his way to work at the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Communist rebels said they killed him to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s counterinsurgency campaign. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Alforque </PERSON> was detained Tuesday night after visiting what the general called a suspected communist safe house near where <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> was slain. When police raided the house today looking for arms, it turned out to be the office of the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> BALAI </ORGANIZATION>. `` They did not find anything,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Arno </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanidad </PERSON> of the Free Legal Assistance Group. <ORGANIZATION> BALAI </ORGANIZATION> is an affiliate of the group. <PERSON> Sanidad </PERSON> said police detained a volunteer but released him without charge four hours later. <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said the priest, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superiors </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, was released to his superior after being detained for two hours. Asked if <PERSON> Alforque </PERSON>'s detention was connected to the <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> investigation, <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> replied: `` That is the principal objective in the operation.'' <PERSON> Alforque </PERSON> said he visited the offices of <ORGANIZATION> BALAI </ORGANIZATION> to pick up his sister, <PERSON> Mariven </PERSON>, who works there. After finding she had left, he drove toward his seminary-residence when he noticed he was being followed by several cars of armed men in civilian clothes. `` When I saw them, I got scared,'' he said. `` They fired their guns and it hit my car.

 More than 80 Palestinian leaders from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the occupied lands today rejected the prime minister's election plan and demanded an international conference to resolve the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. `` We believe real peace in the region can not be achieved by projects that are calculated to appeal to the media, to end the -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- uprising and to win time,'' the leaders said in a statement. It was the first formal response from local Palestinians to the peace proposal Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> outlined in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier this month. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed elections be held in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to select Palestinians who would hold talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on an interim solution for the troubled region. After two years, discussions would begin toward a permanent solution. The plan, as outlined by the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> government, rules out any participation by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terrorist organization. In their statement, the Palestinian leaders called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` recognize the necessity of negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> within the framework of an international conference.'' It called the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.'' The statement said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan was `` an attempt to divide our people into ` inside' and ` outside' Palestinians.'' It said the signers' `` rejection of the election proposal does not indicate a rejection of elections as a democratic process but is the rejection of a project which ignores the essense of the conflict. `` This isolated occurrence of elections does not illustrate how it will lead to the end of the occupation and to Palestinian national independence.'' It urged that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> be given authority to administer the occupied territories during a transitional period to Palestinian statehood. The statement, distributed in Arabic and English, was signed by 83 prominent Palestinians, many known to favor the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s top spokesmen could not be reached for comment because of the Passover holiday. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said he realizes the Palestinians want a final solution, not an interim one, but that `` the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> thinking is if we start from the end, we wo n't have a beginning. This is the idea behind the step-by-step approach.'' Chief among them was <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> of Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, who recently returned from meetings with Egyptian officials in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> is considered the chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in the occupied lands. He has been held in jail without being charged for most of the 16-month Palestinian uprising, and also has met with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials on their peace plans for the territories. During the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the territories, 450 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed. Others who signed the document included university professor <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Haidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Shafi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baramki </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Beir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; Mayor <PERSON> Hilme </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanoun </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ranteesi </PERSON>, an Anglican priest from <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has backed the idea of elections in the occupied lands and has called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to work out a way to hold such balloting. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> presented his plan that he believes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must end its occupation of the territories but that he does not favor the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. Late last year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reversed a longstanding policy and opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been a major proponent of an international conference, which also has the backing of major <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, including <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Today's statement said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` finds itself more internationally isolated than ever before _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been stripped of its main support and has been revealed as a terrorist state suppressing, with blood and force, a civilian population struggling with legitimate means for national independence.'' The Palestinian leaders put forward a four-point plan calling on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to: _ Recognize the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as a people with a right to a secure life and an independent state _ Recognize the necessity of negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> within the framework of an international conference _ Allow the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to administer the territories in the interim _ Allow the international conference to `` give suitable guarantees of security for all states in the region according to definite principles agreed upon by all the parties.

 A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official disputes evidence in the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial, saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government backed away from a plan approved by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to give <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> extra <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in return for supporting the Nicaraguan rebels. The comments Tuesday by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee came in response to disclosure of the plan at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. The jury in the trial returned to the courthouse this morning for its fifth day of deliberations. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> initialed a Feb. 19, 1985, memo prepared by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and introduced at his trial approving a plan to link more than $ 110 million in extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' support for the Contra rebels. That support consisted primarily of allowing the rebels to maintain base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned military aid to the Contras. The month after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved the plan, then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and told President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had directed expedited delivery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military items and other aid to the country, according to a 42-page admission introduced at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> did receive the additional assistance and continued to support the Contras. But <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, acting assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, maintains that the extra aid was n't conditioned on Contra support `` The ... plan was disapproved, at the objection of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, on the grounds that conditionality _ linkage between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance and any assistance to the resistance _ was contrary to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy,'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> offered no details on how the plan came to be scrapped. He was n't asked by the subcommittee about the fact that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had approved it. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> at one point mischaracterized the 42-page admission, saying that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, whose lawyers prepared the document, `` has linked a trip of the vice president ... to a secret plan that was never approved.'' In fact, the admission does not address whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, during his visit to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> the extra aid was contingent on Contra support. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly refused to discuss the contingent aid plan or his actions during the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> trip, saying it could prejudice <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial. The court admission was prepared by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers and the prosecution, in concert with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> referred to the admission as `` a fiction'' and said it was primarily the product of North and his lawyers. Some changes were made by the independent counsel prosecuting the North case. But administration officials were permitted only to screen it to excise classified information, he said. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said he was among the officials who screened it. The plan which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved included an emissary who would carry a signed copy of a letter by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urging support for the Contras, according to the Feb. 19, 1985, memo initialed by the president. The emissary was then to `` very privately explain our criteria for the expedited economic support, security assistance deliveries and enhanced <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> support,'' said the memo from national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. The document, marked `` memorandum for the president,'' was prepared by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and an <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> colleague, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON>, according to a notation at the bottom of the document. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> put his initials in two locations, including the line marked `` OK'' for the recommendation saying that `` you authorize us to proceed as outlined above.'' `` The whole proposed linkage that was included in -LRB- North's -RRB- plan was disapproved, was not made, there was no ` discreet emissary,''' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> maintained. Another document introduced at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial reflects opposition by <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>'s area of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, then headed by <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. A Feb. 15, 1985, memo from North to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> says that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' operation `` has clearly indicated that they do not desire to have an emissary, that there is no need to explain the ` conditionality.' A Feb. 25, 1985, memo from North to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> seems to suggest that the emissary idea was proceeding. It says that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s letter to <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> urging support for the Contras `` will be delivered by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s colleague on the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff. `` We seem to be well on the way toward an early release'' of the additional aid, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s memo continues. North is charged with 12 criminal counts including lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up the Iran-Contra affair, illegally converting travelers checks from a Contra leader to his personal use, and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Students Arrested While Protesting Defense Department Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A student protest that resulted in 52 arrests will not stop military research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, the chancellor says. Police in riot gear Tuesday arrested 29 students camped inside Memorial Hall on trespassing charges. Twenty-three others were arrested for lying in front of the police bus to prevent it from leaving, authorities said. Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> issued a statement telling the students that Pentagon-funded research will continue on the 25,000-student campus. `` The policy will not be negotiated with students,'' he said. `` Until faculty and trustees in deliberate process modify these policies, they remain policies governing faculty research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>.'' The occupation of the campus building began with about 35 students on Monday afternoon. By Tuesday evening, about 300 students stood outside, the chanting and looking on as the students inside the hall were arrested. <PERSON> Christobal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonifaz </PERSON>, an attorney for the arrested students, said they refused to give their names to police, identifying themselves as either `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' or `` <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said about 40 students left the building Tuesday morning after administrators told them they would be arrested after 5 p.m. Graduate students were told they could face suspension, and any teaching assistants arrested probably would lose their jobs, she said. The takeover was the second against military research at the campus in a week. Seven protesters were arrested April 19. All research at the university is non-classified and researchers must make their work public under university rules. About $ 11.6 million, or 22 percent of all grant money received at the university, came from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1988, according to the school. The local <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> contends that Army-funded anthrax bacterial research is dangerous to the town, which the school disputes.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 8 grafs new with Rep. Myers raising possibility of contempt
citations; picks up at pvs 7th graf, The ethics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, angered at being snubbed by key witnesses in the case of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, suggested today that the panel might cite the witnesses for contempt. `` There are a lot of options. A contempt citation is one,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, R-Ind., who returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from a fruitless trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with ethics committee Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` We're in good faith trying to do what has to be done,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said, relating how he and <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> had waited Tuesday to interview a group of five investors in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gas well that yielded little gas but did produce large profits for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s blind A half-hour after the group failed to appear, a hotel employee came to inform the investigators that the witnesses were n't coming. `` I do n't think that's proper treatment for anyone,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> told reporters. `` We thought we'd get this behind us. But if they do n't want to cooperate, they can slow us down, and they have. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the ethics committee would meet Thursday to discuss the status of the case, which has left <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s position as speaker in jeopardy. He said failure of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> witnesses to appear raised questions about why they did not want to testify. `` Maybe there's something more to that,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` I think we have to look at this -LRB- with -RRB- even more scrutiny. Why did n't they want to appear?'' In the capital, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s colleagues continued to focus on charges that he sold bulk quantities of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' to evade <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income. The speaker said he might consider giving the profits to charity if the ethics panel suggests it. The ethics panel issued its findings in the 10-month investigation last week, formally charging <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with 69 instances of violating House rules. The panel said he had improperly received $ 145,000 in gifts from a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> business partner with a direct interest in legislation, and had used bulk sales of a book he wrote to evade limits on outside income. The panel is considering whether there is `` clear and convincing'' proof of the 69 alleged violations and, if so, whether to recommend disciplinary action to the House. The committee left open one area of inquiry _ how <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s blind trust profited heavily from a one-day investment last May in the drilling venture at <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, near the Texas-Louisiana line. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s investment partnership with developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> invested $ 9,120 cash in the well on May 10, then sold the interest later that day for a $ 340,000 profit even though oil and gas flows at the time had dwindled. The well later was abandoned. The committee is studying `` the amount of profit over a few hours' time,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` It does n't look good.'' But in a letter to the committee, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> argued that the panel was `` overreaching'' in commanding the testimony of five people he represents: <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>; his son, M.D. -LRB- <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>; investors <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestridge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>'s bookkeeper. The ethics committee said it wanted to determine whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> knew about the well deal, which involved the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffes </ORGANIZATION>, a West German-owned firm and the blind trust established for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in 1987, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the ethics committee's special outside counsel. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> contends he was ignorant of the deal because it occurred within his blind trust. Brand, in the letter he released, argued that the drilling venture was outside the scope of the ethics committee's original resolution of inquiry voted last June 9. `` Serious legal questions are raised by the sheer overbreadth of these subpoenas,'' <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> wrote, adding that his clients were given just a week to prepare for their testimony. The development threw another procedural roadblock in the way of the case, which already was bogged down in negotiations between <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, and committee counsel <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> over conditions for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to appear before the panel for a personal defense. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., told reporters many of her Democratic colleagues have discussed the advisability of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> giving back any profits he made from the book deal, which is the most troubling charge to many of the speaker's colleagues `` We have all said that we thought that restitution made a lot of sense,'' she said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> could say, ` OK, I probably stretched it too far,' and donate the money to charity without admitting wrongdoing, she said. Asked about the suggestion, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` If that's what the committee wants me to do, of course I'd do it.'' But he defended the book sales, saying, `` I never consciously considered that ... buying books was payment for my making a speech.''

 Soldiers shot and killed two teen-agers and an 8-year-old boy and wounded 37 other Palestinians today in the occupied lands, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> officials said. Palestinians killed a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It was the sixth fatal attack in a week on an alleged collaborator and came after PLO-backed leaders of the uprising declared today `` a day of accounting for the collaborators.'' In clashes with Israeli troops, 8-year-old <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aniss </PERSON> was shot in the chest when soldiers opened fire in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. A 20-year-old man was shot in the right arm in the same incident, and the army clamped a curfew on the camp and the neighboring town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, the reports said. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 16-year-old <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> was killed when soldiers shot at stone-throwing youths in the <LOCATION> Sabra </LOCATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Officials at <PERSON> Ahli </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospitial </PERSON> said he was shot in the chest. Three other youths were reported shot in the head in <LOCATION> Sabra </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. A 17-year-old girl was reported killed in the Shati camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. She was identified as <PERSON> Ammal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, and officials at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said she died of a gunshot wound to the head. An army spokesman confirmed the death of the alleged collaborator. He said the army was checking the other reported deaths but was having trouble because in at least two cases, families immediately took the bodies for burial. The deaths brought to 451 the number of Palestinians killed in the 16-month revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Eighteen Israelis have died. The army confirmed 10 Palestinians were wounded. Arab reports said the 37 people wounded included a 2-year-old girl who was shot in the head with a plastic bullet during a clash between soldiers and stone-throwing youths in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Four other Palestinians were shot and wounded in the clash, Arab hospital officials said. The alleged collaborator killed today was identified as <PERSON> Fayek </PERSON> <PERSON> Erar </PERSON>, 40. Residents of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Atiya </PERSON> village said he was gunned down at his home there because he was accused of helping <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. To prevent violence during a general strike today, the army declared curfews on seven <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps and the <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, ordering more than 200,000 Palestinians to stay in their homes. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said curfews also were imposed on most areas of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of 79,000 where clashes have occurred for the past two days between Palestinians and Jews after Israeli cars or buses were stoned. The strike virtually shut down the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the Arab eastern sector of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Black smoke could be seen rising over <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as Palestinian youths blocked roads with burning tires. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, dozens of outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags fluttered from electricity lines, and graffiti painted in Islamic green across walls and shop doors urged stepping up the uprising. The Moslem fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> ordered today's strike in a leaflet calling for a shutdown of the occupied lands on the anniversary of the capture of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> by the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> in 630. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, but he fled the city when local leaders resisted his first preaching of Islam. Moslems throughout the world say their five daily prayers facing Mecca.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. April 25 The Flint -LRB- <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first 100 days: No, we have n't noticed an increase in the number of times the <ORGANIZATION> Pledge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allegiance </ORGANIZATION> is being recited _ even though the pledge was one of the biggest issues in last November's presidential election. But that, of course, ca n't be the standard by which we measure the first 100 days of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Neither can we use what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called, `` the vision thing.'' And nobody seems to have an accurate handle of how many thousands of points of light started shining since the White House changed occupants. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can be fairly judged on his handling of the economy, the war on drugs, environmental protection, foreign policy, government administration, and his pledge to transform <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into a kinder and gentler nation. In general, he's been doing a good job, a better job than we expected. If we were to peg a letter grade to his performance, it would be a C + But his progress has come slowly _ slower than a clock in a classroom on a beautiful morning in May.

 April 20 The Westerly -LRB- <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun on improving the educational system: Failure to improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> educational system could saddle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economy with `` enormous long-term costs,'' a congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said -LRB- April 18 -RRB-. The committee said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is falling behind in promoting literacy and job skills even though it already spends more money per student than any other country in the world. ... Other nations recognized long ago that their economic futures were closely linked to the education and training of their young people. ... There are many valid reasons to promote education but the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s reasoning provides a perspective we all understand _ dollars.

 April 21 The Item, <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, on the ban on handguns: Few public debates are as impassioned as the one revolving around the possession of firearms. ... The debate has long focused on handguns, but recent events have shifted that focus to imported assault weapons. The use of AK-47s in a number of horrific crimes lately, for instance, has led to a temporary ban on imported semi-automatic assault weapons. ... It is certainly a simple task for a criminal to obtain an AK-47, but to stop them from being imported is to deny a law-abiding citizen the right to acquire one. Perhaps. But let it not be forgotten that the assualt weapon is in fact a weapon. It was specifically designed for, and is almost always used for, killing people. To put it in the hands of sportsman does not endow it with anything more noble, and to compare it with a sportsman's fowling piece is absurd.

 April 25 The <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> -LRB- N.M. -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> ethics: It was fitting that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for tightening ethical standards in government was made public shortly before Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was accused of 69 violations of House rules. It was a reminder that while the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has focused so much attention of late on allegations of wrongdoing in the executive branch, the national legislature has a substantial factor of sleaze. In presenting his plan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appropriately made the point that the public finds it hard to understand why `` certain behavior is considered criminal when committed by an executive branch official'' but is `` perfectly legal when committed by someone in another branch of government.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` If <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is to be a level playing field, then every player should be treated the same.''

 April 20 The <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> -RRB- News on fusion: The continuing news about fusion is being pushed on the public at a furious rate. But while we wish them well, we'd like someone to come forward with a little glossary of terms so the rest of us can keep up with advancements. Such things as heavy water palladium electrodes, and helium-4 make some of us wish we had n't dozed during science class. For whatever it's worth, fusion might be something to get excited about; but the bottom line is that for most of us, the result is confusion. We ca n't wait for it to be invented; maybe then someone will explain to us what it really means.

Was it because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> insists on maintaining a needlessly dangerous and outdated weapons system? It is a question that deserves careful study. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> already has jumped to the defense of its battleships and its enormous 16-inch guns. ... This is not the time for that type of defensive thinking. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> should thoroughly examine the reasons for the explosion inside the World War II-vintage gun turret. Then, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> must realistically determine whether this is the best and safest technology available to its fighting men.

 April 21 The Daily World, <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on the USS Iowa explosion: The explosion that killed 47 men aboard the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was a tragic reminder of the risk that goes with military service, a risk often not fully appreciated by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public. ... The accident has revived some of the criticism expressed several years ago when the government reactivated four old World War II `` battlewagons.'' ... After the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion -LRB- April 19 -RRB-, one critic was prominently displayed on television complaining about the ship's `` old-fashioned ammunition, old-fashioned technology and old-fashioned wiring. Despite the criticism, the recommissioned battleships serve many military purposes. They have been outfitted with the latest communications and electronic warfare equipment and each has been equipped with deadly Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles. ... To suggest, as some have, that the battleships should now be re-mothballed is like saying that the frigate fleet should be scrapped because the USS Stark, while on patrol in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in 1987, suffered many casualties when it was hit and nearly sunk by a missile fired by an Iraqi warplane.

 April 22 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Tribune on foreign oil reliance: The spring surge in gasoline cost has boosted pump prices in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by up to 30 cents a gallon. ... Not surprisingly, the Alaskan oil spill coupled with the unvarnished greed of major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> oil companies were all it took to send gas prices soaring. Yet even before the disaster in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, crude oil prices had been rising steadily for several months as the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and other foreign producers gained greater control over the world market. Today, in fact, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is potentially far more vulnerable to price manipulation by the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel than in 1973, when the first oil shock dealt a body blow to the economies of the industrialized democracies. During the 1970s, this country relied on imported oil for about one-third of its total consumption. After seven years of declining domestic production amid sharply rising fuel use, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now depends on foreign sources for half of its petroleum needs. During 1988, exploration and drilling by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil industry declined to their lowest levels since record-keeping began in 1940. ... If fuel costs continue to mount, higher inflation will inevitably hasten a recession in this country and probably on a global scale as well.

The lawmakers who pushed through the Family Support Act of 1988 boasted that it would pay for itself by moving low-income families off the welfare rolls and into productive employment. But the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> now calculates that the measure will actually end up increasing the number of families on welfare. The total package will cost billions above current welfare costs. That would be OK if the result were to rescue poor people from the welfare trap. Instead, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s continued resistance to genuine reform will cause even more dependency.

To gain a competitive edge, players and coaches are willing to bend or break the rules _ using illegal drugs, passing money under the table, recruiting juvenile delinquents. The school also cooperate, giving preferential treatment to athletes by holding them to lesser academic standards than the rest of their student. Parents have also gotten in the act of trying to skirt the system by holding back their children in school so they can have an advantage. ... Sports is an after-school activity. Children are in school to learn how to read and write, not how to throw a pass. ... If parents want their children to succeed, they'd be better advised to focus their attention on books, not baskets.

 A criminal investigation has been launched into the use of tear gas by troops who broke up a pro-independence demonstration in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. Nineteen people died in the clash April 9 and another person was shot and killed for violating a curfew imposed to curb further demonstrations. At least 1,100 people were injured in the melee in the Georgian capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said at a news briefing that the investigation is being carried out by the chief military prosecutor. `` Due to the fact that tear gas was used on demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, a criminal case has been opened,'' he said. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> denied anyone died as a direct result of tear gas or any chemical substance used by soldiers to disperse the demonstrators. `` When autopsies were performed, the reasons for death were not the use of chemical gas or chemical substances,'' he said. This contradicted reports by the Georgian minister of health, <PERSON> Irakli </PERSON> <PERSON> Managarishvili </PERSON>, who said Tuesday that at least two of the victims died from gas used by troops. <PERSON> Managarishvili </PERSON> also said several others died from asphyxiation that may have been induced by the unidentified substance. Officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have confirmed only that tear gas was used, but doctors treating injured protesters said the victims were suffering a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by an unidentified chemical substance. One of the victims, <LOCATION> Gilo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oniani </LOCATION>, spoke with foreign correspondents in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on Monday during a trip arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oniani </PERSON>, a 34-year-old factory worker who was sprayed in the face with an aerosol, told reporters was unable to sleep due to nervous agitation and unable to eat due to pain in her abdomen. <PERSON> Manana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, the wife of jailed protest organizer <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview today that two men came to Mrs. <PERSON> Oniani </PERSON>'s hospital room late Monday and threatened her for speaking to reporters. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said a commission made up of top scientists from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and other major cities had been formed and would join in the investigation of the clashes. `` There are contradictory versions around the events in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>,'' he said, including the question of how many gases were used. `` The experts will be able to make their conclusions, and the public and representatives of the mass media will be informed of them as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said.

 Hundreds of truckers and other travelers got off Interstate 80 looking for Easy Street. Even the winners of a $ 46 million prize took a chance on tonight's <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> record $ 100 million lottery jackpot. `` You got to dream,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moellring </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, a trucker who bought five Super 7 tickets in this central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town Tuesday. Dreams abounded in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> as $ 24.35 million in lottery sales Tuesday topped the state's single-day record and brought total sales since Thursday to $ 67.26 million. Sales of the $ 1 tickets end about two minutes before the 6:59 p.m. drawing. `` The final total will be determined by how high sales go today,'' lottery executive director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said this morning on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today.'' `` It's probably at this point in time safe to predict that it'll be beyond $ 100 million.'' Lines formed as early as 4:30 a.m. today at lottery outlets from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to rural <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION> at the western end of the state. Race car driver <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Andretti </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, bought $ 100 worth of tickets from money he said came from the family grocery budget. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, police said people slept on curbs at several locations, waiting for ticket outlets to open at 6 a.m. `` I do n't believe in this stuff. I'm buying these for my grandfather. He's hooked,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohensky </PERSON>, a clerk for a federal agency who said it took her three days to find a place in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> with a short enough wait. Because of the huge crush of sales, lottery official <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> said the number of winning tickets, if any, would not be known until Friday. But <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a trucker hauling commercial carpets, had no doubts at a truck-stop restaurant on the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>. `` I've got the winning ticket. I've been praying,'' he joked. Even <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Despot </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION> couple who won a $ 46 million jackpot in 1987, got caught up. <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> said he bought 100 tickets for this week's Super 7, but he's not crossing his fingers he'll win. `` Nobody would want to play anymore if we won again,'' he said by telephone from his home near <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>. In Super 7, players pick seven numbers between 1 and 80. If all seven of those numbers are among the 11 selected, the ticket wins the jackpot. Lottery officials put the chances of having a winning ticket at 1 in 9.6 million. Super 7 reached its staggering nine-figure jackpot because no one picked the winning numbers for six consecutive weekly drawings. The jackpot starts at a minimum of $ 2 million and rolls over to the next drawing. A single winner of the $ 100 million would receive almost $ 3.85 million a year for 26 years before taxes, lottery officials said. The world's largest lottery jackpot, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gordo </LOCATION>, or `` the fat one,'' was recorded in December when hundreds of players split $ 159 million. The previous North American record was $ 69.9 million in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> for the April 15 drawing. That prize was shared by the owners of four tickets. Some out-of-state players drove into <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and some even flew commercial flights into <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> for a chance to win the gigantic jackpot. Citizens band radios crackled with lottery gossip, and many out-of-state truckers wanted to know where to buy tickets, travelers said. `` A lot of people from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> were saying they should not let them across the border to get their tickets,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, traveling to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with her mother. `` Some were saying, ` the more the merrier,''' added <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, a waitress from <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who was making her fourth stop Tuesday. She said she bought five tickets each time. A few enterprising folks from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> ferried tickets to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirlin </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> bought 2,500 of the $ 1 tickets and sold them for $ 3 apiece on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> streets Tuesday. In south-central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, an elderly man passed out after waiting four hours at the <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>'s Market in <LOCATION> Littlestown </LOCATION> to buy a single ticket. <PERSON> Gerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a clerk at the store, said the unidentified man was treated by an ambulance crew called to the scene and left the store on a stretcher, clutching his ticket. `` We gave him his ticket and saw that he got it before the ambulance arrived,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Police are investigating at least 28 incidents in which baby food bought at grocery stores contained glass shards, pieces of razor blades, thumbtacks and caustic soda. Eleven cases were reported today. The government said blackmail attempts had been made. The tampering, which apparently began this month, has resulted in at least two minor injuries. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said it was coordinating a nationwide police inquiry, but it refused to give details. The Daily Mail, a tabloid, reported blackmailers apparently were trying to extort money from supermarkets and food companies. It said several major supermarket chains and food manufacturers had received threats. Home Office Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today that `` in some cases there have been blackmail demands. It would not be helpful for police investigations if I were to go into any greater detail.'' Deploring what he called a `` vicious attack on defenseless babies'' by `` twisted minds,'' <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> said Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s administration `` is determined to resist all attempts at consumer terrorism in this country.'' The government said 28 cases had been reported since April 7, including 11 today. Manufacturers say their investigations have determined that products are not being spiked during production and distribution. One manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd, warned parents to be vigilant when feeding their children canned and bottled food <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said it shared parents' `` sense of outrage that a tamperer is prepared to target a victim as precious and vulnerable as a baby.'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said stocks were removed from shelves and replaced in all incidents where tampered products were found. But a supermarket in the northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION> removed all <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> products after a jar of baby food was found to contain slivers of glass. Spiked jars have been found in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in the central cities of <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION>, and across southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, news reports said. In three incidents reported Tuesday, pieces of glass were found in baby food bought in <LOCATION> Bradford-on-Avon </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in the south coast resort of <LOCATION> Fratton </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> on the Isle of Wight off the south coast. In the incident at <LOCATION> Bradford-on-Avon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyndall </PERSON> said she cut her lip on a piece of glass as she tasted a jar of fruit desert she was about to feed to her 6-month-old daughter. No one else was reported hurt in Tuesday's incidents. But in another incident earlier in the month, a 9-month-old girl in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> cut her mouth on a razor blade in a pot of yogurt. Other incidents were reported at <LOCATION> Rayleigh </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>; at the southern port of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, where two incidents were reported; and at the south coast resort of <LOCATION> Worthing </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Investigators today said they believe a young woman found dead along Interstate 195 is the ninth victim of a New Bedford-area serial killer. <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> `` would be very surprised if this were not a victim'' of the killer who left the bodies of eight women along southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> highways, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Pina </PERSON>. The woman was under 30 and had been dead 10 to 12 months, he said. The body, found Monday, will be checked against dental records of three missing women to identify the victim, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Investigators linked the body to the other killings because of where it was found, the position of the body, certain evidence found at the scene and information gleaned from the autopsy Tuesday, the spokesman said. He would not be more specific about the findings. The autopsy, which was to continue today, did not immediately determine the cause of death, he said. <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> investigators have declined to say how seven of the eight other victims died. They have said one was strangled. The eight victims so far identified all had links to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area, a district known for drugs and prostitution. The first of the bodies was found in July. The body of the apparent ninth victim was found in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about six miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The villagers of <PERSON> Langa </PERSON> on Wednesday mourned the loss of one of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s last wolves, which had made friends with villagers' dogs but pillaged reindeer herds. The wolf was killed last week, six months after wandering into the area displaying an unusual lack of fear of humans. A $ 1,600 reward was offered for the arrest of the killer. Police and the <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused to say how the animal was killed while the case was being investigated. Reindeer herdsmen denied responsibility. The killing ended a month of squabbling over the wolf's fate and whether it should be moved to another area. The department said it concluded the wolf would try to go back to its old hunting territory if it was moved, and attempts to scare it away with rubber bullets failed. The 150 villagers in <LOCATION> Langa </LOCATION>, 240 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, said the wolf had caused them no harm. They said it had played with their dogs, ignored sheep flocks and at times passed within six yards of humans. The wolf's death left only nine known wolves roaming wild in the valleys and deep forests of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Hunting regulations allow reindeer herders to shoot a wolf only if it is caught in the act of attacking their herds.

<TEXT>
 A homeless man who told police he wanted to be jailed took a bus for a cruise and dropped it off at police headquarters. He got his wish. According to police, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallezzo </PERSON>, 23, initially tried to get arrested by tossing a newspaper vending machine through a window Saturday night, but officers only gave him a summons for misdemeanor vandalism. Then, police said, he walked into police headquarters early Sunday and told Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogalski </PERSON>: `` I want to be arrested.'' <PERSON> Rogalski </PERSON> asked why. `` For stealing a bus,'' <PERSON> Gallezzo </PERSON> said. `` What bus?'' <PERSON> Rogalski </PERSON> asked. `` The one parked out front,'' <PERSON> Gallezzo </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Rogalski </PERSON> found a $ 175,000 bus belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> parked at the curb and accommodated Gallezzo. But <PERSON> Gallezzo </PERSON> was only briefly a guest of the city. After he pleaded innocent to larceny of a motor vehicle Monday, he was released on his own recognizance. `` If all he wanted was a night in jail there are easier ways he could have done it,'' said police Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Labato </PERSON>. `` And if he was looking for a place to sleep, he could have just stayed in the bus or gone to one of several shelters.'' Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON> said he let <PERSON> Gallezzo </PERSON> stay at the <ORGANIZATION> Northampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, a facility for alcoholics, when <PERSON> Gallezzo </PERSON> told him last week that he was living in a tent, but asked him to leave Saturday. `` He started some trouble with one of my boys, so I sent him packing,'' <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Investors Said to be Eager to Buy Shares in Medieval Map</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investors are lining up to become shareholders in the <ORGANIZATION> Mappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION> in a plan to keep the 13th-century map at <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, organizers said Wednesday. A new company called <ORGANIZATION> Mappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> is offering the public 7,450 shares at about $ 1,700 each to raise more than $ 12 million to keep the map at <LOCATION> Hereford </LOCATION> and pay for repairs to cathedral. Hereford Cathedral caused a national uproar when it announced last year it was auctioning off its medieval treasure, possibly to foreign buyers, to pay for the much-needed repairs. It then had hoped to raise $ 4.3 million selling the 708-year-old map, which shows <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> at the center of the world and <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> at the edge. But the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> subsequently joined forces with financiers to launch the unusual privatization. The bishop and the dean of <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> said they have been inundated with more than 100 applications from as far away as the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to buy shares in the map. Bishop of Hereford <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastaugh </PERSON> said he planned to buy a share for his wife and that many members of the Friends of <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> also planned to take up the offer. <PERSON> Eastaugh </PERSON> said: `` We are asking people to give a particular sum and to have an actual share in this great treasure which belongs to the nation. `` I feel very excited. I shall feel relieved when we've got the money in.'' The offer opens May 3 for a 42-day period and all shareholders are to receive reproductions of the map, bearing a seal and signed by the bishop, and the dean, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>. The idea was dreamed up by marketing specialist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Billingham </PERSON> who was upset when he read about the planned sale in the newspapers. He approached financiers, who then put the idea to the bishop and the dean. `` I think they had a tough time and it was a difficult decision for them to make. We had to explain something to them that was obviously alien, but I'm glad they've gone this route,'' <PERSON> Billingham </PERSON> said.

 Soccer fans hurled bricks, smashed store windows and looted a toy store today in unrest that broke out before the <LOCATION> Netherlands-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> World Cup qualification match, police said. Dutch fans threatened to storm the stadium unless more tickets were made available. Eights fans were arrested and an undetermined number were injured in the clashes, which began in the afternoon as fans were arriving for tonight's match in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Feyenoord </ORGANIZATION> stadium, said police spokesman <PERSON> Ger </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON>. Police on horseback and officers in riot gear were called in to disperse the estimated 500 rioting fans. In one case, a police helicopter suddenly dived to within about 30 feet above a group of marauding youngsters. Dozens of store windows were smashed, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> said. Shopkeepers lowered steel blinds and boarded up windows in an effort to protect their property. `` It's not really clear to us whether there's a confrontation going on'' between rival <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> fans, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Most fans in the downtown shopping area, where the rioting took place, appeared to be Dutch because of their orange scarves. Orange is the color of the Dutch national team. Authorities said the <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> stadium, which holds 57,000 people, was sold out except for 5 percent of the tickets, which were not being sold to avoid overcrowding. Dutch groups said they would storm the stadium unless more tickets were sold. A stampede at a soccer match April 15 in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, killed 95 people when fans, some apparently without tickets, rushed into a standing-room-only section of the stadium. Police deployed 600 officers, including 250 riot police, to quell any disturbances during the match. Fans will be subject to rigorous ticket checks and be frisked before being admitted to the stadium, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> said. Last year, in the semifinal match of the European soccer championships, the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> national team beat <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 2-1. That event sparked widespread street revelry. On Monday, the team of West German coach <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckenbauer </PERSON> was forced to evacuate its hotel in nearby <LOCATION> Wassenaar </LOCATION> because of a bomb threat. No bomb was found. An unidentified person claiming to be a member of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> terrorist group made the threat over the telephone.

<HEAD>Bush Calls For More Oil Drilling in Texas Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today the nation must accelerate exploratory oil drilling and make greater use of natural gas and coal resources. Saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains too heavily dependent on foreign oil more than 15 years after the energy shortage that produced long gas lines in 1974, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>: `` We need a national energy policy that relies not only on oil, but on many other sources.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who set himself up in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil business in the late 1940s and became a millionaire before entering public life, said in his prepared remarks, `` I know there are still a few dark clouds remaining on our economic horizon.'' But he said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is showing signs of recovering from the business slump brought about by the decline of the energy industry in recent years, and this has happened because an increasingly diversified economy has brought tens of thousands of high-tech jobs to the state. `` Still, no matter how diversified and high-tech <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has become, a strong domestic energy industry is important to the future of this state and all of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I find it disturbing that nearly 50 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oil is imported. This is not good for our national security.'' Maximizing use of oil resources will make the country less dependent on imported fuel, he said, and increasing reliance on alternative energy resources will give the country a cleaner environment. The president reiterated that the nation must not retreat from oil exploration because of the huge spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez off the coast of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` We are using federal resources intelligently in the cleanup effort,'' he said. `` We are working with industry to develop an improved plan in the event of a future spill.'' `` But shutting down our domestic energy production is no answer, and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` To reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we must return to high levels of exploratory drilling.'' He said he intends to stimulate domestic oil drilling `` with tax credits and other incentives.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not cite those incentives. But during his campaign for the presidency, he suggested a 10 percent tax credit for oil and gas exploration up to $ 10 million of costs and 5 percent above that. He also proposed eliminating 80 percent of intangible drilling costs as subject to the alternative minimum tax for independent producers. In his speech today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` at long last, to fully decontrol natural gas. I believe that this will happen soon.'' He said he believes the nation `` can and must use more safe nuclear power'' and said that `` coal has a bright future.'' `` As we all become increasingly concerned about the need for clean air, we must look more to natural gas and to nuclear power,'' he said. `` We must produce more of our corn crop to produce ethanol, more of our natural gas to produce methanol.'' `` Greater use of these two will rapidly improve the air quality of our most heavily populated cities,'' the president said.

 Hundreds of protesters jeered and a scuffle broke out as <ORGANIZATION> Chippewa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> went spearfishing under treaty rights held since the 1800s. Law officers broke up the scuffle Tuesday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservoir </ORGANIZATION>, which Indian fishermen had reached by driving 100 miles from their reservation in a 30-vehicle convoy escorted by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. No injuries were reported. An estimated 400 protesters also gathered at a boat landing at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nokomis </LOCATION>. Three were arrested, two for disorderly conduct and one for property damage, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> administrator of enforcement. The protesters object to the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> being allowed to leave their reservations and spear walleyed pike, muskellunge and other trophy-sized fish before the rod-and-reel season begins. The spearing season began Sunday. The Indians' treaty rights were upheld in 1983 by a federal court. At the reservoir, on the southern fringe of Indian land deeded to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1800s, 120 protesters carried an effigy with `` Injun Joe'' on its shirt and held signs that read, `` Spear an Indian, save a walleye,'' `` Equal rights for all Americans'' and `` Stop treaty abuse.'' The crowd cheered when someone yelled, `` Let's scalp'em.'' Spectators were separated from tribal fishermen on a boat landing by a police ribbon. Many surged forward after a <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> crossed in their direction in response to taunts. About half a dozen uniformed officers moved in and separated the man from the hecklers. He said he was pushed and shoved but unharmed. `` They taunted me to walk across and I walked across,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallier </PERSON>, 29. `` They were just being pretty mean and name-calling.''

 <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Despot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> are big, big fans of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lottery. They bet $ 100 would get them the $ 100 million jackpot in Wednesday's drawing to add to the $ 46 million they won two years ago. `` We want to be part of the action,'' said <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want to be left out,'' said <PERSON> Despot </PERSON>, 38. `` You get caught up in the excitement of it, so you want to be a part of it. It's fun.'' As long as they do n't win, that is. `` If we win, that's a different story,'' she said. `` Nobody would want to play anymore if we won again,'' he said. On Oct. 19, 1987, <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> and Despot claimed a $ 46 million jackpot, which was, at the time, the biggest prize in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The couple, who have been living together for seven years, quit their jobs, bought a few things _ cars, a farm, a horse _ and threw a party with fireworks for their central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town on the first anniversary of their win. But for the most part, Despot and <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> are spending money as if they've won thousands, not millions. And they say that's the way it's going to stay. `` They say lotteries are the stuff dreams are made of, and that's what it is if you do n't let it get ahead of you,'' Despot said in a telephone interview Tuesday night. `` Money gives you security so that you do n't sit and worry about your bills. But you still have problems. It's not the answer to everything. It ca n't buy you your health. If we get sick, we're sick like everybody else,'' he said <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> was a self-employed plasterer and Despot a $ 13,000-a-year bookkeeper for a car dealership when <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON>'s $ 25 investment in lottery tickets won them $ 46 million in the Super 7 game. They quit their jobs and now live on annual installments of $ 1.4 million, with 20 percent deducted for federal taxes. The payments are spread over 26 years. After 18 months, the millionaire lifestyle is slowly catching on. They still live in the same two-story, red-brick house in a development overlooking a section of <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION>, a town of 6,000. They plan to build a new home soon. Despot's 15-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>, still attends the public high school, and their neighbors still take care of their goldfish when they're out of town. `` Most people said we have n't changed,'' <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> said. `` We're still ourselves, and this is the way we want to stay This is our home town, and we decided this is where we want to live.'' For the first year, unsolicited requests for money came from every state and dozens of countries. <PERSON> Despot </PERSON> said she reads all the letters but rarely answers and never sends money. `` After so many of those letters, they all sound alike, and you do n't know which are legitimate or not. We ca n't start it. We ca n't save the world,'' she said `` We'll know if we're to help somebody. It will happen. I'm not looking, but it will happen.''

<TEXT>
 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> on Wednesday joined the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in a campaign to get physicians to help their patients quit smoking. They have put together a brochure outlining basic steps doctors should take to make smoking advice part of standard medical practice, and they're sending the pamphlet to 100,000 primary-care physicians. `` Seventy percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> see their doctors at least once a year,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. `` If doctors can get across to their patients some self-rewarding goal for stopping smoking, I believe the problem can be nearly licked.'' About 48 million, or 29 percent, of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults smoke, and one in every six deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is attributed to the effects of smoking, according to public health officials. The surgeon general, the country's most outspoken public health official in the fight against smoking, said new clinical trials conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> `` show that smokers whose doctors help them quit are up to six times more likely than other smokers to kick the habit for good.'' However, many physicians are reluctant to counsel their patients on smoking because they are uncomfortable with the subject, do n't believe they can help and feel they are intruding on a patient's privacy, he By giving doctors the information they need to help patients quit and offering training sessions for physicians, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> believes doctors will join the campaign and actively work to help their patients stop smoking. `` If only 10 percent of physicians routinely advised smokers to quit, and succeeded with only one in 20 patients, more than a million smokers would quit each year'' in addition to the million or so who already quit annually, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>, deputy director of the division of cancer prevention and control at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The four-step guidelines, developed by the institute and the cancer society on the basis of clinical trials, advise physicians to ask patients about their smoking habits and advise each smoker to quit. Then, doctors are asked to help patients willing to try to quit by setting a quit date, giving the patient self-help material and prescribing nicotine gum if needed for heavier smokers. Finally, they should arrange for follow-up support, including phone calls or office visits. The booklet also advises physicians on how to help patients manage weight gain and other withdrawal symptoms. Nearly half of all American adults who have ever smoked have stopped, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, noting that physicians have been leading the way, as less than 10 percent of them smoke. `` Now it's time for doctors to act in another way _ to preach what they practice,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Thursday will return 21 sets of remains that it believes may be the remains of Americans missing from the Vietnam War. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team is to pick up the remains in a ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> airport, then fly them to army laboratories in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for analysis and identification.

<HEAD>Vineyard to Pay Anheuser-Busch $1.1 Million for Grape Switch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A vineyard accused of trying to squeeze too much profit from <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> by passing off wine made from cheaper grapes instead of zinfandel has agreed to pay the alcohol company nearly $ 1.1 million. The settlement, made last month and disclosed in court documents Tuesday, involved a lawsuit filed in federal court earlier this year. The suit said <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> had contracted to buy 900 tons of 100 percent zinfandel grapes from <PERSON> Bavaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON>, a grower in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION>. The grapes were to be sent to <LOCATION> Verdugo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vineyards </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Acampo </LOCATION> for processing into white zinfadel wine. But a government inspection found some of the wine delivered to Master Cellars, an <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> division, was made from as little as 22.9 percent zinfandel juice. That meant the wine, by law, could not be sold as white zinfandel. `` Instead of having a value of $ 1 million, it's worth barely $ 197,359,'' the suit said. Under the agreement approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bavaro </PERSON> agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> nearly $ 1.1 million. In return, <PERSON> Bavaro </PERSON> can try to sell the thousands of gallons of wine and apply the money to the settlement. A ton of zinfandel grapes can sell for $ 950, compared to $ 150 for, say, chenin blanc, according to the suit.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today prayed for divine guidance to rise above `` narrow self-interest'' as it began work on savings and loan legislation, and then immediately adopted a provision designed to favor the hometown bank of a powerful lawmaker. Other amendments to help out two of the nation's largest bank holding companies _ <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> _ swiftly followed. The votes came as the panel debated legislation recommended by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to bail out the savings and loan industry, and the thorny issue of what type of capital requirements should be imposed on S & amp; Ls. Both the administration and the two party leaders on the committee now want to make S & amp; L owners put up $ 2.25 of their own money as `` tangible'' capital for every $ 100 they lend. `` If we adopt weak standards _ and allow the kitchen sink to count as capital _ we are voting to shift the burden to the taxpayers,'' committee Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said in an opening statement. However, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the panel's financial institutions subcommittee, said the new standards will drive healthy, honest S & amp; L operators out of business and precipitate the need for another taxpayer-financed bailout in the `` Instead of going in and removing the crooks, we are choosing to launch a poison gas attack on the industry and adopting the philosophy of ` kill'em all,''' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said. The unusual opening prayer was offered by <PERSON> Del </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-D.C. </LOCATION>, a Baptist minister, who said that in his 19 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had never felt such a need for divine guidance before. After the prayer, the committee approved, 37-11, an amendment that <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said was intended to protect from a liability provision only the <ORGANIZATION> Frost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, his hometown. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, who favors less-stringent S & amp; L capital standards than the administration now wants, led the opposition. `` Your amendement comes at a bad time,'' he told <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. `` Everyone is asking for private legislation.'' Immediately afterwards, the committee approved an amendment by Reps. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>, D-Del., and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, exempting <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> from financial liability in their acquisition of two institutions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Both amendments were unopposed by the administration. Several more calling for similar exemptions were on the committee's schedule <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said his, <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>'s and the administration's new desire for stricter capital standards than first sought are `` the guts of this whole issue.'' Anything less, he said, will `` simply mean that we let the industry, once again, roll the dice with taxpayers' money.'' However, S & amp; L supporters and even some of the industry's harshest critics in the past expressed fears that a new demand for a cash equity infusion that large and that quickly _ by June 1991 _ will drive 800 to 1,200 of the nation's 2,950 remaining thrifts out of business. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to come in and practice euthanasia on institutions that are not in trouble,'' complained Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a past critic of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L practices. `` These immediate and precipitous demands are going to create a bank panic that will bring 10 times as much trouble as we need.'' <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial $ 90 billion bailout proposal was built on the premise that roughly 500 S & amp; Ls would fail the capital test he first sought, instead of the 800 to 1,200 that would be unable to meet the proposed new $ 2.25 `` tangible'' standard. `` If we drive institutions unnecessarily into insolvency, it is the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer who will bear the increased cost _ a far greater cost than anyone is presently contemplating,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated the cost to the government of liquidating S & amp; Ls that fail to meet the proposed new `` tangible'' capital standard at $ 130 billion _ twice what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial proposal and a Senate-approved version would cost. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial proposal unveiled in February called for doubling the <ORGANIZATION> capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> required </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls from the current 3 percent to 6 percent. But none of that capital under his proposal had to be `` tangible'' _ in the form of stock or retained earnings easily convertible to cash. Theoretically, an S & amp; L could remain in business with no direct equity investment by its owners under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial legislative initiative. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s financial institutions subcommittee two weeks ago imposed a 1.5 percent `` tangible'' capital requirement, as did the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week. Both of those actions were praised by administration officials, who then decided late last week that even more `` tangible'' capital should be required, according to congressional and administration sources. Among the 2,700 technically solvent S & amp; Ls at the end of the year, only about half of their $ 60 billion in capital was `` tangible.'' The rest _ $ 21 billion in so-called `` supervisory good will,'' $ 4 billion in subordinated debt and $ 3 billion in deferred loan losses _ is all the result of what critics call `` smoke and mirrors'' accounting practices. That `` phantom capital'' accounting was greatly expanded by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in the early 1980s to encourage healthy S & amp; Ls to take over sick ones as a way of avoiding payouts from the federal deposit insurance fund, which is insolvent itself.

 A prosecutor calls it the biggest white-collar crime case in state history, with the main trial expected to last three months and charges pending in several counties _ and it all concerns a clam. Not just any clam. This is about the world's second-largest species of clam, a long-necked ugly thing called a geoduck, pronounced gooey-duck, after an Indian word for `` dig deep.'' With about 135 workers, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s geoduck industry in 1987 generated $ 1.8 million for the state, which leases tracts for harvesting in Puget Sound, <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and other inland marine waters. State officials said they had no figures on the commercial value of the harvest. At an auction this spring, four of 12 bidders won rights to seven tracts covering 300 acres at a record average price of 68 cents a pound, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKillip </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>. Depending on the catch, the state could realize $ 1.9 million to $ 3.5 million, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyser </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> leasing manager. But booming demand also generated `` Clamscam,'' a complex criminal case against seven people and eight corporations and a `` criminal profiteering'' civil suit against most of the same parties and a few others. The defendants are accused of overharvesting and taking geoducks from outside their leased tracts since 1970. The clams are found along the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and weigh as much as 10 pounds. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have the only noteworthy geoduck industries, with average known harvests of 4.6 million pounds in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and 10 million pounds in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> between 1980 and 1985, said <PERSON> McKillip </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> geoduck is frequently used in canned and fast-food chowder and occasionally as an entree in restaurants. `` It's got kind of a sweet taste. You can tell'' when it's used in chowder, said <PERSON> McKillip </PERSON>. The succulent flesh also is a sushi superstar and top-quality live geoducks sell for as much as $ 12 a pound in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But the monster mollusks look, well, odd, with a sinuous brown neck or siphon that extends from several inches to a few feet out of a shell six inches or longer, producing disgust, disdain and occasional titters at seafood stands. `` Would you promise me one thing? Please do n't call me the geoduck queen,'' pleaded King County deputy prosecutor <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenneman </PERSON> in a telephone interview last week. `` This is the kind of case that could follow me the rest of my life.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>, 58, of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, 37, of <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON>, each could face life in prison if convicted of leading organized crime. Four others, including <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON>, face lesser felony charges. As top officers, suppliers and associates of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> and related companies, they are accused of illegally taking more than 1 million pounds of geoducks worth at least $ 1.8 million. <PERSON> Brenneman </PERSON> called it `` the largest state white-collar crime case ever tried in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> courts.'' Two of the nine people initially charged in the criminal case have pleaded guilty to reduced charges and agreed to testify for the state. <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON> and another criminal defendant also are among those being sued by the state for treble damages, an amount that could exceed $ 3 million. <PERSON> Brenneman </PERSON> predicted the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> criminal trial will last at least three months with testimony from 130 to 150 of the 180 potential witnesses she has listed. She also planned to present 1,000 to 2,000 of the 70,000 bank records, shipping receipts and other documents identified as potential evidence. Jury selection began last week and was expected to run at least through late this week, court officials said. Charges involving other areas of Puget Sound and Hood Canal are pending in <LOCATION> Kitsap </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> counties. Washington King Clam, formed in 1970 by <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> with <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON> holding a minority interest, led in developing the export trade and in recent years controlled 90 percent of the state's geoduck industry, <PERSON> McKillip </PERSON> said. Documents filed by Prosecutor <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleng </PERSON> said about 40 former <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clam </ORGANIZATION> employees or business associates told of illegal harvesting of the brobdingnagian bivalves since the company was formed. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> of the prosecutor's office said the 20-month investigation unearthed a pattern of crimes that began as far back as 1970 and continued over the years, with the most recent incident last October. With the filing of charges last fall, the state canceled five leases to Geoduck Harvest, by then owned by a Japanese company, and principals in the case were banished from further bidding.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he wants former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to take on `` various missions and assignments'' in the foreign policy field. Answering reporters questions as he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> began a meeting at the former president's office here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to keep <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` fully informed'' about world events. The president also said that in his talks with some 35 world leaders since taking office last Jan. 20, he has found that `` the respect for him -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- around the world knows no bounds.'' `` I hope I can talk him into various missions and assignments as time goes by,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he sat next to the man he served as vice president for eight years. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he considers the White House `` in good hands'' as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nears the 100-day mark of his presidency and that his successor was `` doing fine.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not specify what assignments he was considering giving to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and the former president did not respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement about his plan But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did say that `` I have a lot more to learn from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and I learned a lot about principle and the world as it really is. I wanted to talk to him about change abroad ... get his advice.'' Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would respond to reporters' questions about the Iran-Contra trial of fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> on grounds the matter was still before the courts. `` Here's one where I think we're both in the same boat,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Reporters had asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> whether he had been aware of White House documents that were never seen by the congressional investigative committees. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has talked by phone to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a few times. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, chatting with reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One earlier this week, said, `` I do n't ever say what I talk to the president about. But then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did acknowledge he had called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recently to discuss news reports that quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides anonymously as making disparaging statements about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I thought an explanation was in order,'' the president said. One such story, which had unnamed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides mocking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s laid-back management style, led White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to warn presidential aides against making such statements The Bush-Reagan meeting comes at a time when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is making high-profile public appearances aimed at restating administration themes as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nears the 100-day mark of his presidency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put in a 14-hour day in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Tuesday, giving a business-oriented speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, then visiting a 213-acre ranch in the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hill country that had been a drug distribution center. He was reunited with Hispanic Republican supporters on the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and wound up the day by watching major league baseball's <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> 8-1 at <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>. `` Many of you know the history of the ground we stand on,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as he stood before huge stacks of money _ more than $ 4 million _ seized in the raid that broke up the drug-dealing center. `` Once a warehouse of death, now it's a source of hope,'' he said. Speaking to the Hispanic audience, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that he soon was to meet with `` one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest presidents. I'm talking about <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s always-favorite son and my good friend, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' The former president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, are enjoying their retirement here, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> spend a considerable amount of time answering mail and will continue to travel and speak. But the former president has not attracted huge crowds at some public speaking engagements, and he recently waived his $ 50,000 honorarium when a smaller-than-expected crowd turned out for a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In his more than three months in office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has distanced himself from some <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies and has adopted a more energetic presidential management style. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, though a lifelong member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has moved to limit the proliferation of assault-type weapons by imposing a ban on imports of many of these guns. Unlike <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he moved quickly to strike a bipartisan agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that essentially puts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a diplomatic, rather than military, course, in seeking democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has proposed a more far-reaching ethics package and will likely seek a strengthening of the Clean Water Act, a more environmentalist position than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took.

<HEAD>Bangladesh Gets Rain After Residents Offer Prayers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rain fell in parts of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> on Wednesday after people across the country prayed for an end to a drought that threatens to destroy almost 50 percent of the rice crop. Hours after the prayer by more than 75,000 Moslems led by President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, it rained in the capital of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> and three other districts, the weather bureau said. The rain, .16 inches to .96 inches, was not enough to ease drought conditions, but it was a welcome relief. Religious Affairs Minister <PERSON> Nizamuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Azad </PERSON> said people knelt in mosques, temples, churches and pagodas across the nation to pray for rain. Thousands more could not attend the ceremonies because of traffic jams. About 26 of the country's 63 administrative districts have been suffering by a lack of rainfall. Agriculture is the main occupation of most of the country's 110 million people. Some areas have irrigation channels and pumps but most of the canals ran dry when subterranean ground water levels plunged, news reports said. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita annual income of $ 160, alternates between flood and drought. Last summer, more than 1,400 people died in floods that submerged four-fifths of the low-lying nation. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> produces about 17 million tons of grains a year. The target of the spring rice crop _ which has been affected this year by the drought _ was 5.6 million tons. In addition, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> imports about 2 million tons of grains a year to meet the shortfall of 1.5 million tons in production and build a reserve. The drought and the hot weather has also threatened operations at the country's lone hydroelectric power plant near the southern port city of <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>, about 120 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. The project was set up in the mid-1960s by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Weather forecasters say there will be no respite from the drought for another two weeks, and a hot spell will aggravate the situation in the coming days. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said nearly half the crop would be destroyed if the drought persisted a few more days. `` I fear the crop loss may be 50 percent of the total. No rains in the next few days may spell disaster for agriculture,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A senior government official said Monday the government had sufficient grain reserves to prevent people from starving. `` The government is determined that no one will die for want of food,'' said Relief Minister <PERSON> Sirajul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>.

 Representatives of the nation's cities and counties pleaded with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday not to use higher gasoline taxes to reduce the federal deficit. `` The federal gasoline tax has been used to construct a fine highway system in this country and it should only continue to be used to improve and enhance this system,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Cattaraugus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, legislator, told a news conference. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> estimates that between $ 261 billion and $ 314 billion in capital investment is needed just to maintain the nation's urban road network at 1985 levels,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Mager </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, alderman speaking for the National League of Cities. `` We must not let a serious problem grow into a calamity by diverting the funding source that is intended for our vital transportation needs,'' <PERSON> Mager </PERSON> said. Some key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> advocate a hefty increase in the 9.1-cent-a-gallon tax to bring down the budget deficit. The levy now is earmarked for transportation.

 <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, a senior politician with a reputation for integrity and consensus building, has led <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> through troubled times before. Now chairman of the Executive Council, the governing party's main decision-making body, <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> is considered a likely successor to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> because of his experience in senior party posts and his image as a clean politician untainted by the Recruit influence-peddling scandal <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> appears to be reluctant to accept the post of acting prime minister, saying his age _ 75 _ and his health problems as a diabetic should disqualify him. Nevertheless, many observers believe he would serve if asked. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> served as acting Prime Minister nearly 10 years ago following the sudden death of his political mentor, Prime Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohira </PERSON>. It was a difficult time for the Liberal Democrats. They had just suffered serious losses in an election called by <PERSON> Ohira </PERSON>. Then, divided by internal battles, the governing party lost a no-confidence vote in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. National elections followed less than two weeks later. Under <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s stewardship, the governing party closed ranks and won. <PERSON> Zenko </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> became prime minister in July 1980 and named <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> as foreign minister. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> served in that capacity until 1982 when he resigned in a dispute over relations between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After a summit meeting, the opposition objected when the government used the term `` alliance'' to describe the Japanese-U.S. ties. The government blamed <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s ministry for failing to explain the term did not imply <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would build up its military or be dragged into future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wars. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> resigned in typical Japanese fashion to `` accept responsibility'' for mixup, a move that further bolstered his reputation for integrity. <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsukuba </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would do well to offer <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> the job. `` I think we need exactly that kind of person to cope with the crisis,'' <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> `` is a low-profile person, a consensus builder. He is apparently not involved in big money-making connections with business.'' <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> also has no party power base of his own and is instead a member of a faction headed by <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, a former prime minister hopeful who was forced to resign as finance minister due to ties with Recruit. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, a 1936 graduate of the prestigious Law Faculty of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which has produced much of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar elite, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> for eight straight terms from a prefecture in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Early Assessments In, Bush Not Yet Tested</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Under the handy but artificial deadline of 100 days, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is receiving the first report card of his presidency before any real test of his ability to handle the job. The early assessments offer neither rave reviews nor harsh criticism. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins praise for his outstretched, bipartisan hand and his open style, but catches grief for what he might call `` the vision thing,'' his failure to articulate any direction other than an intention to pursue a moderate version of Reaganism. Even <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has expressed impatience with how long it is taking the new administration to complete its foreign policy review. Perhaps the most difficult ordeal of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's first months was the fight over his nomination of former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be secretary of defense The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected the nomination after a long, partisan bloodletting, an event sure to leave scars. But despite widespread expectations that it signalled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' intent to challenge the new president for dominance, the bitter fight has largely faded from memory. In fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s willingness to work with the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has led to compromises on the budget and Contra aid, issues on which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration never came close to agreement with the Democrats. `` I think he's done a pretty good job,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said benchmarks like 100-day assessments were `` completely arbitrary ... simply a creation of others.'' While there is no magic to the 100-day mark, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself walked into that trap. The day after his landslide victory, he said, `` We will now have 70-whatever days it is to formulate a game plan, a first 100 days priorities, if you will, and they'll be specific, and I will do my level best to fulfill my commitments to the American people.'' No such specific game plan emerged, either during the transition or in his inaugural address, which was more an exercise in setting a stylistic tone than spelling out an agenda. `` A good start,'' was the president's own low-key assessment of his first three months in office. He cited bipartisan agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the budget and Contra aid and his plan to stabilize the troubled savings and loan industry. Presidential scholar <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was less generous: `` I think his grade is incomplete. We still have yet to see what he's going to do if anything.'' But the ultimate tests of presidents are events that adhere to no timetables. Let the economy turn sour, the stock market drop or interest rates, inflation or unemployment jump; or let <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s image abroad be shaken by a terrorist act or other foreign policy crisis and the public will take its measure of the president's philosophical bearings and leadership ability <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not yet faced a major crisis. His predecessors, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, are remembered far differently for their ability to deal with hard times. Few presidents could match <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s skill dealing with adversity, whether it was the prolonged recession that marked his first two years in the White House or the deaths of 241 American servicemen in 1983, when a terrorist bomb destroyed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine barracks in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Few presidents showed less talent for dealing with adversity than <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who was unable to deflect public unease over an economy battered by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and the frustration that built during the Iranian hostage crisis. At the hundred-day mark of their administrations, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> either could n't predict or did n't recognize the events on which their terms would be judged. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> began with the image of a president with a distinctive style who knew where he wanted to go. He gave a positive assessment of his first 100 days, citing his energy program, nuclear arms reduction proposals and emphasis on human rights. Four years later, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was firmly in charge and looking certain to win congressional approval of his tax and budget cutting proposals. He weathered an assassination attempt and gave a clear demonstration of the style and wit that would serve him so well throughout his presidency. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was president, he clearly was the dominant figure in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> somehow less a commanding figure than his predecessor? `` For six of his eight years, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` I think there was a marked difference between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first six years and his last two -LRB- when the Democrats were back in control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. ... I think the fairer test is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first months against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last two years and there, I think the difference is not so great.''

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration came down Wednesday on the side of the changes Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has engineered in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership and said it hoped the result would be a strengthening of democratization and openness. In a statement, the administration described <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s purge of 74 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> full voting members and the promotion of several of the Soviet leader's proteges as dramatic and stressed they were a matter of internal Soviet policy. But the administration then went on express hope that `` whatever changes occur, their effect is to strengthen and promote the reform process in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> toward greater democratization and openness.'' The statement was read by <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, in response to questions at the department's daily press brefing. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will hold talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 10-11 with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. They are expected to set a date for a resumption of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles and to discuss prospects for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also may make preliminary preparations with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> for a summit meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Soviet leader. <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON> last week praised the economic reform program <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has undertaken but said the Soviet leader could be in trouble unless `` there are consumer goods on the table and in the markets.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> that the risk to the Soviet leader could come from opponents of change, entrenched elements of the bureaucracy and from `` sources of nationalistic discontent.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic program, known in Russian as perestroika, was in the best interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the world because it would lead to a more secure and stable <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We very much want perestroika to succeed,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in response to a question after a speech. `` We very much want the general secretary to succeed.'' But, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, political reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was proceeding faster than economic reform. `` That might trigger something,'' he said. `` These things generally have to proceed apace.'' The purged 74 party officials and another 35 non-voting members who also were jettisoned represented a potential source of opposition to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` The situation has changed considerably, comrades,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said after the removal of nearly one-fourth of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> membership. `` Vast changes have taken place over this period also in state bodies, and this required personnel changes.''

 A man pulled his son off a life-support system today while holding hospital staff members at bay with a gun and cradled the baby in his arms until the child died, authorities said. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, 23, of <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>, was charged with murdering his 16-month-old son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney's office. Police said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, walked into Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> about 1 a.m. and were escorted to the pediatric intensive care unit, where their son's breathing had been sustained on a ventilator since an accident in About 20 minutes later, <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> pulled out a .357 - caliber handgun, ordered the lone nurse out of the unit, unhooked the infant from the life-support system and sat with his son in his arms, said police <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>. The child died about 30 minutes later, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said. About a half-dozen security personnel responded to the nurse's call for help, and gathered just outside the room `` I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'll only hurt you if you try to plug my baby back in,'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> as saying. `` He never pointed the gun at anyone other than the child,'' said <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>. `` He sat there in a chair until the baby had expired, then turned the gun over to the officers.'' <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> `` did a lot of crying,'' said Detective <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> said the couple had planned to see a lawyer Friday about having the child's life-support system disconnected. She was not charged in the case. `` This is the best thing,'' she said in an interview with radio station WBBM-AM. `` <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> is out of his misery.'' Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> had been brought to Rush-Presbyterian by ambulance last summer after he swallowed an object _ believed to be either a balloon or a small piece of aluminum foil _ that blocked his windpipe. Oxygen deprivation left him `` partially brain dead,'' and he had been in a coma since his arrival, said Ms. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. Doctors had notified the parents earlier Tuesday that the child was to be transferred to a long-term care unit, she added. `` You can understand the motivation,'' said <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>. `` I guess he did n't want his child to continue living under those conditions.'' <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON> said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> unhooked his son's life-support system during a visit Dec. 30, but the staff reconnected the apparatus. When <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> arrived today, he spoke briefly with security personnel but was not searched, <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> is a painter who has two other children, both under 5. In 1985, a father shot to death his severely brain-damaged 3-year-old daughter in a hospital crib in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, who was sentenced to life in prison for murder, said he `` did n't want to see her hurt anymore.'' The girl has been injured when her head became caught in the foot rest of a living room recliner.

 The actor who played <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> on the `` I Love Lucy'' show said Wednesday he spent more time with <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> than he did with his own family in the five years he played the comedian's TV son. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> died of a ruptured aorta at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Wednesday morning, hospital officials said. She was 77. `` She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so I was not shocked by her death,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Thibodeaux </PERSON>, who at age 6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world. `` I'm sure all this is going to hit me a little later on.'' <PERSON> Thibodeaux </PERSON> grew up on the set, playing Little <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> from 1956 until 1961 under Miss Ball's watchful eye. `` I think the thing I remember most about <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> was that she was very much in control of everything,'' said <PERSON> Thibodeaux </PERSON>, who began playing the drums at age 2, was a professional drummer at age 4 and is now drummer with <PERSON> David </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>, a Christian rock group. He lives in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with his wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, a ballerina. <PERSON> Thibodeaux </PERSON>, 38, said he got his break in show business when big band leader <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidt </PERSON> persuaded his father to bring him from <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the `` Swift Premium Hour,'' a traveling radio show that led to a string of one-night stands across the country. That led to an audition for the `` I Love Lucy'' role in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` I remember <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> saying, ` that's him,' and from that time I was <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Thibodeaux </PERSON>, who then used the name <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>. `` I signed a seven-year contract with the studio in 1956 and the first episode I was in was aired that December with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> _ I just turned 6.'' <PERSON> Thibodeaux </PERSON> said that during the series' run he spent as much time with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> as with his own family in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>. `` And I spent more time with her off the set at her home than at the studio,'' he said. `` I remember her as very strict but with a lot of love. She had her ways but despite all, she was a great person, very, very talented. `` I know everybody remembers her as zany and wacky but that was only on the show. Actually, she was just the opposite and was very serious. ... That's what made her a great actress.'' He said Miss Ball often gave him gifts and that he remembers spending at least one Christmas at her home. `` I remember she once gave me an Indian tepee, then my own dressing room,'' he said. `` She gave me bicycles and an identical set of drums.''

<HEAD>Regulators Considering Deal to Create Nation's Biggest Utility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal regulators on Wednesday took a first step in considering whether to approve a merger of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, a hotly contested deal that would create the nation's largest private utility. The case has broad implications for the electric power industry, including a possible impact on legal and political clashes over utilities' use of their monopolistic powers. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted to send the proposed <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> merger to an administrative law judge for hearings on a limited number of issues. The judge would then recommend a final action by the commission. Last week, stockholders of the two utilities approved the deal, under which <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Rosemead </LOCATION>, would acquire <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> in a stock swap valued at about $ 2.56 billion. The surviving company would be controlled by <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>. The deal requires approval by a variety of regulatory agencies, including the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> utility serves 1 million customers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> has 3.8 million customers in central and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The two utilities have pledged to cut power rates for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> commercial, industrial and agricultural customers by 5 percent, and to make a 10 percent reduction in rates for residential customers. This would mean a savings to customers over the next decade of $ 1.7 billion, the companies have said. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and several other <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities, as well as the state attorney general and some utility industry associations are opposed to the proposed merger on a variety of grounds, mainly that it would dimnish competition. The city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> has raised especially strong objections. It has accused <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> of coercing the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> utility into agreeing to the merger. A legal petition by the city includes depositions from two former members of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> board of directors who testified under oath that <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> `` inflicted transmission access problems'' on its merger target. The city claims this was done to pressure <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> to agree. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> earlier said there was not enough evidence of coercion to formally consider the matter, but in its order Wednesday the commission said it would allow the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to present more information. In its order to the administrative law judge, the commission rejected a request by a group of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities, including <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, to deny the merger before holding hearings. The cities contend the merger is anti-competitive. The federal order also rejected a request by the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> that the merger's possible environmental implications be made part of the review process. The commission said that based on currently available information, the proposed merger raised no issues that would require an environmental impact statement. It added, however, that it might reconsider the matter if new evidence arose later in the merger review. Among the issues to be considered at the administrative law hearing are the probable effects of the merger on utility rates and the expected benefits of integrating the two merging companies' electrical generation and transmission systems No date was set for the hearings. The companies' merger agreement of last year sets a deadline of March 31, 1990, for gaining final regulatory approval.

<HEAD>Ninth Murder Victim Found Along Massachusetts Highway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The death toll from a killer apparently stalking prostitutes and drug users rose to nine Wednesday as investigators tentatively identified another body left along a southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> highway. Authorities said an autopsy on the ninth victim, found Monday along Interstate 195 in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, yielded a preliminary identification. But they declined to release the name pending confirmation with dental records. Police said the position of the body and other details matched those of the previous eight victims, all women ages 25 to 36 who lived in or near the seaport of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. But investigators declined to make the details public, citing a rash of false confessions. `` We have people who have come in here and confessed to these crimes, but we ask them, ` How did you do it? What transpired? How did you leave the women?' and the information they give is just very wrong,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office. Accounts by a highway worker and others who found the bodies have led to speculation that the women have been strangled with their clothing and left face down, or in fetal positions. But almost any conversation on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> street is likely to yield a new theory. None of the murders appears to be recent. Forensic experts said the bodies, all found since July, had been lying along the highways for months. Despite the decomposed state of the bodies, investigators have been able to identify all of the previous eight as drug users or prostitutes. <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> has said he has several suspects, and a grand jury has been hearing evidence for months, but no indictments have been issued.

 It's the kind of story <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON> might have written, if he were still alive. The plot: What to do with the ashes of the late author, that is to say the half of his ashes that were n't sent to Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> after he died in 1981 at age 72. The characters in this `` Human Comedy,'' to borrow the title of <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>'s most popular novel: _ Friends who want his remaining ashes interred in the local Armenian cemetery topped by a monument fitting for <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>'s famous native son. _ The <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saroyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which is n't certain what should be done with <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>'s ashes. _ Newspaper columnist <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Setencich </PERSON> who is having the time of his life writing about <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>'s ashes. It was <PERSON> Setencich </PERSON> who started the fuss by writing in his <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> Bee column last week that half of <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>'s ashes still were sitting on a shelf in a local mortuary, and some folks were thinking of putting them in Ararat Cemetery. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> story about <PERSON> Setencich </PERSON>'s musings drew the attention of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Setrakian </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saroyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which was one of the places <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON> spent time when he was n't in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Setrakian </PERSON> wrote a letter to <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirkhanian </PERSON>, one of the <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> folks who favors a move to the cemetery for <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>'s ashes, which are encased in an urn carrying an inscription that calls <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON> an `` author and humanitarian.'' `` Frankly, I find this whole article disturbing what with the apparent cavalier approach by some of Mr. <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>'s friends, as well intentioned as they may be,'' <PERSON> Setrakian </PERSON> wrote. The letter pointed out that <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON> directed that upon his death he be cremated and half of his ashes be taken `` to an appropriate location in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.'' The directive quoted by <PERSON> Setrakian </PERSON> makes no mention of any desired final resting place for the other half of his ashes, whether on a shelf or wherever. <PERSON> Setrakian </PERSON> insisted, however, that the foundation has legal control of the ashes. He said trustees would consult with <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Cosette </PERSON> <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>, about her wishes <PERSON> Amirkhanian </PERSON> said Tuesday <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON>'s sister `` thought it was a wonderful idea'' to build a monument at the cemetery, and he would work with the foundation in an attempt to locate the ashes there. <PERSON> Setencich </PERSON> concluded on Wednesday that <PERSON> Saroyan </PERSON> probably is up there somewhere enjoying the squabble over his ashes and `` writing a neat story about it.''

Many of the statement's signers are pro-PLO figures. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for elections to select Palestinians from the occupied territories to hold talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on an interim solution for the troubled region. After two years, discussions would begin toward a permanent solution. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rules out any participation by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terrorist organization, and says there never will be an independent Palestinian state in the territories. The plan, outlined by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> during a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier this month, won the cautious approval of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and major <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, such as <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, have said they favor an international conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s top spokesmen could not be reached for comment because of the Passover holiday. <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said: `` I realize the difficulty the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are having with the fact that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is speaking about an interim agreement and is not indicating anything about the final status.'' But he said that Israelis fear the gap between the two sides is too great to bridge without a phased approach. `` I want to stress that the Israeli thinking is if we start from the end, we wo n't have a beginning,'' <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said. `` This is the idea behind the step-by-step approach that was accepted by the Americans.'' The Palestinians' statement, issued in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and English, described the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan as `` calculated to appeal to the media, to end the uprising and to win time.'' It insisted that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is `` the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people'' and that any election plan that excluded the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was `` an attempt to divide our people into ` inside' and ` outside' Palestinians.'' The statement did not rule out elections entirely but said they must come in a framework that would lead to formation of a Palestinian state. `` This isolated occurrence of elections does not illustrate how it will lead to the end of the occupation and to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> national independence,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, it said, should be authorized to administer the territories during a transitional period to Palestinian statehood. Chief among the 83 signers of the document was <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, who has met with Egyptian officials on the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan. He earlier met with Israeli officials on their peace proposals. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> is considered the main spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in the occupied territories, and he was held in jail without charges for most of the uprising. Others who signed the document included university professor <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Haidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Shafi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baramki </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Beir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; Mayor <PERSON> Hilme </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanoun </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ranteesi </PERSON>, an Anglican priest from <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Interior Urged to Strengthen Regulations Used to Estimate Oil Spill
Damage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Environmental groups and six states called on the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to strengthen regulations being used as guides in estimating damage to natural resources from the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill. The present regulations, which <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> officials have confirmed are being used in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, already are the subject of a lawsuit claiming they are too lax on polluters and prevent adequate compensation for major oil or toxic chemical spills. The regulations place `` an absurdly low value on wildlife and other resources,'' maintained <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group which is among those who have challenged the regulations in court. The critics asked in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> that the regulations be rewritten so that more than `` market value'' of destroyed resources is used in assessing recovery costs in a long-term settlement on damages caused by the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill. In addition to Ms. <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, the authors of the letter included the attorneys general of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. The regulations also have been criticized by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> and officials of a number of other states as being too easy on polluters. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged in interviews Tuesday that the government has agreed to use guidelines giving polluters the option of paying only the `` market value'' of resources they destroy, rather than the cost of restoring the environment to its pre-spill condition if the market value is cheaper. The decision comes despite administration promises to seek `` complete restoration'' of losses from the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> tanker spill that has fouled <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s wildlife-rich Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The regulations in question stem from the 1980 Superfund law which required Interior to establish guidelines on assessing damage resulting from an oil spill or discharge of toxic chemicals. The regulations were supposed to make it easier for states and federal trustees of public lands to recover damages. But Interior took nearly six years to draw them up and, according to critics, did so in 1986 substantially along the lines sought by the oil industry. `` The rules are there, they make sense and we're going to start to use them,'' said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> official involved with the damage assessment effort. `` The intent is that we're going to set a dollar value'' on the damages. Ms. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said, however, that the regulations are viewed as a framework for making the assessments and do not necessarily preclude other actions being taken. The rules, however, are under challenge in the federal courts. Three environmental groups and 10 states have filed suit accusing Interior of violating the Superfund law by making the regulations too lax. In February, six weeks before the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spill, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> vigorously defended the regulations at a hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. No decision has yet been made by the court. `` The rules create a myriad of ... economic, scientific and administrative obstacles to the recovery of funds needed to restore damaged resources,'' maintains <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitzenstein </PERSON>, an attorney for Public Citizen. <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, an lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, another plaintiff in the suit, said if the damage assessments are determined under <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s regulatory guidelines, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> could well escape substantial liability. During the recent court hearing, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys defended the reliance on `` use value'' and `` market value'' to determine damages on natural resources. Lawyers for the environmental groups and states argued that total cost of `` restoration and replacement'' should be required. Under some guidelines, the value of a seal might be as little as $ 15 because that has been determined as the value of its pelt, while a seabird such as the puffin might be merely $ 7.88, the environmental lawyers said. Other plaintiffs in the suit which was filed last year are the Environmental Defense Fund and the states of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Read My Lips: No More Smooching Under Daylight Rule, School Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEDERLAND, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials have embraced a `` Daylight Rule'' to ban kissing and other affectionate displays between students, but the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says the rule smacks of violating constitutional rights. The daylight rule, which means daylight must be visible between students, was enacted at <ORGANIZATION> Nederland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> last week. About 270 students, grades 7 through 12, attend the rural mountain school west of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, which offers many teen-agers their primary meeting place. `` As a faculty, we just got tired of saying things to kids about kissing in the hallways,'' said teacher <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaro </PERSON>. Students who violate the rule get a written warning; a second offense merits a letter to parents. A parent-student conference with school authorities is required for the third. Further discipline is not specified. <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools Superintendent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON> said the rule is the school's prerogative. However, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, regional legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said discipline beyond notification of parents could threaten constitutional rights of privacy and freedom of association. `` As soon as they start to discipline somebody, then we at the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> will take the matter very seriously,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Tuesday. Students said they resent the crackdown as a violation of basic human rights that will only drive them into surrounding forests. `` I think the teachers are going way too far,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, 16. `` I'm friends with a lot of girls. And now I ca n't even touch them. `` I think it's kind of dumb,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, 16, who had been caught with the arm of <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, 17, around her shoulders. The teacher `` told us to be careful. ... But -LRB- <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> -RRB- goes, ` I'll put my arm around my girlfriend if I want to. We got written up.''

 A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was arrested and held in jail for more than 24 hours earlier this week on charges of possessing marijuana, the command said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, a civilian employee of the public affairs office at the Southern Command's headquarters, was arrested Monday afternoon on returning from a family outing at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, the command said.

The command, in a brief statement, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had filed a protest with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' treatment, alleging several violations of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaty. They include a failure to honor the American request for transfer of custody within 10 hours of detention; not notifying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities within two hours of her detention; not allowing access to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular or military officials, and not allowing <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> legal representation on request.

 Arms dealer and financier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, once reputed to one of the world's wealthiest men, appeared as prisoner 67391 in police mug shots published Wednesday in Swiss newspapers. The photos of <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, 54, were dated April 18, the day he was arrested in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warrant charging he helped hide assets that deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> allegedly stole from their country. The photos were apparently leaked to the press, and <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities have launched a judicial investigation to determine whether their publication was illegal, according to <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>'s investigating judge, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tschaepaett </PERSON> <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> police spokesman, confirmed the photos were from police files but said they had not been officially published. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s attorneys say they plan to ask <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s highest court this week for his immediate release. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they will ask for <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s extradition to face racketeering and other charges A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court has indicted him for allegedly posing as the owner of art and property that the Marcoses allegedly plundered from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted as president. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> also was allegedly the main middleman and financier in the Iran-Contra affair and has been involved in several kickback scandals. His name also has been mentioned by <PERSON> Pamella </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON>, a former call girl and researcher in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> whose sex and scandal memoirs involving rich and powerful men around the world were serialized by the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloid. One installment contained lurid tales of sexusal encounters with <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, with a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> prince and with a cousin of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s leader, Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. In its Wednesday editions, the Swiss tabloid <PERSON> Blick </PERSON> quoted a local government official as estimating that <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s stay in jail costs taxpayers $ 55 a day, excluding meals. `` The billionaire has never before lived so cheaply,'' the newspaper said. Swiss officials say <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> receives no special treatment in the downtown <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> jail which is reserved for people in pretrial preventive detention. His cell measures 30 square feet and is furnished with a bed, table, chair, sink and toilet. He can wear his own clothes and order out for meals. His jail cell is near the luxury Schweizerhof hotel where he was staying before his arrest. He has had some of his meals delivered from the hotel.

 Free speech took on new dimensions outside the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building Wednesday as the explosive issue of abortion rights turned a normally placid scene into a `` people's park.'' The court's stately, marble edifice served as the backdrop for demonstrations that led to some arrests, a crush of reporters and television cameras recording both spontaneous and planned news conferences, and competing rallies that spilled over to the nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol grounds. Inside the courtroom, lawyers discussed in measured tones the constitutional right to privacy and a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law restricting abortions. Outside the building, the arguments were less formal as more than 200 demonstrators and onlookers milled about. `` Not the church, not the state, women must decide our fate,'' chanted a group of abortion rights demonstrators. They later switched to: `` One, two, three, four. Open up the clinic doors. Five, six, seven, eight. You ca n't make us procreate.'' Far-outnumbered `` pro-life'' forces responded in kind. A group unfurled a banner saying, `` We pray for equal justice under the law for the babies.'' A few feet away a cluster of black anti-abortion activists chanted, `` Abortion is wrong. Slavery was wrong.'' Some `` pro-choice'' protesters _ including members of a group supporting the rights of AIDS victims _ broke through police barricades on the building's front plaza. Twenty-seven were arrested on charges of unlawful entry for crossing police lines. Their hands were bound behind them and they were led off singly or in pairs. A few went limp and had to be dragged off. Activists on both sides of the abortion fight circulated among reporters, offering their views on the potentially momentous legal battle taking place inside. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I'm feeling very up.'' But she said her optimism is tempered by the current court makeup. There are four new justices since the court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, three of them appointed by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We're very concerned about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> influence on the court,'' she said, adding that a ruling upholding the Missouri regulations, while not banning abortions, could `` end access to abortions for the young and the poor.'' A stream of speakers filed to a bank of microphones on the court plaza when the morning argument session ended. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON>, general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said opponents of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law `` are seeking to expand the right to abortion. The question is whether the court is ready to make that right more absolute.'' Next in line was <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, who had just completed his arguments opposing the Missouri regulations. Cutting through any legalese, <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said he would offer `` a sound bite'' to sum up his views that the court should reaffirm its historic 1973 decision, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. `` Roe works,'' <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said. `` You can not put the cork back in the bottle. You ca n't turn the clock back 16 years.'' Some people arrived at the court as early as Tuesday afternoon hoping to get one of the 40 or 50 seats inside reserved for the general public. Hundreds had to be turned away. First in line was <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Schranke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> engineering student who arrived at the court at 3 p.m. Tuesday. `` I believe that God is the creator and man has no right to take a life <PERSON> God </PERSON> has created,'' <PERSON> Schranke </PERSON> said. `` The baby has to have the choice.'' Some 400 people _ including more than 100 journalists _ were in the courtroom. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> foreclosed the possibility of a larger audience, sticking to the court's traditional policy banning television cameras or radio equipment Four of the justices' wives and numerous other special guests attended the session. In the public section sat <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, the `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>'' whose legal challenge of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ban on abortion led to the 1973 landmark ruling. In recent years, many arguments have had a relaxed, conversational tone. But there were few smiles among the justices Wednesday, clearly reflecting the political stakes. Seven of the nine justices asked questions. Only Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, author of the court's 1973 ruling, remained silent throughout. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> spent part of the time perusing a foot-high stack of legal briefs on his desk. They included the views of a record number of `` friend-of-the-court'' participants, tangible evidence of the public concern generated by the case.

 The importation of millions of baseball-style cloth caps from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not threaten material injury to the American headgear industry, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The commission voted 6-0 to reject an `` antidumping'' petition filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Headwear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, representing 32 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> enterprises. The petition sought to establish that the Chinese caps were being sold at an unfairly low price that threatened harm to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers. If the commission had approved the petition, additional duties of about 20 percent would have been added to the price of Chinese-made cloth caps, hats and visors. The commission found that $ 367 million worth of the headgear covered in the case was sold last year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, half of it imported. Chinese shipments last year, representing 28 percent of the value of all such imports, amounted to 78,468,000 caps and visors with an import cost of $ 51.5 million. Even more came from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which accounted for 31 percent of the imports, while 27 percent of the foreign-made headgear came from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cap manufacturers, employing 4,895 people, are scattered about the country, with many concentrated in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the commission said.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers accompanied by tanks, missiles and rockets paraded through <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Wednesday to mark the 11th anniversary of the communist coup, but fears of guerrilla attacks kept celebrations to a minimum. The parade was held a day early to avoid attacks. As it passed through central Eidgah Square, insurgents fired a rocket into the capital. Later, as the parade was ending, Moslem guerrillas who had moved into an abandoned village about 15 miles from the capital fired on troops along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, which leads from the city to the Soviet border. The two sides exchanged fire for nearly eight hours, with helicopter gunships attacking the village and soldiers firing artillery on the mud-and-stone compounds. There were no reports of casualties. The observance of the Saur -LRB- April -RRB- Revolution that installed a Marxist government was about one-fifth the size of last year's parade, military officials said `` We did it for security reasons. We did n't want to take any chances,'' said one officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. Many in the capital seemed aware of the observance, and the area around the central square was sealed off. Hundreds of soldiers from the army, air force, special guard and commando units as well as military training schools paraded past the reviewing stand where President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and other political leaders stood. The parade included dozens of freshly painted Soviet-made tanks, rocket launchers, howitzers, rockets and long-range Scud missiles. Absent were diplomats from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Those countries shut down their missions in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> shortly before the Soviet pullout, citing concern about the military's ability to defend the capital. The Moslem insurgency began soon after the April 1978 coup. Soviet military forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one Communist government with another and stayed to help fight the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and Pakistani-backed guerrillas On May 15, 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under a U.N.-mediated accord.

Minutes later, Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> was up on the roof hugging the iguana. She insisted she had bought it for her husband, a real-estate developer. Both agreed it would adorn their horse farm near <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The iguana's sculptor, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fe </PERSON>, had hoped his friends would bid on it. But they had stepped out to buy some beer and when they returned the iguana was sold. Everything was sold except for four cans of nacho cheese sauce. The kitchen sink sold for $ 50.

 Advocates of food irradiation called on Wednesday for widespread use of the controversial processing technique in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help prevent health risks from infected poultry and other food. `` It is estimated that nearly 40 percent of the poultry sold in this country contains deadly salmonella bacteria,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothbard </PERSON>, president of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a Washington-based group promoting food irradiation. <PERSON> Rothbard </PERSON> told a news conference that `` this bacteria infects more than 2 million Americans annually and is responsible for at least 2,000 deaths each year.'' He said irradiation can be effective in dealing with salmonella bacteria as well as other micro-organisms, parasites and insect pests in food which present `` serious health risks.'' Opponents of food irradiation contend that the process creates new chemicals in food, some of which may be harmful. They have also voiced concern over potential nuclear contamination of the environment from radioactive isotopes _ cobalt-60 and cesium-137 _ which are used in the irradiation process. <PERSON> Rothbard </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> has already adopted legislation banning food irradiation and `` a similar bill is likely to pass the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> legislatures. Many other states are considering similar measures.'' He said his organization was launching `` a national grass roots program designed to educate citizens and government officials about the benefits of this safe technology.'' <PERSON> Rothbard </PERSON> contended that opponents of food irradiation have relied on flawed scientific studies and used `` scare tactics'' to block widespread use of the processing technique. The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow describes itself as a newly formed non-profit group that `` promotes free-market and safe technological solutions to various consumer and environmental concerns.'' <PERSON> Rothbard </PERSON> said the group's funding comes from individual contributions, foundations and corporations, but he declined to provide details about specific foundations and companies involved with the effort. Also appearing at the news conference was <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Josephson </PERSON>, a biochemist representing the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization based in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, supported by 28 professional societies involved with food and agriculture. `` There is no single confirmed piece of evidence that eating irradiated food can be harmful to health,'' he said. <PERSON> Josephson </PERSON> said that while food irradiation currently is being used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only to process spices, elsewhere around the world it is being utilized with 14 foods in 20 countries including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Liles </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> was planning to introduce in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> within the next few days a bill that would rescind a 1986 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> permitting sale of pork and certain vegetables that have been irradiated The legislation also would call for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether food irradiation is safe. Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, is planning to introduce a companion bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sharin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that in fall 1987 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for clearance to propose use of irradiation on poultry. To date, however, the department has received no response from the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, she said. In January 1986, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> approved the use of low-dose irradiation on fresh pork to sexually sterilize microscopic worms, to prevent them from multiplying within the body and causing the disease trichinosis. Groups opposed to food irradiation include the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irradiation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosgofian </PERSON>, the organization's director, said last July that scientific studies showing adverse effects have been ignored or suppressed. One study, he said, found chromosome damage in humans four weeks after they ate freshly irradiated wheat. `` Irradiation of food actually changes the food, rearranges its chemistry, creates new chemicals, many of which are toxic,'' Mosgofian said. `` Irradiated food has been shown repeatedly to produce adverse effects to both animals and humans who consumed it.''

 Sitting in the audience as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments on abortion Wednesday was <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cleaning woman whose case brought the 1973 landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision legalizing abortions. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, has emerged from anonymity to enter the public fight over abortion and to argue that the decision she won should be preserved. `` I'm very overwhelmed,'' she acknowledged, seeming a bit bewildered as she met with reporters away from the hectic scene of demonstrators outside the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, 41, answered questions with great difficulty, stumbling through a nine-line written statement and later questions. But assisted by her attorney, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> disputed suggestions she has been used in the case and said she has stepped forward at considerable risk because she still believes in the cause of a woman's right to an abortion. `` Our law is in jeopardy for all the women of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` ... I have to protect <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, a feminist lawyer from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> since April 4, when someone fired three shotgun blasts into her <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> home as she slept, hitting windows and the front door. `` <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> feels that it is likely that the attack was made by a person or persons who oppose the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision and who wish to frighten her out of speaking about the issue,'' she said. `` She has also in the past been subjected to other forms of harassment.'' As a result, <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> was accompanied by security guards who checked credentials and searched some bags of reporters meeting with her. <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, said she agreed to become a test case in the legal challenge of anti-abortion laws when she became pregnant with a second child in 1970. She said she considered an illegal abortion and was revolted by conditions at a visit to a back-alley abortionist. But she did n't have an abortion. Instead she gave birth and put her child up for adoption _ without knowing even its gender. Her lawyer said <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> considered the experience `` far more traumatic to her than an abortion would have been.'' Yet <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> said she has recently begun efforts to locate that adopted child, whose conception triggered the landmark case. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, who says she is not assisting in that search, insists there's no irony or inconsistency there. `` The whole point is it's about a woman's right to choose,'' she said So what would <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, once <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, say to this child? `` Well, I obviously would n't discuss politics right away,'' she said. `` I'd just say, ` I'm your mom. How about a hug.''' <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> said <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> has only a modest income, cleans other people's homes for a living, and has a 10th grade education. A movie is being made of her life, and she is receiving money as a consultant on the project. She has also set up a <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Foundation </PERSON>, to finance her security and conduct pro-choice activities.

 The prime minister Wednesday presented parliament with three bills that would normalize relations between the communist state and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and guarantee the church autonomy. Passage of the bills, expected next month, will clear the way to establishing diplomatic relations between the <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> for years has refused to grant relations until the local church's status is resolved. Proclaiming the start of a `` new era,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> introduced the package in a speech to the 460-member Sejm, or parliament, that dwelt on the long, rocky history of church-state relations after communists came to power in 1944. The legislation was agreed to by church negotiators earlier this month. To a large degree it formalizes freedoms that the church had already won in practice for itself and the more than 90 percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 38 million people who consider themselves Roman Catholic. One bill defines the state's attitude toward the church as a sovereign organization operating within the constitution but free to manage all its internal affairs. A second bill grants equal rights to all denominations, bars discrimination based on religion and guarantees freedom of worship. The third bill entitles clergy to state old-age pensions. The bills were referred to an extraordinary committee pending the next meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> in May. `` It is a historical event,'' said Professor <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Stomma </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lawyer and former <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> deputy who participated in many of the early battles with the state over church issues. `` The negotiations were long because of political reasons, but now the situation is mature and it is a wise step on both sides, a great new historical fact,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, `` It will be up to historians ... to determine the scope of the responsibility and the fault of the sides which participated in the historic argument over the role of the Catholic church in the socialist system. Today we have those arguments behind us. We live in a different era.'' But he implied that much of the blame rested with the authorities. `` Generally, revolutions do not tolerate dialogue,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> noted that meetings between the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the head of the Polish church were so rare in the 1970s as to be `` sensations every time.'' But in the last eight years, he said, First Secretary <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and primate Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> have met 14 times. Contacts between provincial party leaders and local bishops also have become routine, he said. After World War II, communist leaders abrogated the prewar agreement giving the legal basis for church activities in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and the episcopate was forced to wage a constant battle for the church's survival in the years that followed. In the Stalinist-era drive to strip the society of religion, church properties were seized, heavy taxes were levied on parishes, seminarians were drafted into the army, bishops faced show trials and the unbowed primate, Cardinal <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyszynski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, was held under guard in harsh conditions for three years in 1953-56. Unions of `` patriotic priests'' opposed to the church hierarchy were set up, and PAX, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lay group loyal to the authorities, was created with the right to publish religious works. <PERSON> Wyszynski </PERSON> was released in October 1956 as <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomulka </PERSON> came to power, replacing the Stalinist <PERSON> Boleslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierut </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Gomulka </PERSON> continued a cold war against the church, virtually forbidding construction of churches and attempting to restrict the teaching of catechism to children.

 Fighting broke out Wednesday between groups involved in black market activities along the Cambodian border, and Western aid officials said at least 38 people were killed and 37 wounded. `` There was a big ambush on the trading route close to <LOCATION> Ta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phraya </LOCATION>,'' said one official, speaking anonymously. Another official said a group of traders was ambushed as it returned to the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> district from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` While many of them were running away from the gunfire, they found they were in the middle of a minefield. They got blown up by the mines,'' he said. The officials said 37 of the wounded were hurt seriously. `` We have truckloads of wounded and we have n't seen the end yet,'' said <PERSON> Urs </PERSON> <PERSON> Boegli </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The injured were taken to a hospital at the Khao-I-Dang refugee camp run by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boegli </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> recalled a third surgical team for the crisis and had blood brought up from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Officials said the casualties included Thais, but most were Cambodians living on the other side of the border. It was one of the most serious clashes along the border since the devastating 1984-85 Vietnamese offensive on the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance camps. Other details were not available. Ta <LOCATION> Phraya </LOCATION> district is in the eastern border province of <LOCATION> Prachinburi </LOCATION> and about 50 miles north of the key <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> Aranyaprathet </LOCATION>. Black market trading and clashes over it are rife along the border and involve Thais as well as Cambodian guerrillas and refugees in guerrilla-run camps. Three Cambodian guerrilla groups based along the frontier are fighting Vietnamese forces and troops of the government <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed there after invading the country 10 years ago. Also Wednesday, gunners continued recent attacks on Cambodian refugee camps just inside <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, hitting the Site 2 camp with heavy shells that seriously injured four refugees, a Western official said. Site 2 is along the border in <LOCATION> Prachinburi </LOCATION> province and with 180,000 people it is the largest U.N.-aided Cambodian refugee camp in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. It was not clear who fired the shells, which forced the evacuation of all but the most essential Western aid workers. The camp is controlled by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, shellings of the camps escalated as the two sides maneuvered in advance of diplomatic events. <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> is to hold talks in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> next week with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of the pro-Vietnamese government.

<HEAD>Political Appointees Taking Over Some Career Civil Service Jobs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressional report shows that political appointees are taking over mid-level federal jobs traditionally held by career civil servants, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman said Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., chairman of the human resources subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, released a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report showing that 64 political appointees in 18 agencies had recently been converted to career status `` The increasing number of conversions of political appointees into career positions is troubling, especially where ... -LRB- they -RRB- infiltrate mid-level management positions traditionally held by long-time civil servants,'' <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> called upon the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to implement some of the recommendations of the privately financed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has recommended among other things a decrease in the ratio of political to career employees. The commission, in recommendations submitted to the president last month, called for reducing the number of political apointees from 3,000 to 2,000. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that in its survey, which covered the last quarter of 1988, 42 agencies reported that they had not named any political appointees to career positions. Eighteen agencies reported 64 such appointments, 29 of which had actually been made earlier but not reported, said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Fifty-three of the appointments were made competitively and 11 were noncompetitive, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report. A task force of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in a report submitted to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, said, `` The more of these -LRB- mid-level management -RRB- positions that are converted to political appointments, the more civil servants are forced to recognize that they are in dead-end career tracks.'' In the report it submitted to the president, the commission said federal civilian employment `` has held remarkably steady over the past three decades, even as the number of presidential appointees has doubled, then doubled again.'' `` There is growing evidence ... that excessive numbers of presidential appointees may actually undermine effective presidential control of the executive branch,'' the commission said.

<TEXT>
 Anti-Senegalese violence in the Mauritanian capital has killed at least 26 people and injured 675 in the past two days, a hospital source said Wednesday. Soldiers patrolled the streets. Clashes stemming from a land dispute between the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> neighbors also have broken out in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s capital, and in many other cities and towns. But there has been no reliable word on the number of casualties outside <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION>. The roving mobs of shouting, club-wielding Mauritanians disappeared from <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION>'s streets Wednesday as army units patrolled the city. Mauritanian officials said residents respected the 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew imposed by President <PERSON> Maaouiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> ` <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Taya </PERSON> and there were no incidents It was not known when the curfew, imposed Tuesday, would be lifted. Interior Minister <PERSON> Gibril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallahy </PERSON> on Tuesday condemned the violence and called attacks on <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>'s Senegalese residents unacceptable. A source at <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION>'s main public hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 26 Senegalese and Mauritanians had died and 675 were injured. He said others may have died or been treated for injuries at the capital's other clinics and medical facilities. Other unofficial sources confirmed more than two dozen deaths and hundreds of injured. The government said it had no casualty report on the riots that exploded Monday and Tuesday. Violence has been spreading for two weeks since a border incident set off rising tensions over competing claims by Senegalese and Mauritanians to farm areas along the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms the border between the two nations. On Monday and Tuesday, angry crowds in the capital of 500,000 hunted down <PERSON> Senegelese </PERSON> citizens and beat them. Their shops and homes were sacked and burned. Police broke up the rioting with tear gas and clubs. The Mauritanians were angered by similar treatment of their compatriots in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, 375 miles to the south, Mauritanian Ambassador <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamal </PERSON> said 100 Mauritanian men and women had been airlifted out of the city Tuesday. Soliders and police using tear gas quelled anti-Mauritanian violence in the Senegalese capital early Tuesday. Both countries have reinforced their troops along the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as tensions mounted over the land dispute. Diplomatic observers said the clashes have shaken both governments. `` Neither of these governments can be comfortable with these events, and I'm talking about their stability,'' said one senior diplomat on condition of anonymity. Both nations have tried to calm tensions since Mauritanian soldiers allegedly killed two Senegalese farmers in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Diawara </PERSON> border village April 9 At least two people have died in violence in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> since then. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> straddles <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> north and black <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of its 2 million people are Moors of Arab-Berber extraction. The rest are black, mostly from the southern river region. Nearly all of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s 7 million people are black. The dispute concerns the right of Senegalese to farm on a <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> island. After both countries became independent from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960, the black Toucouleur people of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> continued to farm the Mauritanian side they had considered their own for generations. Moors to the north, traditionally nomadic herders, did not farm. But the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up new farmland, spurred Mauritanian interest in agriculture and prompted them to force Senegalese off the land.

<HEAD>King Admits Possible Errors, Says Elections Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Wednesday there may have been errors in the government's economic policies, and he appealed for unity and an end to riots over price increases. It was the monarch's first address to the nation since last week's unrest, which killed nine people. Speaking on state-run <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> did not name a new Cabinet to replace that of Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> resigned Monday because of the rioting. The king vowed to `` take all appropriate measures'' and promised to `` move in quick steps toward holding parliamentary elections.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has not had general elections since 1967, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which supplied half the deputies in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s now-suspended 60-member Parliament. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> last year severed links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and a new election law calls for a 72-member legislature elected wholly from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Many observers said the lack of a public voice in government fed frustrations and contributed to the riots, during which protesters called for <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>'s ouster and blamed him for falling living standards. `` Yes, there may have been a mistake here or a mistake there as a result of the endeavors of this official or that regarding the priorities assigned to internal development,'' he said. `` But someone who looks closely and fairly at these mistakes can not possibly see in them anything but minor forces compared with the extent of the straits we are facing.'' Four days of disturbances were triggered April 18 by increases of 10 percent to 50 percent in the price of gasoline, cigarettes, heating oil and other goods. The increases came on top of a steadily devalued dinar, which has severely reduced living standards. The rioting was the worst domestic violence in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> since the army crushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1971. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said his economic austerity program `` was painful.'' `` But to turn to violence, destruction, burning and killing is not a modern method of expressing discontent, and it is not a method which we know in our country, where all channels between citizen and official are open,'' he said. He noted that violence was aimed at government property `` such as health centers, water pumps and transportation services.'' `` Are n't we ashamed and sorry because we damaged ourselves, we the people of a stable nation, the nation of dialogue and development?'' he asked. The king noted that much of the nation's $ 6 billion debt was incurred to build up <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s armed forces `` on the longest confrontation strip with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He also alluded to the fact that other Arab states failed to provide much of the $ 12.5 billion over 10 years promised at a 1978 Arab summit. `` Was it a mistake to support our armed forces? Or is is a mistake to trust a brother who promised help, which is the promise which encouraged us to borrow?'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Scientific Center Planned For Chernobyl, But Atomic Data Still Withheld</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet television on Wednesday said a research center would be built near the site of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster, but a scientist said officials are withholding data on atomic energy three years after the disaster. In <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, people gathered in the main soccer stadium Wednesday night to mark the anniversary of the April 26, 1986 reactor fire and explosion, which sent a plume of radioactive debris into the atmosphere and killed at least 31 people. The mass meeting in the Ukrainian capital, 80 miles from the nuclear plant, was entitled `` Chernobyl should not be repeated.'' The evening news show Vremya announced that scientists worldwide would study at the new research center near <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. It did not say when the center would be built or specify its exact location. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that energy authorities still routinely censor sensitive information about the number of accidents, fires, fatalities and pollution of the atmosphere. Despite President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, strict limits remain on what can be disclosed about the nuclear power program, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Paton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, told the government newspaper. `` We can not obtain information about atomic and conventional energy, the number of accidents and fires at stations, breakage of equipment which causes material damage, losses of human life and even about the catastrophic pollution of the environment,'' he said. <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> said he wanted to publish excerpts of an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> decree in connection with the anniversary of the disaster, but the decree carried a notice banning publication of its contents `` in non-confidential correspondence, telegraph messages and those materials printed in the regular press or destined to be taken abroad.'' <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> criticized the policy that allowed ministry officials to determine what was secret. In an accompanying editorial, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> called on energy officials to end secrecy but noted: `` Unfortunately, and scientists confirm it with conviction, it is too early to speak about full glasnost in the field of atomic energy and the consequences of the -LRB- Chernobyl -RRB- accident.'' The newspaper said 116,000 people were moved from their homes in the contaminated area and $ 8 billion was spent in cleanup operations. `` Loss of human life, which can not be evaluated, and loss of faith in atomic energy are just the top layer of problems which we all face after the tragedy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. A deputy to the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ukraine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kachalovsky </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, `` there is still not enough reliable information -LRB- about Chernobyl -RRB- and existing information is often distorted.'' The effects of the Chernobyl explosion are still being felt in the region surrounding the nuclear plant, which still has four reactors in operation. The weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said there were widespread rumors that people living in the region of Chernobyl would be allowed to buy individual Geiger-counters, but so far no such devices are on sale. `` In short, to stop all these rumors about the high rate of radioactivity, <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> counters should be available to everyone,'' the newspaper said. `` Any new project of building an atomic power station, even the existence of old ones, raises doubts of the people,'' it said. `` Only in the conditions of total glasnost and under public control can such tragic events like what happened in <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> can be prevented. That has to be remembered by everybody who is connected with the atomic energy field.'' A group of foreigners visiting Chernobyl Wednesday was told that scientists believe the destroyed reactor is cooling down, the television said. The report said a repaired section of the atomic station is scheduled to resume functioning on Friday.

<TEXT>
 An investor looking for a place to put $ 1,000 in 1984 might not have thought of the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> stock market, but if he had taken the plunge he would have found the average return on his investment at the end of last year to be $ 14,880, said a study published Wednesday. On <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, the average return for the four years _ the value of the stocks themselves plus dividents _ would have been a tame $ 1,910. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> showed the best average return worldwide in a study by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which looked at stock markets in both major money centers and 31 Third World countries. The corporation, owned by 133 governments, is the agency of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that lends to private industry. The corporation's <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sethness </PERSON> said the large gain in the value of stocks on the stocks on the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> exchange `` was all due to the instability until -LRB- former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> left.'' The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> exchange jogged along through 1985 without much change, despite the violent political campaign that led to the victory of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, but took off after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> flew to exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in February 1986. By June 1987, the average return on stocks had reached a level nearly 16 times the level of 1985. There was a sharp drop in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> when markets worldwide crashed in October 1987. But, by the end of last year, total returns were back almost to their peak. Returns on stock in the Third World seem to have little to do with a country's prosperity. According to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the average Filipino had an annual income of only $ 590 in 1987, a slight increase after a decline of several years. The country has an active Communist insurgency and a $ 30 billion debt. An investor in the market of relatively prosperous <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would have done well, but only a little more than half as well as in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. His $ 1,000 would have turned into $ 7,890 in the four years. In the southern African republic of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> headed by President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogabe </PERSON>, a professed Marxist, the return would have been only a little less, $ 7,320. The survey does not cover other countries where governments call themselves socialist but are experimenting with capitalism. <PERSON> Sethness </PERSON> said a market in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> deals only in what he considers preferred stocks, while in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> the trading has been largely in bonds. He reported that the Yugoslav government has been consulting with the corporation on the possibiity of opening a market but has not yet done so. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> turned in the best market performance in 1988 although the country has the Third World's largest debt and inflation was running at more than 1,000 percent by the end of the year. The hottest stock was <ORGANIZATION> Acesita </ORGANIZATION>, a steel company, which chalked up a return of $ 8,313 for shares worth $ 1,000 at the start of the year. As in any market, investors can lose their shirts on Third World exchanges. Stock prices were mostly down last year in southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, by 37 percent in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and by 25 percent in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Meter Maid Attacks Increase; Weapons Include Beer Bottles and Watermelon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attacks on the city's meter maids more than doubled last year, and now average about three assaults per week. They have been punched, spit on, pelted with beer bottles and run over. One angry parking violator smashed a watermelon over a ticket writer's head. A popular bumper sticker reads `` Meter Maids Eat Their Young.'' The hostility is palpable in this city where car owners feel the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led to an inalienable right to park where they please as long as they want. The problem is compounded by office towers that have shot up, bringing in more drivers, while the number of legal parking spaces has stayed the same. But city officials are cracking down on meter maid abuse. The 134 meter maids _ 30 of whom are men and all of whom prefer to be called `` parking enforcement officers'' _ are being trained to walk away from irate motorists, and are told to use their walkie-talkies to call for help. And the city is aggressively prosecuting offenders. `` Slowly but surely, the word's getting out that people ca n't beat up on meter maids any more,'' said Investigator <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, 34, one of eight officers assigned to protect the ticket-writers Still, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'s tales would discourage job applicants. On Friday, while a meter maid was writing a ticket, the driver looked straight at her, backed up over her foot and drove off leaving her prone on the sidewalk, he said. A few minutes later, the suspect came back without his car and was arrested, he said. `` It turned out he owed over $ 400 worth of parking tickets,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. He also recalled a drunk who swung a beer bottle at a meter maid, a motorist who ran over a meter man and sent him to the hospital, and the man with the watermelon. `` We had a couple of kids from a local college, after knocking a woman to the ground and hitting her, they spat on her and left,'' he said. `` I found this woman old enough to be my mother sitting on the sidewalk crying, with saliva dripping off her face. It was terrible.'' Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimino </PERSON> refused to allow meter maids to be interviewed for this article because `` they've had an awful lot of bad press'' in the past, a spokeswoman said But one meter maid buttonholed while she was shooing away a double-parked car Wednesday said she is harassed and insulted `` about 30 times a day.'' `` Just now a guy called me a bad name,'' she said, adding that once a man `` threatened to shoot me.'' The woman, who refused to give her name, said more police protection is needed. About 250 people have been prosecuted for verbal or physical abuse in the last two years, and the conviction rate has been close to 100 percent, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, the city's director of municipal security. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> attributed some of the increase in assaults, from 50 in 1987 to 134 in 1988, to stepped up enforcement, including round-the-clock parking patrols begun last year. The statistics also may be inflated by better record-keeping and increased reporting from meter maids, who for the first time are seeing their tormentors punished, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said. Deputy Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Rina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said the number of tickets written has increased only slightly. She blamed the attacks on more cars fighting for the available parking spaces, a problem that will only get worse when reconstruction of the city's Central Artery begins `` There will never be enough parking spaces in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for everyone who wants to bring their car in,'' she said.

<HEAD>USS Iowa Families To Get Expedited Benefits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The federal government will speed up the handling of benefit claims for the families of 47 sailors who died in an explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa, officials said Wednesday. `` The Department of Veterans Affairs and <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> have expedited the claims from these families and also are providing assistance to them to help them apply for the benefits,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>, a staffer with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. All 47 crew members who were killed April 19 when an explosion tore through a turret during a training exercise carried the maximum of $ 50,000 in life insurance available under a military policy administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Those checks should be mailed within a month, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizzi </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Veterans Affairs subcommittee on compensation, pensions and insurance. It usually takes 30 to 60 days to process monthly death benefit claims after the forms are filed by families, he said. `` I would expect benefits might be payable as early as June or July,'' <PERSON> Brizzi </PERSON> said, explaining that that estimate takes into account the time it takes the family to file for the claim in addition to the processing. `` They'll receive a lot of assistance here because this is an abnormal case.'' <PERSON> Holley </PERSON> said benefit claims also were expedited when large numbers of service personnel were killed in an airplane crash over <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, in the bombing of Marine headquarters in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and in the Iraqi missile attack on the USS Stark. Aside from the insurance payment and monthly benefit checks, the families will receive six months' salary from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. The military also will pay funeral costs. The families will receive educational benefits and health coverage as well, <PERSON> Brizzi </PERSON> said. A private fund-raising drive sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> office has collected more than $ 35,000, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, a company vice president. He said the money will be distributed to the families beginning this week.

<TEXT>
 South African-led security forces on Wednesday handed over 31 captured nationalist guerrillas to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials as part of efforts to get <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence process back on track. The guerrillas were taken by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials from the northern garrison town of <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION>, on the border with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Later, they were to be transported to bases of the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> People's Organization inside <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Territorial officials said four other captured guerrillas accepted an amnesty offered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and asked to remain in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The turnover of prisoners occurred a few hours before the South African army and police units were to be confined to their bases so guerrillas still at large could have unhindered passage across the border into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Radio stations, aircraft and police vehicles have been broadcasting recorded messages from <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> commanders telling guerrillas that by Wednesday evening, only <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces would watch the border. More than half of the 1,600 guerrillas who crossed into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> earlier this month have gone back, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Only a dozen have appeared at U.N.-monitored assembly points because security forces are nearby. About 290 guerrillas and 27 security force members were killed in fighting after the incursion, according to police. The conflict jeopardized the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan, which calls for elections in November that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win. South African officials says the 60-hour safe passage period will be <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s last chance to get its fighters out of the territory and into U.N.-monitored bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The fighters may return, unarmed, in a few weeks to participate in the U.N.-supervised election campaign. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win the election. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nekewaya </PERSON>, one of the guerrillas released Wednesday, said he and his comrades had been ordered to enter <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and report to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers. `` We did n't know there would be trouble ... but they -LRB- the security forces -RRB- shot and so we shot back,'' he said. `` Our aim was not to fight against anybody but only to give ourselves up to UNTAG -LRB- the U.N. force -RRB-.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, mostly operating from bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, have fought since 1966 to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 74-year rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also called <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and South African forces were to be confined to bases starting April 1, but there was no arrangement for <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters inside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The incursion prompted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to seek and receive <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> permission to let its military units leave their own bases to pursue the guerrillas.

<TEXT>
 Abortion opponents led by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a long-awaited courtroom showdown Wednesday to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling that women have a constitutional right to end their pregnancies. Outside, police arrested 27 abortion-rights activists, among a noisy crowd of people demonstrating on both sides of one of the the nation's most divisive issues. Those arrested were charged with crossing a police line. In sharp contrast, the hour-long argument session took place in a packed but hushed courtroom. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, referring to the ruling that legalized abortion. But <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> lawyer representing those who successfully challenged an abortion-limiting <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law in lower courts, argued, `` There can be no ordered liberty for women without control over their ... childbearing.'' Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> urged the court to restore the state's abortion regulations even if it does not reverse the broader 1973 decision, which was based on women's privacy rights Fried, a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official called back to government duty for Wednesday's session, argued, `` We are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of ... privacy rights which this court has woven. We are asking the court to pull this one string.'' <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> responded, `` It has always been my personal experience that when I pull a thread my sleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a thread he is after.'' Questioning by the justices was brisk but not as aggressive as it has been in many argument sessions of recent years. Seven of the nine court members probed the positions of the three lawyers in front of them. Only Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a strong supporter of abortion rights, and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, author of the 1973 decision, remained silent. The justices, who do not necessarily have to reconsider <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> in resolving the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> dispute, gave little indication as to how broad their decision will be. They are expected to announce their ruling by July. At one point, Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> _ a potential `` swing vote'' along with Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ asked whether the court must consider the nature of a fetus. `` Can you derive -LRB- a fundamental right to abortion -RRB- without making a determination as to whether the fetus is human life or not?'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> asked. `` It is very hard to say ... it must be a fundamental right unless you make a determination that the organism that is destroyed is not a human life,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> suggested. <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said an assertion that `` life begins at conception,'' as stated in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> regulations, is not a verifiable fact but `` a question verifiable only by reliance upon faith.'' Fried said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was not asking the court to end all protections for women whose lives might be endangered by childbirth. `` We are not here suggesting that the court allow bloodthirsty regulations,'' he said. When asked by <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> whether he thinks there is `` a fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or not,'' Fried said, `` I would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract terms.'' Even if the court rules on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion regulations narrowly, the decision will be viewed as a barometer of the current justices' commitment to the 16-year-old ruling in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. The three justices appointed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> _ are conservatives generally considered skeptical about the legitimacy of the earlier decision. The justices will take their initial vote in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case Friday in a closed-door meeting only they attend. They will discuss their views, beginning a process that will include drafting and redrafting opinions. In an attempt to sway the justices, Americans in record numbers have been writing and telephoning the court to express their views. Tens of thousands of letters arrive each day, and the court's two switchboards were so flooded with calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated. The `` Roe'' of the 1973 ruling, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, was in the audience for Wednesday's arguments. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cleaning woman has emerged from anonymity to enter the public fight on the side of abortion rights. In <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor. The court said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to protect fetal life only in the third trimester _ 24 to 28 weeks into the pregnancy when the fetus can survive outside the womb. Recent scientific advances have called into question some of the cutoff points in the decision. A federal appeals court, relying on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, struck down five provisions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law as unconstitutional: _ A ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for performing abortions not necessary to save a woman's life _ A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or assisting an abortion _ A ban on using tax money for `` encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions _ A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus older than 19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb, by determining lung maturity and other testing _ A declaration that the `` life of each human begins at conception.

 Legislation to improve the transportation of coal from mines to distant power plants through the construction of pipelines cleared the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. The committee approved the bill, the Coal Pipeline Act, on a 22-13 vote. It allows coal pipeline companies approved by the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary to use the federal power of eminent domain to gain access to land so they can lay pipes. The technology has existed for years to use pipes to transport coal mixed with water. The bill covers such `` slurry'' pipelines as well as those in the future using other media, such as natural gas, to transport coal. The railroad industry has opposed the legislation. Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, D-Ariz., who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said pipelines could carry about 70 million tons of coal annually, while total coal production each year for the next two decades is expected to be about 275 million tons `` It is difficult for me to understand how the railroads will suffer loss of jobs when there will be at least 200 million additional tons of coal for them to haul,'' <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> said. He said other countries, like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, have jumped ahead of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by building coal pipelines, using the technology developed here. `` This legislation will increase our energy security, create new jobs, and provide much needed competition in the coal transportation market,'' he said. The bill requires that the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary determine that pipeline construction is in the national interest before approving use of eminent domain for any pipeline construction company. It also says construction could occur only if state water laws and other regulations allow it. <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> said the major issue that has stood in the way of the bill in the past has been whether jobs would be lost. An amendment added to the bill at the suggestion of Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa., requires that pipelines be constructed only with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> made products unless those supplies are 20 percent more expensive than products from abroad <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, who sponsored the bill, emphasized that construction and use of the pipeline must not damage the environment. The legislation has not been taken up yet by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Researcher Says South African Arms Industry Relies on Pirates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which once had access to top-line arms technology, is now dependent on pirates and arms smugglers to update its military weaponry, the author of a new book on the South African arms embargo said Wednesday. <PERSON> Signe </PERSON> <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said the embargo hindered, but could not stop, the growth of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s power. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> imposed a voluntary arms embargo Aug. 7, 1963, which was made mandatory in 1977. Restrictions were further tightened in a 1984 resolution urging countries to boycott South African arms exports. The embargo was defeated for many years through cheating or exploiting legal loopholes, said Ms. <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON>, whose book `` Embargo Disimplemented'' was published Wednesday. `` All <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s military technology was imported from the very same nations which took part in the embargo,'' she said at a seminar on her book. `` The general conclusion can be one of a long history of failure. That's correct if you look at each individual sale,'' she said. `` But I see very visible effects of this embargo.'' She cited <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s refusal to deploy Mirage aircraft in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> last year for fear of losing any to anti-aircraft missiles. Equipment problems could have been `` a contributing factor to the decision to withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>,'' she said. The study argues that no matter how inefficient, the embargo remains one of the few military sanctions that can be imposed on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and is valuable as a political statement condemning the country's apartheid system of racial segregation. Ms. <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> also said that a growing interdependence in developing new technologies and greater adherence to the embargo are factors making <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> increasingly vulnerable to the sanctions. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is more and more isolated,'' she said, noting that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, one of its stronger allies in recent years, had distanced itself from <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. `` It is left completely in the hands of private smugglers, with all that that implies in terms of insecurity,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON>. In the latest example, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police last weekend broke up an alleged plot by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to hand over to a South African diplomat parts of a stolen British-made Blowpipe shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile. Last year, West German authorities uncovered an attempt to smuggle submarine blueprints to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has announced plans to build its own submarine by 1992. Ms. <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> estimated that buying smuggled weaponry on the black market and pirating their design cost the South Africans three or four times the normal price. As a member of the British <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the 1950s had state-of-the-art equipment. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stopped their open sales of equipment after the first embargo. `` The West Europeans fell all over each other to conquer a part of this lucrative market,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON>. `` After the Europeans came <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It is pointless to look for one scapegoat. We are all part of the South African market,'' she said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> launched an arms manufacturing program by 1961, and the embargo `` was a belated attempt to stop a development which already had begun,'' she said. In the book, Ms. <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> said the ban had the countereffect of spurring the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to further develop their arms industry. But it also deprived <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> of modernized weapons systems, restricted its access to technology and curtailed the supply of spare parts. Smuggling operations are hidden by creating dummy companies, using phony labeling, diverting shipments to new destinations at sea or in midflight, and forging end-user certificates, the book says. But legal avenues were more important for building up the industry, it says. By the time the embargo took effect, South African had 120 foreign licenses to produce weapons. Before the arms ban became obligatory 14 yeas later, the <ORGANIZATION> Armaments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Armscor </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was legally producing weapons systems like the French Mirage jetfighter and the Israeli <PERSON> Reshef </PERSON> gunboat armed with the Scorpion sea missile. The embargo also is circumvented legally by importing civilian products which have military applications, such as electronics and telecommunications gear, the study says.

 <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it plans to offer a commercial-free daily news program for schools that would give teachers an alternative to the ad-supported Channel One service tested recently by <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. Turner Chairman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> would begin providing the daily 15-minute news show, called <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsroom </ORGANIZATION>, Aug. 14. The show would be carried on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> before dawn each school day and could be recorded for later use in the classroom. A teacher's guide would also be available each day with tips on how to use the programming. Several cable system operators, including <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Intercable </PERSON>, joined <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> at a news conference to express support for the program and pledged to see that schools in their areas each were equipped to get receive the show. The three operators serve about a third of the estimated 50 million homes with cable nationally. Whittle plans to provide an average of $ 50,000 in video recording equipment, television monitors and satellite dishes to each of the schools participating in the Channel One daily news program. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the decision of how much equipment to provide schools so they can receive his program would be left up to individual cable operators. The <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based Whittle is evaluating results of a 25-show test of Channel One completed last week in six schools and hopes to decide by mid-summer whether to expand the program nationally. The tentative date for national service is the fall of 1990. Whittle plans to pay for the equipment and the programming by selling up to two minutes of commercial time in each 12-minute show. Schools are required in exchange to run the full show for the entire student body each day. In the test, ads were run for shampoo, candy bars, jeans and sneakers. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he had a last-minute change of heart on the issue of advertising, and decided to ban it altogether after hearing complaints from educators at a meeting that preceded the news conference. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>, said he told <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> that he found any kind of advertising objectionable on a news show for schools. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> and has overseen the development of Channel One, said in a statement following <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s announcement that `` we wish the cable industry the best of luck in its endeavor to bring free news and information programming to schools.''

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will accept elections in the occupied territories only after Israeli troops withdraw and only under international supervision. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does not accept elections in the shadow of the occupation,'' said <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, No. 2 to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s largest component group, <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 For baby boomers who watched her in reruns, for fellow comics who sought her counsel, for former presidents and television executives still in awe of her, Wednesday was the day to say it once more: `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, 77, died unexpectedly at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> eight days after surgery to repair a ruptured aorta near her heart. She was recovering well, eating, taking small walks and, of course, joking. But the aorta ruptured again in a different spot and Miss Ball died despite efforts by intensive care unit doctors and nurses at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. On <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>'s Walk of Fame, flowers were placed on Miss Ball's star. <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who worked with Miss Ball on three television series _ `` Here's <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' `` The <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' and `` Life With Lucy'' _ reflected on how many mourners Miss Ball had. `` I think my grief, although it is deep ... is nothing compared to the grief her family must feel, and in her case, the entire world,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. `` Oh, what a blow! What a shame! Damn!'' lamented fellow comedian <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>. `` She did n't deal in jokes. She dealt in human behavior. She was a great physical mime with all the instincts of a -LRB- Charlie -RRB- <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>.'' Comedian <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, 93, said he shared the shock, and related her death in show business terms: `` What can you do? When the guy knocks on your door and gives you back your pictures, you got ta go.'' `` To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing,'' said `` Saturday Night Live'' comedian <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who at 30 was born two years after the `` I Love Lucy'' show went off the air as a regular series. `` She did n't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life.'' `` No matter how many tears we shed today, the laughs outnumber them. I love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' said actress <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of `` Golden Girls.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosati </PERSON>, a neighbor who stood for a few moments outside the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home Miss Ball shared with husband <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, said he was watching a rerun of `` I Love Lucy'' on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words `` In Memory of <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, 1911-1989'' appeared. `` I felt I had lost someone in my family,'' said <PERSON> Rosati </PERSON>, 40. Television and film actor <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> recalled getting a personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for his work on the TV series `` Taxi.'' `` It made it like it had been blessed,'' he recalled. `` Working with <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.d. in comedy,'' <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> recalled in a statement. `` What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime.'' <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, whose `` Make Room for Daddy'' series was shot on the Desilu lot, traded guest appearances with Miss Ball for decades. `` She was the best female clown that ever lived, no question. ... <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> did everything _ jumping in a barrel of cement, light her nose, eat candy off the conveyer belt.'' Actress-comedian <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>, costar of the `` <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>'' series, said she was among the scores of comics influenced by Miss Ball. `` Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do, but it could n't be helped, because I memorized her shows,'' Ms. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> said in a statement. `` She set a standard of television comedy for everyone to follow,'' said `` Tonight Show'' host <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>. Many took comfort in preservation of Miss Ball's talent through television reruns. `` God has her now and, thanks to television, we'll have her forever,'' said comedian and longtime friend <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> is gone, but she'll always be with us,'' said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` All those wonderful things they did together ... those wonderful TV shows ... are still available,'' said comic <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> will always have a special place in our heart, and she will live on forever,'' former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Nobody is going to take her place and nobody can compare with her, really,'' said actor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>. Miss Ball `` will always be the first lady of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>, who headed the network when it began running `` I Love Lucy'' in 1951. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, ending a short meeting with reporters, said: `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was mourned Wednesday by the western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hometown she left for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> more than half a century ago. `` It is a sad day for all of us. But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Garifi </PERSON>, organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that was to have been held next month. `` She was always so full of life,'' said <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopus </PERSON>, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her. `` It seemed like she would just go on forever.'' The 77-year-old comedian died of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where she was recovering from emergency heart surgery last week. The American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> office was deluged with calls from Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s fans who wanted to make a memorial donation, officials said. `` We just ca n't process as many memorials as we've received,'' said office manager <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lax </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was born Aug. 6, 1911, in this city of 40,000 people about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist. She grew up in nearby <LOCATION> Celoron </LOCATION>, a rural hamlet on <LOCATION> Chautauqua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. Friends said some of the characteristics of her most famous role _ the zany, excitable star of television's `` I Love Lucy'' _ were evident during her childhood. Mrs. <PERSON> Lopus </PERSON> said Miss Ball dreamed of fame, either as a dramatic actress in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or as a dancing girl in musicals. At age 15, she worked as a barker at a local amusement park, screaming pitches for popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice. In high school, she starred in high school plays and made her first appearance before a large audience at the now-defunct Palace Theater here. As a model, she caught <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION>'s eye and in 1933, she was off to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Although the comedian had n't visited <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> since 1956 and had no family there, she regularly donated money to charities, civic events and <ORGANIZATION> Jamestown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said Mayor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was to have received an honorary degree from the college at the homecoming scheduled for May 20. Residents had hung posters saying `` <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loves </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucy </LOCATION>'' in storefronts and house windows. After she fell ill last week, residents signed the posters and sent them to her as a get-well greeting. They sent more than 150 posters with 10,000 signatures. The honorary degree will be awarded posthumously, said <PERSON> Garifi </PERSON>, who is community relations director at the college. <PERSON> Celoron </PERSON> had planned to rename a street in Miss Ball's honor during her visit, and still plans to rename it as <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodell </PERSON> of <PERSON> Celoron </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Goodell </PERSON> said that when the group was formed about a year ago, `` We sent an invitation to <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> to be a member, and she sent back a check for $ 500 for a life membership.''

 Officials have launched a criminal investigation into the use of tear gas by soldiers who rushed thousands of people demonstrating for independence in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Wednesday. But the spokesman, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON>, denied that tear gas or any other chemical substance used by the soldiers killed anyone in the April 9 clash in the southern republic's capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. The denial contradicted reports by the Georgian minister of health, <PERSON> Irakli </PERSON> <PERSON> Managarishvili </PERSON>, that at least two of the 20 victims died from the gas and several others died from asphyxiation that may have been induced by the unidentified substance. At least 1,100 people were injured in the melee, in which soldiers charged the rally with sharpened shovels. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in remarks carried Wednesday by the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling Politburo ordered `` that everything that happened -LRB- in the clash -RRB- be thoroughly investigated.'' `` But it's already clear now that we should all use political methods and the force of law not to permit a repetition of anything similar,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in the closing speech at a meeting Tuesday of the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In his first direct statement on the <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> clash, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the incident showed that party leaders must improve their communication with the masses. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> told a news briefing that the investigation is being carried out by the chief military prosecutor. `` Due to the fact that tear gas was used on demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, a criminal case has been opened,'' he said. He said none of the victims had died from tear gas or other chemicals. `` When autopsies were performed, the reasons for death were not the use of chemical gas or chemical substances,'' he said. The announcement of the inquiry came one day after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denounced the use of poison gas on demonstrators and urged the Soviets to investigate what happened during the confrontation. Officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have confirmed only that tear gas was used, but doctors treating injured protesters in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> said they were suffering from a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by an unidentified chemical substance. One of the victims, <LOCATION> Gilo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oniani </LOCATION>, spoke with foreign correspondents in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on Monday on a trip arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oniani </PERSON>, a 34-year-old mother and factory worker who was sprayed in the face with an aerosol, told reporters she was unable to sleep due to nervous agitation and unable to eat due to pain in her abdomen. <PERSON> Manana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, wife of jailed protest organizer <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview Wednesday night that two men came to Mrs. <PERSON> Oniani </PERSON>'s room late Monday and threatened her for speaking to reporters. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said a commission made up of scientists from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and other major cities had been formed and would join in the investigation of the clashes. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said the the inquiry would take some time. `` There are contradictory versions around the events in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>,'' he said, including the question of how many gases were used. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that soldiers used a harmful gas and said `` some people died from poisoning.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday identified a chemical used against the protesters as an incapacitating agent dubbed `` cheremukha.'' Its main ingredient is chloroacetophenone, the newspaper said. A Western military attache in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said the substance was similar to but stronger than tear gas. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> first began April 4 when protesters criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Other protesters have demanded <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of alleged interference from the central government. The republic's senior party official, <PERSON> Dzhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON>, took responsibility for the April 9 attack and resigned.

<HEAD>House Democrats Assail Bush MX-Midgetman Missile Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's plan to develop both the MX and Midgetman missiles came under attack Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, with a handful directing their criticism at the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman for dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> without their consultation. Lawmakers said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> proposal of $ 1.2 billion funding in fiscal 1990 for the rail-based version of the multiple-warhead, MX nuclear missile and $ 100 million on the single-warhead Midgetman sounds the death knell for the latter program. `` It's not a two-missile package in reality. It's really a one-missile package,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., who referred to the plan as `` a sucker deal. `` If you go through with those figures you might as well kiss the Midgetman missile good-bye,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had recommended moving the nation's 50 MX missiles from silos to deployment on railroad cars rather than developing the Midgetman. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and scores of congressional Republicans have favored the MX. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose quick deployment of the MX and research-and-development funding for the Midgetman. Democrats, including <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, supported the Midgetman and urged <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> to include funding for the missile in the Pentagon budget. About a dozen <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats met with <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> to express their opposition to the MX-Midgetman plan and their displeasure with his efforts to arrange a deal without their advice. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., charged that when <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> worked out a deal on strategic weapons with <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> he was not representing the `` united <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opinion. Another <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, said a `` deal of this nature should not have been cut without full consultation of the Democrats.'' `` We are grandstand observers,'' he said. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since 1985, said he was `` speaking for myself. I was talking for my own point of view.'' The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat said he sought assurances from <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> when the defense secretary testified Tuesday before the committee that the Midgetman would not be `` squeezed out.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> argued that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiators need both the MX and <PERSON> Midgetman </PERSON> as a bargaining chip with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in strategic talks, and said he made that point with his colleagues after <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> left the meeting. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat claimed the position was a brand new one for <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. The Armed Services chairman played down the meeting, rejecting suggestions that the session was `` cantankerous.'' <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> called the session `` healthy ... there might have been some disagreements.'' But <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said the meeting was `` loud'' and <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> indicated that when members told the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> chairman that `` consultation is different than notification,'' there was `` some testiness on that point.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, asked if the meeting signals a rebellion among the party, said: `` It is not a rebellion. It is a reminder to him -LRB- <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> -RRB- that he was never authorized to make this kind of deal.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since 1985, was voted out of his post in 1987 by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats angered by the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> congressman's support of the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. He later rallied and won back his chairmanship. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was one of the liberal Democrats who supported <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who attended the meeting, said those in attendance, which included members who have worked on arms control and <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s selection, were unhappy with the chairman's failure to consult them `` Nobody thought we were given a proxy for this. We were very upset that there was arrogance that they had this deal,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Democrat, who has expressed an interest in the chairmanship, said the `` tom toms are beating.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering, in reviewing invalidated provisions of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, whether to alter its 1973 ruling in <LOCATION> Roe </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> that women have a constitutional right to abortion. In 1973, the court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor. The court said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester only when the fetus can survive outside the womb. The court said that occurs sometime between 24 and 28 weeks. A federal appeals court, relying on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, struck down these provisions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law as unconstitutional: _ A ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for performing abortions not necessary to save a woman's life and a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or assisting an abortion _ A ban on using tax money for `` encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions _ A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus thought to be at least 20 weeks old weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb, by testing for weight, gestational maturity and lung capacity _ A declaration that the `` life of each human begins at conception. In arguments Wednesday, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's lawyer, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, focused on the 1973 decision while <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> emphasized the state law's provisions. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, representing opponents of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, urged the justices to uphold the appeals court ruling. Fried said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said: `` States have effectively been forbidden, not only to prohibit abortion, but usually to regulate abortion in any significant way. ... We contend that the government is certainly not obligated ... to become an advocate for abortion.'' <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said: `` There can be no ordered liberty for women without control over their ... childbearing.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> called the political opposition in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> traitors on Wednesday. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and as such de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, is not running for president in May 7 elections, but is actively campaigning for the government coalition. While talking to hundreds of local leaders Wednesday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> quoted an article in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report as saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is spending $ 10 million to help the opposition in the Panamanian elections. The story, appearing in this week's edition of the Washington-based weekly newsmagazine, said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered the expenditure. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have declined comment. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said accepting the money amounts to `` betrayal by the unpatriotic Panamanians.'' The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Panapress </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the $ 10 million is part of a $ 120 million program the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has promised to the opposition. Opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> has denied the reports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financing. `` We have not asked for, nor received, nor will we ever receive any money from foreigners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or any other power,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` Now none of them -LRB- opposition -RRB- can say that they have n't received $ 10 million. We do n't know to whom they gave it, but we know they have it.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said in answering a reporter's question that differences with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are `` no more than the reincarnation of provocations since we signed that wretched treaty'' for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in 1904. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> pressed Panamanians not to retreat from the 1977 agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under which control of the waterway reverts to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999. `` Not one step back,'' the general declared. He insists that problems with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are based on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans to break that treaty and refuse to turn over the canal. U.S.-Panamanian relations have been poor since February 1988, when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> orchestrated the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s head of state <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him on drug smuggling and money laundering charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied the charges. American election observers have announced their intention to watch the Panamanian balloting, but <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has complained about their presence.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A package of federal relief measures to help farmers in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and other states recover from the current dry spell that has gripped parts of the nation's midsection was announced Wednesday by Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. `` Rain is what these states need, but I ca n't guarantee that,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` However, I trust the assistance we are able to provide will help.'' The assistance included permission for qualified farmers to graze livestock and cut hay on land taken from production under conservation portions of this year's crop programs. Livestock and poultry producers also will be able to buy surplus grain owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at half price. In a related program, CCC will help pay feed cost for farmers who must purchase more than usual amounts of feed for livestock. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he had directed the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to respond within 24 hours to requests from the agency's state offices for drought aid. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the aid package is essentially the same as <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> made available in the 1988 drought, which spread by summer throughout most of the nation and cut last year's harvests sharply. Asked if there were significant changes from what was offered last year, <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said, `` Not really, it's pretty straightforward.'' <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said that while <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> is expected to benefit greatly from the emergency assistance, farmers in a number of other states are expected to be eligible, including <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Others are expected to qualify, too, she said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also announced that a 1989 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> drought task force has been established, headed by Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, who oversees international affairs and commodity programs. The action followed <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s visit April 14 to the hard-hit winter wheat drought area, with Sens. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION>, and Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief meteorologist, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>, told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that except in the central <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, the weather outlook for crops has improved greatly. `` Conditions are much more encouraging than in 1988,'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said. But he said the damage from a February freeze and lack of spring rain has caused irreversible damage to a large part of the winter wheat crop in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> panhandles, west <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said he expects a more normal distribution of summer rainfall and a weather pattern favorable to the spring planting that is beginning.

<HEAD>Panel Backs Bill To Overturn Restrictive Policy On Soviet Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on Wednesday endorsed legislation that would ease the way for Soviet Jews and Pentecostalists seeking refugee status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The legislation seeks to undo a change in <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy last summer that substituted case-by-case review for the previous practice of allowing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> all Soviet Jews and evangelical Christians on the grounds they were suffering from religious persecution. The bill's author, Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., said he hoped the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would act on its own to undo the action of then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> But, if Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> does n't act, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said, `` We'll push the bill through.'' The committee approved the legislation on a 5-4 vote. The legislation states that both Jews and Pentecostalists have been persecuted by the Soviet government and should be granted refugee status automatically. The bill, which would be valid for only 17 months, to give time for a longer-term solution to be devised, would also grant automatic refugee status to residents of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> wishing to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> restricted the refugee flow to deal with a growing flood of Soviet Jews, Armenians and Pentecostalists taking advantage of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s liberalized emigration policies. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on immigration, refugees and judicial reform, called <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision `` an overkill'' that placed unnecessary hardships on thousands of Soviet citizens wanting to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 5,000 of an estimated 30,000 Soviets who have applied since Oct. 1 for refugee status have been turned down. The rejections, as well as an unprecedented number of applicants, have created a backlog of more than 20,000 Soviets waiting to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. To counter the growing backlog and respond to the increasing number of applicants, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> proposed legislation earlier this month that would allow the administration to admit 30,000 people as special immigrants to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> every year. Jewish groups contend <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s proposal would absolve the administration of having to pay for the Soviets' resettlement _ as must be done for refugees _ and would send a signal to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now accepts Soviet human rights policy. `` We have people suffering, waiting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and wondering if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is going to change his mind,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. He said the matter was `` obviously not a high priority for the administration.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one of four Republicans to vote against the bill, argued that the administration was nearing the start of consultations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on raising the ceiling of refugees allowed into the country. The administration has been saying since February that it would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for additional refugee slots beyond the 94,000 approved for this fiscal year to take care of some of the Soviet overflow.

<HEAD>FCC Rules on Murdoch's Ownership of Boston Newspaper, TV Station</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday granted media executive <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s request to transfer his <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> TV station to a trust in order to comply with FCC rules barring ownership of a broadcast station and newspaper in the same city. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, in a 3-0 vote, said <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could turn over UHF station <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> owns the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, to trustees <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor. But the commission said that in order to assure the station was properly `` insulated'' from <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and his affiliate companies, which include the 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> film and TV operations, <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> could not have approval of any possible sale of the station. The commission also said the station could have `` no communications'' _ that is, it could not use _ Fox programming or be an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> network of stations. At the same time, the commission denied two competing applications for the license of <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION>. The commission said its no-communications standard for broadcast trusts `` was well established when Twentieth bought the station -LRB- in 1986 -RRB- and that any communication between the trustees and any Twentieth affiliate, no matter how limited, is prohibited.'' However, the commission allowed the station to use syndicated programs for which it previously had contracted until the existing contracts expire. `` This action, as a practical matter, will end the station's ability to remain a <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> affiliate and to acquire programming from <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> on an on-going basis,'' the commission said <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> called the provision barring continued affiliation `` a harsh result,'' but said precedent was well established regarding the overall provisions of trust transfers. <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> has 60 days to comply. It also could ask the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider, appeal to the courts or ask for a commission hearing on the conditions. Or it could divest the property. Attorneys for <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Under terms of the transfer, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> will relinquish control but still receive any profits. The trust will expire if <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION> shares are sold, if the station stops operations or if the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> is sold. If the station is sold, the trustees must try to sell the shares to one buyer and the price must exceed $ 35 million. The station has been valued at between $ 30 million and $ 50 million. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> engaged in a bitter battle with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 over his ownership of the two <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> media outlets, as well as his ownership of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and WNYW-TV in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sens. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., had pushed a measure through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> late in 1987 prohibiting the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> from eliminating or modifying the cross-ownership rules and barring it from extending any waivers to the rules The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> at the time, which had been editorializing against <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, called his congressional action `` a vendetta.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had given <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> a waiver allowing him to own both <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> outlets until June 30, 1988. A federal appeals court overturned the congressional action, but <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> decided to seek <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> permission to transfer the station to the trust. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> gave him another extension while it considered the request. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, through his Australian-based <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owns extensive newspaper holdings in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

 Here is a brief look at some of the comments made Wednesday during <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> arguments in a case in which the justices are being asked to overturn the court's 1973 decision that said women have a constitutional right to abortion. `` First, we are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of unenumerated and privacy rights which this court has woven in -LRB- previous -RRB- cases ... Rather we are asking the court to pull this one thread,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, for those who challenged the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, disagreed, saying: `` ... he -LRB- Fried -RRB- does not seek to unravel the whole cloth of procreational rights but merely to pull a thread. It has always been my personal experience that when I pull a thread my sleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a thread he is after. It is the full range of procreational rights and choices that constitute the fundamental right that has been recognized by this court.''

 <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said: `` I think the basic question ... whether this is a human life or whether human life begins at conception, is not something that is verifiable as a fact. ... Both sides would agree as to when a heartbeat can first be detected. Both sides would agree as to when brain waves can first be detected. But when you try to place the emotional labels on what you call that collection of physiological facts, that is where people part company.''

 Two of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading food manufacturers offered a $ 170,000 reward Wednesday for information leading to blackmailers who have put glass shards, pieces of razor blades, thumbtacks and caustic soda in baby food. H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and Cow and <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> offered the joint reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the culprits The companies said they received blackmail demands but would not elaborate. Since April 7, 28 incidents of tampering involving baby food have been reported, including 11 on Wednesday, the government said. At least three people have suffered minor injuries. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said it was coordinating a nationwide police inquiry. `` It is difficult to imagine the twisted minds that could mount such a vicious attack on defenseless babies,'' Home Office Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. He said the government pledged to resist `` all attempts at consumer terrorism.'' The victims so far are a 9-month-old girl in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, who cut her mouth on a piece of razor blade, and two mothers cut by glass hidden in jars of infant food. None required hospital treatment. In one incident, sodium hydroxide, or caustic soda, was used to spike a jar of baby food. The white substance is a strong caustic base used in chemistry and oil refining. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that blackmailers apparently were trying to extort money from supermarkets and food companies. It said several major supermarket chains had received threats. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, whose parent company is the Pittsburgh-based food giant, and Cow and <PERSON> Gate </PERSON> said internal investigations determined their products were not tampered with during production. They said they would not submit to blackmail. <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> there were no signs the baby food had been infected during the manufacturing process and that police had `` considerable evidence of contamination at a later stage.'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> warned parents to be vigilant when feeding their children and said it shared parents' `` sense of outrage that a tamperer is prepared to target a victim as precious and vulnerable as a baby.'' It said stocks were removed from shelves and replaced in all incidents where tampered products were found. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, director of corporate affairs for H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said the parent company `` shares the universal outrage'' over the tampering. He said in reply to a question, `` We have no reason at all to be concerned about tampering of products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said the cases were limited to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A supermarket in the northwest city of <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION> removed all <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> products after a jar of baby food was found to contain slivers of glass, and other supermarkets said they were considering withdrawing all <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and Cow and Gate products. Spiked jars were first found in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the central cities of <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION>, but more cases have since been reported across southern and western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bradford-on-Avon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyndall </PERSON> said she cut her lip on a piece of glass as she tasted a jar of fruit dessert she was about to feed her 6-month-old daughter. In <LOCATION> Luton </LOCATION>, a mother who had heard news reports of the tampering said she cut her finger while checking a jar of egg custard intended for her 7-month-old daughter. `` As I took the second spoonful out it hit something in the food,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 24. `` I put my finger in to see what it was and a piece of glass cut me. `` I think they are out of their minds doing this,'' she said. `` At the moment my baby could be in hospital because of them. It is murderous. I am going to feed her on packet food from now on.''

<HEAD>U.N. Official Says Emergency Food Program Will Miss Target</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An emergency food program for war-plagued southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> will move less than half the needed grain before rains cut off outlying villages, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday. Relief workers began the $ 132-million <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operation April 1 with the intention of shipping 115,500 tons of food to locations around the southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> by mid-May. The rainy season begins then, isolating villages and making roads and airstrips unusable. However, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, the director of <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lifeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that only 37,000 tons of food had been delivered and 10,000 more tons would be distributed in the next 10 days or so. He acknowledged that the program would not meet its goal of moving 115,500 tons of food by mid-May. `` We clearly are going to fall short of that target, but we certainly will get more tonnage in,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> told reporters after returning from inspecting the program's progress. `` In short, everything is moving, but also everything is moving slower than we would have hoped,'' he said. Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> is seeking to stave off up to 100,000 anticipated deaths from starvation. Last year, as many as 500,000 Sudanese died because of famine caused by floodings and civil war. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said delivery of food will go on through the rainy season, but much of the grain will have to be stored at central distribution points. He said hunger will drive many remote villagers to the storage sites, compounding the problems of a population displaced by the fighting. The <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting the central government since 1983. The Christian and animist rebels want greater autonomy from the Moslem-controlled government in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. Among the difficulties Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has encountered are attacks on a convoy by tribesmen, a railroad strike, and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s refusal to allow shipments of food on its roads bordering <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Grain deliveries are now being divided about equally between rebel-held and government-controlled areas, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. He said both sides have agreed to let food convoys, trains, barges and airlifts pass through designated `` corridors of peace.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> directs, is coordinating the relief effort with the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, governments, and private agencies.

 Hundreds of rival soccer fans battled each other and attacked police Wednesday during riots on the day of the <LOCATION> Netherlands-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> World Cup qualifier. At least 23 people were reported injured. Fans also rampaged downtown before the game, hurling bricks at police and smashing windows. Police said they arrested 40 fans, mostly during fights outside the Feyenoord Stadium while the two teams were playing inside, according to police spokeswoman <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeters </PERSON>. She said rival fans attacked each other and battled police who intervened. About 1,500 fans were involved in that disorder, police said. Authorities deployed 600 officers, including 250 riot police, during the match for fear of a repeat of the stadium disaster in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, on April 15, when 95 people were killed in the crush of the crowd. Dutch fans had threatened to storm the 57,000-capacity stadium on Wednesday unless more tickets became available for the sold-out game. Some people believe such a stampede is what caused the deaths in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. Earlier Wednesday, police battled about 500 fans, some of whom hurled bricks and wooden sticks, in a downtown shopping neighborhood, police said. They said the rioters also looted a toy store and smashed dozens of shop windows. Police on horseback and riot officers with batons broke up the crowds. In one case, a police helicopter dived to within about 30 feet of a group of marauding youngsters. Dutch television said 40 people were injured, including three policemen. The discrepancy with police figures could not be resolved immediately. Wednesday's game ended in a 1-1 tie. After least year's European championship semifinal against <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> fans cheered their country's 2-1 victory with street revelry and open hostility toward the Germans. Some saw the win as revenge for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in World War II.

<TEXT>
 About 400 to 450 people rallied Wednesday at the state Capitol to protest Chippewa Indian treaty rights that allow them to spearfish off their reservations before anyone else is allowed to fish. While protesters gathered outside, more than a dozen business people from northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> urged state officials to do act on the spearfishing issue before the annual spring ritual permanentlu damages the tourism industry. `` Northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, be it just or not, is perceived as a fishless and a raciallly bigoted vacation land,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprister </PERSON>, a resort owner. `` You've got our lives in your hands. Do n't drag this thing out.'' The protesters object to the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> being allowed to leave their reservations and spear walleyed pike, muskellunge and other trophy-sized fish on public lakes before rod-and-reel season begins. The Indians' spearing season began Sunday and on Tuesday one band was met at lakes by hundreds of protesters, three of whom were arrested Tuesday. The Indians' treaty rights on fishing, hunting and gathering food plants were upheld in 1983 by a federal court. The businesssmen said they did not doubt the sincerity of Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> in trying to negotiate a settlement with the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION>, but that the public did not realize what they were doing. `` I'm sure you people are working night and day on this, but the perception is that nothing is being done,'' campground owner <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Vehrs </PERSON> said. `` The efforts are not in question here. It's the results of those efforts that we're not satisfied with,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Boulder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The 1983 ruling on the tribe's fishing rights came in a suit filed on behalf of the tribe 15 years ago. Parts of the suit, on such issues as timber rights, are still unresolved. <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> said public officials need the help of business leaders to convince the people of northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> that the case would take an additional five or six years to resolve in court, and that a negotiated settlement is the only way to quickly resolve the issue. Tribal members are expected to spear only about 30,000 fish this spring, compared with an annual hook-and-line walleye catch of about 800,000 fish annually in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> also said northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> was being falsely labeled as a racist area because of the protests against spearfishing. `` The fact is that there is racism, but it's by a very, very tiny minority,'' he said. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1983 that the rights the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> retained to hunt, fish and gather on public lands off their reservations in roughly the northern third of the state had not been extinguished by later treaties or other federal actions. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings have defined broad treaty rights for the state's roughly 18,000 Chippewa Indians, including the right to a `` modest'' standard of living from fish, game and timber on public lands.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> tearfully thanked God, his attorneys and the governor Wednesday on his first full day of freedom after spending 21 years behind bars in the poisoning deaths of his seven children. `` Free at last, free at last. Thank God almighty, I'm free at last,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said, borrowing the phrases that were immortalized by civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. A judged ruled late Tuesday in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town where the children died, that the former orange picket's 1968 trial on a charge of murder was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct and perjured testimony Retired Circuit Judge <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, assigned to review the case by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, released <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> to the custody of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 53, started his day with a stroll on the beach near the state prison where he spent much of his confinement, which included a harrowing stay on death row. `` It's a pleasure to walk on the beach, see the sunlight, picking up sand and dirt, kicking my feet in the water. I've never felt that in 21 years,'' he said. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, called her husband's release `` a miracle from God.'' Former comedian <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> has offered <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> a 10-year contract to work for him at his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> nutrition center, and discussions are under way for a feature-length movie on <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s ordeal. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> described the horror of being on death watch, having his body shaved and watching his coffin being built before his sentence was commuted in 1972, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the nation's death penalty statutes. `` You can almost taste the sense of death on your tongue,'' he said. He said he thought he was going to die during heart surgery 18 months ago. But <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said he feels no bitterness toward those who put him on death row: `` I do n't have no hate in my heart.'' The state has 10 days to order a retrial, but attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, whose 1971 book `` Arcadia'' claimed <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was framed, predicted the case will be closed. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> issued an executive order that leaves the final determination about a new trial to <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, the special prosecutor he appointed to review the case. The governor also encouraged Ms. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to continue her investigation into the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of officials involved in the prosecution. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> accused former State Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> of using manufactured testimony to railroad their black client in the trial before an all-white jury. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> denies there was anything improper in the trial and has filed a defamation-of-character suit against the two attorneys. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of orchestrating <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s release to feed `` the ever increasing demand for fictionalized stories from the news and closely allied entertainment industries.'' <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> did not receive a fair trial.'' Key evidence was withheld `` that could have changed the outcome,'' she said. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s lawyers and the special prosecutor presented testimony pointing to baby sitter <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> as a prime suspect. Ms. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, 67, is in an <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Two nurses filed affidavits last year that she confessed several years ago to poisoning the children, ranging in age from 2 to 8. The children died Oct. 25, 1967, hours after eating a lunch tainted with insecticide. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and his wife were working in a citrus grove eight miles away when the baby sitter served the lunch.

<HEAD>More Than 200 Excavated From Mass Grave</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Authorities excavated the bodies of more than 200 people who had been shot during <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule and buried in a mass grave outside <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, quoting from a report in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>, said the bodies of foreigners were among those found during four days of excavation at a site in the <LOCATION> Darnitsa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>. It did give the exact days for the excavation. The government has estimated the site contains from 6,000 to 68,000 bodies, but unofficial estimates said bodies of up to 300,000 people were stacked in the grave. A government commission in March found that the bodies buried at the site were those of victims killed under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressions, not by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> soldiers, as three previous official inquiries had ruled. The commission's conclusion in March supported testimony of elderly witnesses in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION>, who said they saw trucks that dripped blood rumbling to area in the 1930s, before the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> occupied the area. `` The personal belongings found in the mass graves will undoubtedly help clear up the <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> case,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, quoting the newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said gunshots pierced many of the skulls. It said the grave also contained servicemen and civilians from other countries, citing evidence of foreign uniforms, footwear and toothbrushes. Earlier commissions on <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> had blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> for the killings even though villagers insisted the bodies were already there when the Germans occupied <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> in September 1941. The report blamed `` several generations of bureaucrats in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>'' with covering up `` Stalinist crimes'' at the site. The villagers broke five decades of terrified silence to accuse <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s secret police of the killings after the Ukrainian government erected a monument in May 1988 blaming Nazi occupiers for the crime. The villagers forced Ukrainian authorities in December to establish the commission. Western historians estimate 20 million Soviets were killed under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, particularly during the Great Purge of the late 1930s, but Soviet officials ignored the dark side of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for most of the past 50 years. The examination of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes begun briefly under <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and was revived in 1987 under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness. Western historians also blame the Soviets for the massacre of 4,250 Polish officers unearthed in 1943 in a mass grave 310 miles away in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, Polish authorities said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s forces killed the officials, although official Soviet commissions have blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. A joint Polish-Soviet commission is examining <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and other `` blank spots'' in Soviet history.

 House Democratic leaders pulled a $ 4.7 billion spending bill off the floor Wednesday after rebellious lawmakers rejected a plan to cut $ 1 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget to strengthen the war on drugs and finance other domestic programs. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, responding to defeat in the first budget test of the year, pledged `` corrective surgery'' that would satisfy disgruntled Democrats and Republicans. Leaders wanted to pay for the spending in the bill by curtailing defense, foreign aid and many domestic programs by $ 1.4 billion. But the effort failed when minority Republicans were joined by Democrats seeking to protect their favorite programs from across-the-board cuts. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who offered the spending-cut amendment, said the vote was a sign of the divisiveness of budget issues and not a signal that the Democratic leadership was weakened by the controversy surrounding <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his personal finances `` I do n't think it reflects on leadership problems,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` This is not a vote of confidence issue.'' One of the 92 Democrats who voted against their leaders' plan was Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said he opposed the across-the-board cuts because they would have sliced too deeply into the programs he oversees. `` From our point of view, we were battling the loss of about $ 100 million from science and space,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s proposal would have produced $ 1.4 billion in savings by shaving .57 percent off most government programs. The provision would have produced cuts this year of $ 1 billion in defense, $ 353 million in domestic programs and $ 43 million in foreign aid. White House budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> had sent lawmakers a policy statement in which he said he would urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to veto the `` fiscally irresponsible'' measure. And in a letter to House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the defense cuts would force the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to stop paying re-enlistment bonuses, reduce training hours, eliminate five to 10 construction projects, lay off scientists and engineers and curtail weapons testing `` This would have very serious consequences for the manning of our forces,'' he wrote, adding that he, too, would seek a veto. But loyal Democrats countered that the spending cuts were slight and could be dealt with by federal agencies. `` All we're talking about are revisions of .57 percent so we can cover some of the priorities we in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> think are needed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>. Looming over the battle was the veto threat from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which labeled the overall bill `` fiscally irresponsible'' and said the Democrats' proposed $ 1 billion in defense cuts would be too harsh. The legislation, deemed a `` dire emergency'' by its supporters, would provide money for the 1989 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Included would be $ 1.2 billion for veterans programs, $ 892 million for guaranteed student loans, $ 822 million for anti-drug efforts, $ 600 million for last year's forest fire costs. Republicans complained that the legislation would leave spending levels well above limits agreed to in a 1987 budget pact between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. They also said it would push this year's deficit even further beyond the $ 135 billion limit set in the budget. The 1989 shortfall is expected to surpass $ 163 billion, without counting this measure. `` If a satirist wanted a perfect lampoon about how the Congress of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes economic policy, if a cartoonist was looking for the biggest blubbering whale in the ocean to harpoon, if he wanted a model of a <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, they need to look no further'' than this bill, said Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass. The legislation was endowed with symbolic importance because of the recently concluded agreement between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders on next year's budget. Republicans argued that with work on 1990 deficit reduction just beginning, it looked bad for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to begin its work this year by boosting the 1989 shortfall. The ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, called the legislation `` the moral equivalent of banana republic fiscal policy.'' Democrats used some of the bill's spending _ such as its funds for new prisons, training for new law officers and other anti-drug measures _ as a test of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s willingness to pursue initiatives he has endorsed. `` If you're serious about dealing with the drug problem in this country, you'll vote yes,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the deputy House whip But Republicans argued that the drug expenditures, and other parts of the bill, could have waited until next year. `` It makes a good show, great charade, ` I'm for drug abatement and against abuse and all of that sort of thing,''' said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>. `` But I tell you folks, they've got more money now than they can spend.'' The $ 4.7 billion measure would also provide $ 423 million for state foster care programs, $ 250 million for reparations for Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II, $ 154 million for the homeless, $ 127 million for unemployment assistance, $ 100 million for refugee assistance, and $ 88 million for public housing. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has yet to consider the spending bill.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers reportedly shot and killed three Palestinians and wounded at least 63 during a general strike Wednesday in the occupied lands, and masked attackers killed an Arab accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, more than 80 Palestinian leaders in the occupied lands rejected a government proposal for elections leading to an interim peace plan. The leaders, many of them pro-PLO, said the elections were a ploy `` calculated to appeal to the media, to end the -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- uprising and to win time.'' They said only an international peace conference with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation can solve the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. Their signed statement was the first formal response by local Palestinians to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal. In another development, the leaders of five major Christian denominations in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> denounced <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s crackdown on the uprising, protesting what they described as `` excessive use of force'' and the `` unprovoked harrassment'' of Palestinians. The joint statement marked the sharpest criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders since the December 1987 start of the uprising. It was signed by the heads of the Greek Orthodox, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Armenian, Syrian and Anglican churches. Wednesday's violence occurred mostly in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a stronghold of the Islamic fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, which called the strike on the anniversary of the capture of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> by the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> in 630. The widespread clashes apparently were sparked by the death of <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, 16, who was killed by troops during a confrontation in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sabra </LOCATION> neighborhood, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed that <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> was killed by army gunfire. About 300 <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> residents _ some waving outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and chanting `` God is great!'' _ carried <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>'s body through the streets. Troops fired live ammunition to disperse the funeral march, wounding at least 13 Palestinians, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The violence spread, and 17-year-old <PERSON> Ammal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was fatally shot in the head by troops in the nearby <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp. An army official confirmed the death but said the circumstances were under investigation. At least 45 other Palestinians, most of them teen-agers, were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. They included a 2-year-old girl from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who was seriously injured by a plastic bullet in the head. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, 8-year-old <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aniss </PERSON> was fatally shot in the chest when soldiers opened fire on stone-throwers on the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp, Arab hospital officials said. A least five Palestinians were wounded in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> clashes, including a 9-year-old boy from <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> camp who was reported in critical condition with a plastic bullet in the eye. An army official confirmed 10 wounded in the occupied lands and said he was investigating the report of the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> death. He noted that in two cases bodies were taken by relatives for quick burial before army investigators arrived. The army usually lags hours behind hospitals in confirming casualties. Masked assailants carrying automatic rifles gunned down the alleged collaborator, <PERSON> Fayek </PERSON> <PERSON> Erar </PERSON>, at his home in the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atiya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. The 40-year-old property dealer became the sixth victim in a week apparently targeted for cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating. The PLO-backed leadership of the 16-month uprising declared Wednesday `` a day of accounting for the collaborators.'' The four deaths brought to 451 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising. Eighteen Israelis also have died in the violence. Also Wednesday, a Palestinian detainee was found dead in his cell at the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> detention camp, where hundreds of Palestinians are held without charge or trial. An army official said the man, identified as 21-year-old <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakut </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Bureij refugee camp, apparently was killed by fellow prisoners during a dispute. He did not elaborate. The Palestinian leaders called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` recognize the necessity of negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> within the framework of an international conference'' and described the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' `` sole legitimate representative.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for elections in the occupied lands to choose leaders who would negotiate an interim settlement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has ruled out talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from occupied lands and the formation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The Palestinians said they did not reject the idea of elections but wanted any vote to be part of an overall plan leading to Israeli withdrawal and Palestinian independence. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said Wednesday he understood `` the difficulty the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are having is with the fact that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan is speaking about an interim agreement and is not indicating anything about the final status.'' However, he said the plan's main objective is to open talks.

<TEXT>
 The government declared its support for the strained <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance Wednesday in a rebuttal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British officials dismayed by its call for early superpower talks on short-range nuclear arms. `` There has never been a German intention to pursue an independent course,'' chief government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> news conference. `` It is not our intention to jeopardize the alliance.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials have harshly criticized Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s decision to press for prompt superpower talks to reduce the number of short-range nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> described such negotiations as a `` dangerous trap.'' He said it would be a mistake to risk cutbacks in this kind of weapon while the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> holds an advantage in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Referring to criticism from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would restate his government's position when the two leaders meet in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Sunday. `` The chancellor will endeavor to explain the West German position again in an atmosphere of trust and friendship,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Tuesday harshly rejected <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal. She said short-range missiles are part of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy, which `` can not be undermined by any one country.'' However, the West German government, responding to domestic pressure and overtures from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, contends the climate is right to step up arms control efforts with the Soviet bloc. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should postpone a planned upgrading of short-range missiles while pursuing negotiations on reducing their number.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, defending President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against criticism he was moving too slowly in dealing with the Soviets, insisted Wednesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` doing just fine'' his first 100 days in office. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the first time since taking office, he had `` a lot more to learn'' from the former president. About what, reporters wanted to know. `` Life its own self,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I learned a lot in eight years, learned a lot about principle, learned a lot about the world as it really is,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In a gesture of respect, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s office, 34 stories high above <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, rather than have the former president come to him at a hotel suite. It was their first meeting since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Jan. 20 inauguration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to draw on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s knowledge about `` changes that are taking place abroad _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, all over the place _ and get his advice.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first months in office, told reporters, `` I think he's doing just fine.'' `` He was a major part of everything that we did'' during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eight years in office, the former president added. When a reporter mentioned that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been criticized for taking his time in returning to arms talks with the Soviets and opening contacts with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reiterated: `` He's doing just fine.'' Asked about <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, in which the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide said he believed he had <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s authorization for operating a clandestine scheme to arm the Nicaraguan Contras, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> both were `` in the same boat,'' in that they could not comment on the case <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also refused to criticize his one-time vice president for cutting back funding for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s once-prized Star Wars missile defense plan and for seeking humanitarian aid _ not military assistance _ for the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels. `` I think that I can rest assured that he means to maintain our national security,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said they hoped that arguments being heard Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would set the stage for outlawing abortion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hopes to tap <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for some missions or assignments in the future. He said he had nothing specific in mind but added, `` the respect for him -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- around the world knows no bounds.'' Nearing the end of a hectic four-day trip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later flew to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, then he was heading to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> where on Thursday he will participate in a series of events to highlight anti-drug efforts and also will dedicate an Alzheimer's disease center. Addressing issues dear to the hearts of Texans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a `` responsible'' savings and loan bill and said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was buying too much foreign oil. He told the lawmakers `` there is no place on Earth like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his adopted home state. `` Now, I'm no cowboy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I pitch horseshoes for a living but I do n't ride broncos.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' oil industry has been battered for several years by low petroleum prices. Moreover, the state has more failed savings and loans than any other. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said unemployment was at its lowest level in four years and that the energy industry was being depended upon less for jobs. `` Still, no matter how diversified and high-tech that we become, a strong domestic energy industry is important, still important, to the future of this state and, in my view, all of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I find it disturbing that nearly 50 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oil is imported,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a one-time oil man. `` This is not good for the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his position that the massive oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> should not lead to cutbacks in oil exploration. Conservationists have called for a ban on drilling in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` shutting down our domestic energy production is no answer and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil.'' `` We must and we will maintain a strong energy industry.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the continuing crisis of failures in the savings and loan industry was among `` the few dark clouds'' still on the horizon. The president praised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for acting quickly on an S & amp; L bailout bill and said `` I call on the House of Representatives to pass a responsible S & amp; L bill as soon as possible.'' He said his proposal includes $ 37 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` so that those who willfully abuse the trust of small savers can expect to be pursued, tried and, if guilty, put in prison.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flubbed a line in his speech where he was talking about hopes to `` conquer cancer.'' Instead, he said `` cancer conquer.'' He made a good recovery by referring to the speech given by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> ridiculing him during last summer's Democratic National Convention. `` <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> was right,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I kept putting that silver foot in my mouth.'' She was standing in the front row of the legislative hall and applauded along with the rest of the crowd.

 Two researchers who say they've used ordinary lab equipment to master fusion, the process that powers the sun and the stars, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday they will duplicate their experiments for government scientists in hopes of quieting skeptics. `` We have 19 experiments being set up now,'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including a demonstration of room-temperature fusion for scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said the federal scientists will monitor the experiment at <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, then dismantle it and take it to the national laboratory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for further tests. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and his collaborator, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, are making the arrangement to silence some of the skepticism about their claim to have discovered a way to achieve fusion using ordinary lab equipment assembled on a table top. Their announcement of cooperation with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> came after Rep. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrision </PERSON>, R-Wash., questioned them closely about why so many other laboratories have not been able to duplicate their results and asked if they would perform the experiment before independent observers `` We are very happy to tell people how we have been able to do it,'' said <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, but he added that those who ca n't duplicate the process should `` publish in full'' reports of their failures. Several other researchers have said their experiments appeared to confirm the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> scientists' endeavors. Rep. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said reports on the fusion process indicated that the energy levels achieved were low She asked <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> if they had actually achieved a `` useful temperature'' with the reaction. `` We've had a cell warm up to the boiling point,'' said <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, adding, however, that scaling the process up to a useful level, `` raises many new problems. `` We think it's feasible, but it will require a very high effort.'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleishmann </PERSON> announced their discovery March 23, stunning nuclear physicists around the world who have attempted to achieve fusion for 25 years using multimillion-dollar machines. The hearing was jammed with journalists, scientists and industrial representatives anxious to learn more about a reaction that some predict could produce plentiful electric power with little environmental pollution or threat. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> told the committee how he and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> had inserted electrodes of platinum and palladium in a flask containing deuterium oxide, or heavy water. Electrical current was applied to the platinum electrode, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said, forcing deuterium atoms into the crystal lattice of the palladium. He said that after the experiment ran for several hours, the deuterium became compressed and fused, giving off heat almost four times as great as the energy the experiment had consumed. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> researchers said they built their initial experiment for about $ 100,000, but <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said that `` production of a scale-up device will cost about 10 times that'' and that the next phase, producing enough energy to be useful, `` would cost millions.'' <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, appeared with <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and urged the committee to respond quickly to the fusion discovery by pushing for federal aid to establish a fusion research center at the university. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> legislature had allocated $ 5 million for the project and had collected more than $ 1 million in private donations. `` What level of funding do you believe is needed,'' asked Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. `` The figure that comes to mind is $ 25 million,'' said <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> Several committee members reacted favorably to his suggestion, but added that coming up with the money would be difficult in a climate of budgetary restraint. Other scientists who testified urged the committee not to rush to support of the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> research. `` We -LRB- scientists -RRB- need at least two months to evaluate the significance of this process,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fusion researcher. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miley </PERSON>, a fusion researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee that putting millions of dollars into the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment now could hurt energy research in general. `` A failure could set fusion research back by years,'' he said. `` I urge us to no overeact and put all our eggs in one basket.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltmarsh </PERSON>, head of the fusion energy program at the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, said his lab and other federal facilities have all tried to duplicate the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> process. `` The results have all been negative,'' he said. `` We have seen no heat'' generated by the process. <PERSON> Saltmarsh </PERSON> told the committee, `` It would be a real mistake to try to dray firm conclusions at this point.'' He said many questions about the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment still need to be answered before it is understood. One of the elements to be investigated, said <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, is the metal that can be used in cold fusion. The palladium used by the Utak researchers is an expensive metal that is available in only a few places on Earth. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said other experiments are under way to find if other metals can be used. `` Palladium may be the best choice but there may be also other possible choices,'' he said. Researchers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have reported what may be fusion reactions, but many other laboratories have reported failed efforts. Scientists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> reported experiments with reactions that may be fusion. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said follow-up articles detailing how the experiment is being conducted will be published in scientific journals. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said part of the controversy revolves around the different way in which chemists and physicists announce the results of their work. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments have come under heavy criticism from fusion experts because the precise details needed for duplication of the work have not been released. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said that physicists typically circulate a pre-publication copy of their research to colleagues for informal review. `` For chemists, it is done in a different way,'' he said. `` The review is left up to the journal.'' The March 23 announcement stunned the international physics community, which has spent millions of dollars over the last quarter century attempting to achieve fusion using massive machines filled with plasmas heated to temperatures of up to 100 million degrees. Many experts believe fusion to be the ultimate energy source. The nuclear process is the opposite of the fission reaction that now powers atomic generating plants. Fission occurs by splitting atoms and the process leaves behind highly radioactive spent fuel. Fusion derives its energy by forcing atoms of deuterium or hydrogen together. The reaction produces an atom of helium, a burst of energy and a neutron. Experts believe fusion energy would produce a much smaller amount of radioactive waste, and that fusion power plants could be operated with deuterium oxide, or heavy water, a chemical that can easily be extracted from seawater. Natural fusion energy is the power that causes the sun and the stars to shine. Stellar fusion is created when the massive force of gravity in stars forces hydrogen atoms to fuse, giving off heat, light and helium. Most `` hot'' fusion research is an attempt to duplicate the pressure and heat process seen on the sun.

 An incontinent, retarded 7-year-old with AIDS may attend public school and sit at a desk alongside other mentally disabled children her age, a federal judge ruled Wednesday. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had been told she could attend class only if she remained isolated inside a glass booth. Her adoptive mother, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, took her battle to court, saying she would not send her daughter to school to sit in a `` glass cage.'' <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> wo n't have to be separated from her 10 classmates under the ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvachevich </PERSON>, which the child's attorney thinks will have effects around the country. `` And she will be at class Thursday with bells on,'' said the attorney, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, after Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> ruled the child posed no significant health risk to other children. `` All she understands is she will be going in to play with some little people. She does n't know what school is; she has n't been to it,'' said her mother. `` The judge has finally entered a ruling. I am recommending it be followed,'' said school board attorney Crosby Few. `` The partition is a moot question now. There wo n't be one. She will be in the classroom just like the other kids. I hope this is the end of it'' Few said school officials had hoped to have a couple of days before <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> attended class. `` We had hoped to be able to educate the parents first ... to answer all their questions and inquiries before hand. The education will just have to come later.'' `` It's been a difficult time for all of us,'' said <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. He said he thinks school officials `` will be as glad as we are to put this matter behind us.'' `` There's been a great deal of misinformation in the case,'' he said, adding that he approved of a court requirement that the school system educate pupils and parents at <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s school about AIDS. The judge also noted that Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> did n't object to a one-on-one aide for <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> or a daily examination by a school nurse to determine if attendance is advisable that day. In December, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> sent the case back to Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON>, saying the child must be placed in a regular classroom unless evidence proves <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> posed a significant risk to other children through bodily secretions. Through affidavits and sworn statements, Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> said she learned <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> is `` capable of being instructed not to suck or mouth her fingers and that she is well on her way to being fully toilet-trained.'' The judge said she took that into consideration in making her decision as well as two other factors. The child's doctor told the court he does n't think the risk merits such precautions as isolation, and the pediatric association now makes no recommendation for a restricted environment for youngsters who can not control bodily secretions. Initially, Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> ruled Aug. 8 than <PERSON> Eliania </PERSON> could attend <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> but had to remain inside an enclosed plexiglass partition until she was toilet-trained and learned to stop sucking her fingers. <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school officials fought attempts to admit her. They feared she might transmit the deadly, incurable acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus through bodily fluids. But <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a nurse who adopted <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> as an infant in her native <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, isisted that to develop fully <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> needed to be with other children.

<HEAD>Measure Will Start National Trend, Proponents Predict</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An ordinance that would give unmarried or homosexual city workers equal standing with married employees will start a nationwide trend in both the public and private sectors, supporters predicted Wednesday. City officials are expected to approve the measure, which virtually redefines the family. Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> endorsed the measure at its introduction Tuesday, and eight of the 11-member <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> signed as sponsors. `` This is landmark: Putting into city law in the first major city in the country that lesbian and gay couples and unmarried straight couples have a right to dignity in their relationships,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkin </PERSON> of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. If approved, the ordinance would be the most far-reaching of its kind in the country, said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Coles </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> chapter, who spent more than a year helping draft the final version. The measure, broader than one approved in 1982 by city supervisors but vetoed by then-Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>, applies to 24,000 city employees. It is not known how many would be directly affected. The ordinance would ban discrimination by city agencies because of non-traditional relationships, and would extend many benefits _ like dependent health care and pension benefits _ currently provided only to married couples. It also would expand sick and bereavement leave for employees whose lovers or parents are seriously ill or have died. The ordinance would also formalize non-discriminatory policies already in effect, such as visiting rights for domestic partners at city hospitals and city jails, said <PERSON> Coles </PERSON>. The only policy in practice that has not been changed to accommodate non-traditional families is one that grants free passes to transit workers' spouses, he said. Controller <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yockey </PERSON> has determined that the provisions of the plan will not cost the city since city employees pay for dependent health benefits. Supervisor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, author of the original and the new version of the measure, defended the need for the legislation Wednesday. `` Society must not interfere with the basic relationships that make up our lives,'' said <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, who is gay. <PERSON> Coles </PERSON> believes the measure's biggest impact will be in the private sector. `` This will be used by private employers and private instutitions to finally acknowledge these types of relationships,'' he said. `` We know many have wanted to do this, but needed us to show them how and by what standards and under what conditions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that it is reviewing domestic partnership policies that can voluntarily be adopted by businesses. The chamber has not taken a stand on the ordinance. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON> said his office has been flooded with inquiries about the proposal from governments, citizen groups and companies around the world. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has about 158,000 `` non-family households,'' which includes roommate situations as well as committed non-marital relationships, said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, citing 1980 Census Bureau figures. The city has 140,000 family households. The only major opposition is expected to come from religious groups. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> said the church can not support `` any effort to weaken the institution of marriage, to tinker with it, or put any parallel system alongside it.'' The law would require domestic partners to have a joint home and share basic living expenses, although each could maintain a second home. They also must register with City Hall or, for those wishing confidentiality, with a notarized statement filed with a third party, such as an attorney. To put the measure into effect, the board will have to negotiate with 10 different insurance providers and with three unions which each have seats on the seven-member health board.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s information minister on Wednesday revealed details of what the Iranians say is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy operation in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, alleging the agents included military officers, clergymen and civilians, official reports said. In a televised news conference, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had `` carried out acts of terrorism and sabotage in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, including assassinations of high-ranking officials,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The dispatch was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` These spy networks were organized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to infiltrate the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> system and divert the revolution in the next decades,'' <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying the Iranian agents had been recruited by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> `` mainly from those Iranians calling at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies abroad for various purposes such as obtaining visitors visas to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said last week he had no information on the Iranian allegations. `` They make similar claims every once in a while about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spies when they need a little attention,'' he said. <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> said the agents all were linked to a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Weisbaden </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and an unidentified neighboring country of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in the operation. <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> identified 20 of the alleged agents, seven of them officers in the armed forces. He said they were only some of those who had been arrested. Among those named were three senior naval commanders who, according to unconfirmed reports from Iranian dissidents, were executed in early April for plotting to overthrow the government. <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> identified them as <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kianoosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakimi </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Ghahreman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadeh </PERSON>, and Capt. <PERSON> Touraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Riyahi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> did not say whether any of the accused agents were still alive or if they had been executed. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who broke the news about the arrests on Friday, said all the alleged agents were still alive and under interrogation. Though <PERSON> Resyhahri </PERSON> did not name the neighboring country accused of cooperating with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy operation, he read from the testimony of one alleged agent who said they were taken for training to another country via <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. He said agents in the armed forces had given the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> information about Iranian naval movements in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> said tens of agents had been arrested and that other arrests would follow in the coming weeks, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. But he said that if the agents identified themselves before being caught, their sentences would be shorter. Responding to a question from an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> reporter, <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> said the Iranian intelligence service, known as SAVAMA, learned about the alleged <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> network in 1985, but that the arrests were made only a few months ago. The alleged agents all passed lie detector tests before being recruited and were given regular annual training in espionage techniques, including the use of codes, development of photographic film, and use of special radios and cameras, <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> said. He said equipment used by the alleged agents, such as special photgraphic film and cameras were imported into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> packaged as medicine. The agents allegedly reported to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> about Iranian military sites, number of personnel in the armed forces and government offices, and military and civilian flight routes, <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON> named the head of one of the alleged networks as <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalvand </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Among the others was a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> expert on legal affairs, <PERSON> Bahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqaei </PERSON>, and another lawyer, named <PERSON> Manuchehr </PERSON> <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>. Two other spies included <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidvar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jamshid </PERSON> <PERSON> Amiri </PERSON>, both employed in the oil industry. The only clergyman among the group was identified as <PERSON> Heshmatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Maqsudi </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, the daffy comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted viewers for four decades, died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery. She was 77. The actress, star of the hugely popular `` I Love Lucy'' and related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries, had undergone major heart surgery April 18. She had been recovering steadily, getting out of bed and joking with the staff, but shortly before dawn Wednesday, she went into cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived, said <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>. She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 a.m. and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. `` There was nothing to indicate this would happen,'' Wise said. `` The heart itself apparently was not involved in Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s sudden death.'' In the 6 -LCB- - hour surgery at <LOCATION> Cedars-Sinai </LOCATION>, doctors replaced her aorta and aortic valve Although the replaced portion of Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s aorta did not apparently fail, the entire artery was in poor condition when she was operated upon, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kass </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kass </PERSON>, who performed the operation, said at the time the tearing in Miss Ball's aorta `` progressed all the way down into her abdomen.'' Miss Ball, with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail, was considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format. `` I and 100 million others will miss her,'' said comedian <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` But we have n't lost <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> because she's still with us on television and we can see her on and on.'' `` <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> possessed the gift of laughter. But she also embodied an even greater treasure _ the gift of love,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement. `` She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit. She was not merely an actress or comedienne. She was <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and she was loved.'' `` Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> institution,'' former President and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Just the mention of her name brings a smile. ... We love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and will miss her deeply.'' `` It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 years,'' said Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s frequent sidekick, <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. While in the hospital, the comedian was deluged with thousands of cards, letters, flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> and her late former husband, <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON>, starred in `` I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated reruns. The late <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON> played their neighbors, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON>. Her split-second timing, wide-mouthed wails and exaggerated pratfalls made the `` I Love Lucy'' show one of the most popular in television history. Bridge clubs and bowling teams changed their meeting nights to watch <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> cook up still another ridiculous scheme that would push their long-suffering husbands to exasperation. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewers _ more than for the inauguration of President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> _ tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> have <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>. The real birth occurred just four hours before the previously-filmed show was broadcast. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s singularity as a comedian was matched by her talent as a show-business entrepreneur. She and <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> established one of TV's first major independent studios. Desilu, as their production company was called, made some of the top comedy shows of the 1950s and'60s, including `` December Bride,'' `` Our Miss <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>'' and `` Make Room for Daddy.'' As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> signed an $ 8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1953 _ the largest in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch today. The couple stopped making weekly `` I Love Lucy'' shows in 1957. Despite riches and two children, <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, their marriage foundered, and the couple divorced in 1960. In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, who became her executive producer, and remained on TV for 12 more years in the weekly `` Here's <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'' and `` The Lucy Show.'' Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was born Aug. 6, 1911, in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, a brunette, was dazzled by the stage, but her ambitions were discouraged by an acting school _ `` They sent my mother a letter saying she was wasting her money,'' Miss Ball once said _ and she turned to modeling under the name <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Belmont </PERSON>. Her ads for <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> cigarettes caught <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s eye, and in 1933 she went to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. As a blonde, she appeared with the <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> in `` Room Service,'' with <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> in `` Follow the Fleet'' and with <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> in `` Stage Door.'' In all, she appeared in more than 75 movies. In 1940, her tresses colored the fiery trademark red, Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> met <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON>, a rumba star. They married within six months. In 1951, when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> decided to move her radio series, `` My Favorite Husband,'' to television, Miss Ball insisted that <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> be her co-star. But the network was n't sure <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> would be a hit with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public. The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved audiences would watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born band leader with a heavy accent. They also produced their own pilot episode on borrowed money. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> relented, and `` I Love Lucy'' was an immediate success. The show revolutionized television sitcom production in the days before videotape. It was filmed in advance before a live audience, employing three cameras instead of the traditional one used for motion pictures. The actress was last seen at the 61st Academy Awards ceremony March 29, where the svelte actress received a standing ovation and laughed freely throughout her brief bit with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>. Her last series _ `` Life with <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' once again co-starring <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> _ was carried by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> at the start of the 1986 season. But the show, her first series in 12 years, was canceled after less than two months when it drew spectacularly low ratings. She `` felt terrible. ... It really devastated her,'' daughter <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> said at the time. Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 TV movie `` Stone Pillow,'' considered one of the most challenging roles of her career. She was hospitalized for dehydration when it was over, but the movie was a minor critical and ratings success. Just this month, Miss Ball had signed a deal for a reported $ 750,000 with <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> to publish her autobiography. Said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> will always be the first lady of CBS. ... <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'s extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever.'' Funeral arrangements were pending.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a speech released Wednesday that shortages of housing, food and consumer goods are growing despite his reforms. He blamed runaway government spending and Soviets who `` forgot how to work.'' In one of his frankest admissions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s problems, he said citizens vented their anger March 26, when at least three dozen senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates were defeated in parliamentary elections <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said perestroika _ the program he launched four years ago to overhaul <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> economy and society _ remains the proper course, but reforms are not being put into effect properly, particularly at the local level. His harsh criticism appeared to set the stage for even more radical measures. `` The food problem is far from solved,'' the president said. `` The housing problem is acute. There is a dearth of consumer goods in the shops. The list of shortages is growing. The state's financial position is grave. He also blamed top party leadership. In an unusually pointed attack, he singled out those responsible for particular failures, such as importing millions of medical syringes with no needles. The construction industry, he said, `` has been shoveling billions of rubles into the ground and is creating actual ruins.'' He said building a factory to produce detergent is in its ninth year, while people face daily shortages of soap and detergent. Individual workers share the blame, he said. `` Many forgot how to work. They got used to being paid often just for coming to work.'' However, he said people `` respond badly to shortages and to queues, which take time and, to put it frankly, humiliate people.'' He spoke in a closing address Tuesday at a closed-door meeting of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not release the speech until Wednesday. The speech followed a housecleaning in which the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> swept 110 senior officials from leadership. Many had already retired or been ousted from posts entitling them to seats on the committee or its financial arm. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the session, `` The activity of a series of party committees and Soviet organs in their attitudes, in style and work methods, in their understanding of the processes taking place did not keep pace with life. ... This also relates to the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and to its Politburo. Many leaders were caught in an `` inertia of old thinking,'' he said. Retiring the so-called `` dead souls,'' many of them holdovers from the era of the late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, and promoting nearly wo dozen non-voting members named after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power to full voting membership helped strengthen the president's hand in pressing for further reform. The 58-year-old Kremlin chief paid tribute to those stepping down, calling their resignations `` a brave step'' that represented a shift to a new generation of party officials. He said that in light of the voting in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first competitive nationwide balloting, all levels of party and government must review their work `` so their activity meets the scale of the tasks being tackled by the country.'' He proposed that the Central Committee convene again before the first session of the parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, to review election results and set procedures for the new body. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> regularly complains about Soviet problems which for decades were routinely ignored or denied. But this time he went into considerable detail and said the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant disaster and falling price of oil _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s main export _ can not be cited as catch-all excuses. The explosion at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, killed 31 people and sent a cloud of radioactive dust into the atmosphere. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> blamed poor agricultural production on `` the work level, initiative and responsibility of local leaders.'' He said the problem became especially acute after the central leadership began delegating some power and decision-making to the local level. When people turn to local bureaucrats for help, they encounter `` the old atmosphere, where every visitor is looked down upon as being very nearly persona non grata, an undesirable phenomenon,'' he complained. `` This causes special resentment,'' he said. He said in many areas, the economy has deteriorated and shortages are increasing, in part because economic reforms were not fully thought out before being implemented. He said many problems can be traced to wasteful government spending. Economists project the budget deficit will amount to $ 162 billion this year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also noted crime has risen as society has become more democratic, especially in areas where nationalism is on the rise. He pledged a thorough investigation of the bloody April 9 clash between troops and pro-independence demonstrators in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` It's already clear now that we should all use political methods and the force of law not to permit a repetition of anything similar,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in his first public remarks about the incident.

<TEXT>
 A former senior federal housing official on Wednesday denied violating any ethics or conflict of interest laws when she became a consultant on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial trade activity with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> shortly after leaving her government post. Appearing before the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, former assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development, described her contacts with her former colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> as `` distinctly and definitely informational.'' She said her contacts with agency officials were not an attempt to influence their decisions concerning visits by Soviets in connection with a cooperation agreement in the field of housing and other construction. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> served as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for policy development and research from July 1984 until she resigned in October 1987. She was appointed in 1985 to direct commercial trade activities with the Soviets in connection with the agreement, making her responsible for organizing and managing an international trade show `` Stroyindustriya'87'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> sponsored about 110 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies at the event at a cost of $ 1.6 million which the Government Operations panel last year called `` misguided, mismanaged and misspent.'' During the panel's probe, several companies complained of being `` misled and pressured'' to participate in the show and questions arose about the propriety of the former housing official allegedly trying to solicit them as clients after leaving <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. After leaving the housing agency <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> became president of Construction, <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm providing assistance to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies wanting to do business with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. She also was hired as a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> consultant for six months, an agreement the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said was extended twice and terminated in January 1989. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> contended that she `` worked for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> consulting all of five or six days.'' `` This is not a case of a revolving door at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Crews worked Wednesday to repair cracks in an aqueduct one day after it was damaged in an earthquake that killed one person and shook an area from the capital to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast resort of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. Four people were injured in Tuesday's quake, which measured 6.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, but little major damage was reported. Cracks appeared in buildings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, and telephone, electrical and subway service in the capital were interrupted. The tremor felled a power line just north of the city center that electrocuted a man of about 30, said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, a city police spokeswoman. Water was being trucked to neighborhoods in the southeastern part of the city that were left without service because of the aqueduct damage. Officials said said residents of affected areas should have clean water again by Friday. Inspectors checked schools and some high-rise office buildings for damage. The movement set off landslides on a rural road near <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION> news service said. The epicenter of Tuesday's quake was 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, about 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION>. The tremor terrified people who recalled a 1985 quake that crumbled many buildings in the capital and killed at least 9,500 people. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

 Syrian soldiers fired rockets at the coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday, sending a ship fleeing from port and blocking the only escape routes for thousands of beleaguered Christians, police said. The sporadic bombardment coincided with renewed efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to halt the latest round in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war and arrange political reforms to give Moslems an equal share of power with the Christians. Police said the Syrians and militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fired their multibarreled rocket launchers from hilltop positions around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> overnight and during the day. Their fire targeted a 10-mile coastal stretch between <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos, the main ports of the besieged 310-square-mile Christian enclave. An unidentified commercial ship docked in <LOCATION> Amsheet </LOCATION> harbor just north of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION> sailed quickly out to sea when shells fell around it, police said. Army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian forces struck back with 155mm artillery fire at Syrian and Druse positions around Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported on either side. At least 272 people have been killed and 991 wounded, by police count, since the current round of civil war fighting broke out March 8. Two Cypriot-flagged ferry boats had been running the gantlet of Syrian and Druse shellfire in the past five weeks to evacuate more than 13,000 Christians from the blockaded enclave through <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>. But sailings by the <PERSON> Larnaca </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and the Baroness M were suspended Monday in a shipping ban imposed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> so that a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy tanker could unload 6,000 tons of fuel needed to reactivate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s shuttered power plants. Power was restored in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Tuesday for two hours a day, ending a 10-day blackout caused by lack of fuel at the capital's main power plants A convoy of 10 trucks carrying 35 tons of medical supplies from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> rolled into west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday, completing a three-day journey across <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohanna </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, said the aid would be split between Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> areas to ease an acute shortage of medicines in hospitals throughout <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers opened an emergency meeting on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and Secretary-General <PERSON> Chedli </PERSON> <PERSON> Klibi </PERSON> said a cease-fire must take effect before the country's problems can be solved. The ministers are discussing a peace plan for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that would include sending a multinational observer force of at least 200 Arab officers to monitor a cease-fire. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has given tacit approval to the dispatch of an Arab observer force `` as a first step'' toward ending the fighting. But he said he still intends to end `` the Syrian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of Lebanese territory.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains 40,000 troops in Moslem areas under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupies a border strip in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a buffer zone against cross-border raids by Palestinian guerrillas. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> also declared support for the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peace plan, saying in statement released Wednesday that an `` immediate end should be put to the horrific cycle of violence gripping <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Call For Conference To Halt Natal Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-apartheid leaders Wednesday called for a peace conference to end fighting between political factions in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province that has killed more than 1,400 blacks since 1986. Representatives of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions told a news conference that their affiliates in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> share a commitment with the Zulu political organization, <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, `` to a mass movement for peace.'' Crowds supporting the two sides fought in the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> town of <LOCATION> Mpophomeni </LOCATION> Tuesday, killing five people and injuring five. Police firing tear gas and birdshot broke up the battle and arrested 196 people, authorities said. Both sides agree the violence must stop, but previous peace initiatives have failed to halt the beatings, arson fires, and revenge killings that occur almost daily in Zulu townships and villages. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, who is not restricted from political activity even though his organization is banned, said affiliated community groups in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> had approved the peace plan. However, <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> said he was wary of possible government interference. `` It would seem to us that when we are on the verge of a major political initiative to break through the cycle of violence, the apartheid state has moved systematically to undermine the political process we are engaged in,'' he said in a statement. He referred to a speech Monday by Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> that blamed front supporters for the violence. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> predicted the peace efforts would fail and said church officials organizing the initiative were naive. The front is allied with the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> criticizes Inkatha's opposition to boycotts, sanctions and other confrontational methods of battling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of racial segregation.

<HEAD>Dubcek Appears On Hungarian TV Despite Prague Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hungarian television ignored a protest from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Wednesday and broadcast a second excerpt of a three-hour interview with <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reforms. It was the first official Soviet bloc interview with <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> since he was ousted as <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in April 1969. The 40-minute excerpt showed <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> making a spirited attack on <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who was Soviet president at the time. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982. `` It was <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s dogmatism that endangered socialism,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said, recalling a meeting three weeks before the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion in August 1968. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said he rejected <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> pressure to halt his reforms. `` I could not become the gravedigger of our new policies,'' he said. `` I told the Russians that we have the overwhelming support of the people.'' `` I want to make it clear that there was no counterrevolutionary threat,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said, contradicting the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s justification for the invasion. `` Yet they keep teaching this lie.'' He was referring to Czechoslovak history books still in use today. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s current president, <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, and current party leader, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, were among those most active in crushing <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s reforms. Many of the reforms initiated by <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> are similar to those now under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is slowly rehabilitating the leaders of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 1956 anti-communist revolt, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> last week ruled out <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s The first installment of the <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> interview was shown on April 17. On Wednesday, Czechoslovak media reported that <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vlastimil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrenberger </PERSON>, formally protested the April 17 broadcast, in which <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> attacked former Hungarian and Polish leaders for not doing more to prevent the 1968 invasion <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> spoke in Slovak, dubbed over in Hungarian and translated into English by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Hungarian TV is widely received in southern <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>, home to about 700,000 ethnic Hungarians. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was invaded by <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in August 1968. Wednesday's late-night broadcast also contained an interview with Yugoslav dissident <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON>, who was jailed in the 1950s and ousted from his senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> positions after challenging then <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>.

<HEAD>FCC Allows Phone Company to Test Cable TV System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday gave <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> permission to build a coaxial cable TV system and permission to test a state-of-the-art fiber-optic system that will allow customers to order movies every 15 minutes by phone. The ruling, which was watched closely by cable TV operators who fear entry of huge telephone companies into their turf, affirmed a preliminary decision last year to let <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> build and operate the coaxial -LRB- bundled copper wire -RRB- cable system in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>. GTE of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also provides phone service to <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said there had been no adequate bids submitted to the city of <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION> for cable service except from General Telephone. GTE is leasing the system to Apollo CableVision to provide programming. A <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will install a fiber-optic cable network to experiment with services such as near-video on demand, which will allow customers to phone in orders for movies that will be running on 30 channels. Some movies will begin every 15 minutes. Wednesday's decision was challenged immediately by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which said it appears to violate federal rules generally barring telephone companies from the cable TV business. Current rules bar phone companies from generating cable programming in the same areas where they provide telephone service. Federal rules also bar the seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> operating companies from owning cable services anywhere in the country, but allow companies like <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> to do so outside their service areas. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in July 1988 preliminarily voted to consider recommending to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that telephone companies be allowed into cable TV in the regions they serve. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also suggested it would try to encourge telephone companies to enter cable TV, even if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to act, by broadly defining `` good cause'' for waivers. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it probably would grant waivers if telephone companies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use those wires to sell video programs too. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said Wednesday's ruling did not presage any final <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> judgment on the cable-telephone company issue. `` This grant of this very limited waiver may produce very valuable information that will be useful to the commssion and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in evaluating that more generic question,'' he said. `` The precedent that results is narrow.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s purge of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s hierarchy had been long expected but became more pressing with the party's poor electoral showing and his growing impatience with the pace of reform. The Central Committee personnel changes he oversaw and his highly critical remarks at a committee meeting Tuesday about poor management by leaders appeared to set the stage for even more radical reform in his program of perestroika, or wholesale restructuring of the economy and society. Many senior party officials fared poorly in March 26 elections to the parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, when they faced opposition for the first time. And when the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> meets May 25, party members may encounter true dissent for the first time in such a setting, from the likes of human rights campaigner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>. Although the vast majority of the 2,250 deputies are party members, several, such as ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, are outspoken mavericks. In addition, at least three dozen party chiefs from around the country, including <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo who is party boss in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, and the premiers of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, were defeated. The president's carefully orchestrated removal of 110 officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting came exactly one month before the congress convenes to pick a smaller, more powerful legislature. It was not immediately clear whether any of the 110 ousted officials had run in the parliamentary elections, but their departure allows <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to put the party's house in order before the congress convenes and begins a new phase in political reform. Those purged included <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> and other holdovers from the <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era, now denounced as `` the period of stagnation.'' Last summer, at the party's first nationwide conference in 47 years, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> came under fire for conducting now-discredited <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> policies. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> was retired as president, and <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> lost his seat on the ruling Politburo last fall in another shake-up. The elections gave a clear signal to the party to move fast on perestroika. `` The Soviet people have pronounced themselves not just for perestroika, but also for its further deepening, for greater resolution in its implementation, for a most rapid change for the better in all spheres of our life,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a closing speech to the Central Committee. All party bodies, including the Politburo he heads, must realize that they `` did not keep pace with life,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, also the party's general secretary. After the meeting, party ideology chief <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told a news conference that the party was reviewing election results to determine whether losing candidates should retain their posts. Last week, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party officials decided not to remove <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON> as their leader despite his embarrassing loss at the polls, even without an opposing candidate. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promoted younger, more dynamic figures on the policy-making body, trimming it to a more manageable size with a higher proportion of tested supporters. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which fell from 301 to 251 full members, has not been so small since the days of <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who ruled from 1953-1964, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said. Among the new full members thought to be close to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said some officials had wanted to overhaul the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at last summer's party conference, but that action was postponed. Personal changes were required now, he said, because after the election, `` the situation has changed considerably.'' Normally, such changes would be made at a party congress, but the next session is n't scheduled until 1991, and it appeared <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could n't wait that long to prune dead wood. The senior officials offered <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a tactful, graceful way to remove them out without antagonizing their supporters. In a letter, they themselves offered to step aside. `` This way they go with honor. This would ensure they retain privileges of a pensioner,'' the diplomat said on condition of anomymity.

<HEAD>Excerpts From Gorbachev Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech Tuesday at the full meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, as translated and released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency: On recent elections to the new Soviet parliament: In this sense much food for thought has been offered by the past elections which became, as we now say, an effective referendum, one in favor of perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB-. The elections unequivocally said yes to perestroika. On food shortages: The food problem is far from solved. It keeps us concerned and we dealt with all related issues at the last <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum. The housing problem is acute. There is a dearth of consumer goods in the shops. The list of shortages is growing. The state's financial position is grave. People respond badly to shortages and to queues which take time and, to put it frankly, humiliate people. People regard this situation as a gap between words and deeds, as inconsistency between promises and real changes in life. On nationalities: Further sharp issues have arisen from, let us be blunt about it, the long-neglected need to perfect the Soviet multinational federation, and nationalist, extremist and anti-Soviet elements are attempting to exploit this fact in a number of localities. They are being joined in these attempts by people who are political failures or, more frequently, ordinary careerists. On general discontent: They -LRB- people -RRB- are displeased with the organization of the work of the trade and services sphere and city transport, with the long-neglected sanitary condition of the cities, with the absence of resolute struggle against economic mismanagement, violations of the rule of law, with the ecological state of the cities and settlements, with the attitude to cultural monuments. On reaction to political reforms: The fact is that some have already gone as far as saying that, in a manner of speaking, both democracy and openness are very nearly a disaster. And the fact that the people have begun to act, that they no longer wish to remain silent and insist on their claims, is perceived as taking restructuring too far. On causes of the economic crisis: What happened? Of course, there were things that could not be foreseen _ the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> accident, the decline of prices on the petroleum market and some other things. But, comrades, this can hardly account for all that has taken place in the economy, particularly on the consumer market. Military spending, uncompleted construction, managerial costs, and expenditures on the realization of some huge-scale projects and so on continued to grow. The major economic principle _ the priority of the rise in labor productivity over the increase in wages and salaries _ was seriously undermined. Negative trends in this field go on gathering strength so far rather than fade out. On economic mismanagement: The outcome of mismanagement which repeated itself from year to year was that a whole system of parasitic elements developed. ... The system which sows seeds of corruption, economic and criminal offenses, and anti-social morality around itself. The system which defends the conditions of its parasitising, and in many cases not without success. People see all these ugliest facts of mismanagement and justly demand a strict punishment of the culprits, not because of vengeance but to assert the realisation that it is inadmissible and impossible to throw the people's resources to the winds. I think, comrades, and this is opinion of the entire Politburo _ that we can no longer put up with mismanagement which literally compromises perestroika and does a tremendous damage _ economic and moral _ to the whole of society. On <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>: The Politburo gave instructions to painstakingly analyze everything that has happened there. It is clear already now, however, that we must do everything, using political methods and the force of the law in order to prevent a repetition of similar developments. The deepening and broadening of the party's natural ties with the masses, the working people, their cohesion and unity are the guarantee of the success of society's renewal that has begun, and of the success of restructuring. On Central Committee members who were retired: One generation of party members has naturally to replace another. This process should be perceived as such. Its correct perception also presupposes the fact that each generation makes its contribution to the history of the country and the people and that a new stage in the development of our state, our society and in achievement of new frontiers is connected with each generation.

 The birth of the second baby conceived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by non-surgical transfer of a fertilized egg into one of the mother's fallopian tubes was announced Wednesday by a doctor in suburban <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> IVF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, said the 4-pound, 15-ounce baby girl was born April 12 by caesarian section Although premature at 36 1 @ 2 weeks, the baby was pronounced healthy shortly after her birth, Dr. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said. Another baby girl conceived through the same procedure was born April 9 by normal delivery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>. Both babies were conceived by a process known as zygote intrafallopian transer, or <LOCATION> ZIFT </LOCATION>. A zygote is fertilized egg. This process and gamete intrafallopian transfer, or GIFT, are relatively new techniques that can be used when at least one of a woman's fallopian tubes appears normal, said a news release from the institute. A gamete is a mature sex cell, either sperm or egg. In vitro fertilization has been accomplished by non-surgical means for some time, but the <ORGANIZATION> ZIFT </ORGANIZATION> and GIFT procedures had until recently required placement of the zygotes or gametes into the fallopian tube by a surgical procedure, the release said. The baby's parents, who reside in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area, were not identified. The announcement said they were referred to Dr. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> in May 1986, after failing to conceive as a result of more standard treatments. The woman had three fertilized eggs placed non-surgically in her right fallopian tube in August 1988. She was confirmed to be pregnant about 11 days later.

<HEAD>United Official Says Airline Failed To Inspect Door</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cargo door that blew off a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in an accident that killed nine people went uninspected after major repairs, violating a federal requirement, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> executive testified Wednesday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>, a vice president for technical services, told <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators that the airline was unaware it had to inspect the locking mechanism after the Dec. 23 repairs in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't explain why it was missed,'' <PERSON> Doll </PERSON> said in the second day of the hearing as investigators continued to press the airline for details on the maintenance and operation of the forward cargo door. The door is a prime suspect in the accident, in which nine passengers were hurled to their deaths Feb. 24 over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 at 23,000 feet about 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, with 337 passengers and a crew of 18. Speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking mechanism of the cargo door which remains on the bottom of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. No decision has been made on whether to spend millions of dollars to retrieve the door. The hearing is to gather information for the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report, which will be released months from now in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> During the highly technical testimony, Doll also admitted that some <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> ground crews had used power tools to operate cargo doors even though The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has recommended against using such tools. He said sworn documents from ground crews indicated power tools were not used on the cargo door of the ill-fated plane in the months prior to the accident. Doll's comments were made the same day <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that it was ordering as much as $ 15.7 billion worth of new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners. Since 1987, when a cargo door partially opened on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 747 flying out of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has required that lock mechanisms of all 747s be visually inspected for signs of wear, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>. The company inspected all 31 of its 747s and found no problems, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. The rules also required that some older aluminum lock mechanisms be reinforced with steel, he said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> wanted to get a jump on the extensive reinforcing work on 21 of its older 747s, and went ahead with it based on a preliminary document, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. However, the work had not been completed on the plane involved in the accident, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials have said. United apparently did not see a later <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive requiring new inspections of all cargo doors that had to be operated manually because of problems with the electrical closing systems, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. The ill-fated plane had electrical closing system problems during flights over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in December, and the door was operated manually for more than a week before repairs were made in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> failed to again inspect the locking mechanism and the plane made 130 successful flights before the accident occurred, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. United officials discovered their error several weeks ago when they were going over paperwork to prepare for the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearing, he said. `` It's really unclear what implication this had to the whole thing,'' <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. Doll said the ill-fated plane did not have a history of unusual cargo door problems, and that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> recorded a total of 112 problems with forward and aft cargo doors in its 747s between March 1986 and February 1989. Eight of those were on the ill-fated plane, but other 747s reported more problems, he said. `` I would not call the cargo door a maintenance problem,'' Doll said. Doll also told investigators that the company had authorized use of some power tools with limited output because it found that it reduced damage to locking mechanisms during manual opening and closing of the cargo door. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has recommended against such use.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court waded into a dispute over what is a family Wednesday as it heard a homosexual man's appeal to keep the rent-controlled apartment he shared for a decade with his late lover. The case being argued before the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> revolves around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s tight and pricy housing market and the question of whether people in non-traditional living arrangements _ homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexuals _ have the same protection as married couples and relatives. When <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died in 1986, his name was on the lease to the apartment he and <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> shared on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> says he deserves to keep the apartment, with its government-controlled rent, because he and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> considered each other spouses. Their friends considered the apartment the home of `` any happily married couple,'' according to court papers. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>, 33, said the men exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a symbol of their commitment. He now wears both. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> was about 10 years older than <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, who had hired <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> to run his successful <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> beauty salon, left his lover $ 5 million. Since <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> has been fighting eviction. The landlord, <ORGANIZATION> Stahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maintains <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> was n't a member of <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s `` traditional family unit ... those related by blood, marriage or adoption.'' Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s rent-control law, leases can pass from parent to child or spouse to spouse. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> has argued that as a `` family member'' he should have automatic rights to the apartment even though his name was n't on the lease. `` What we're talking about is a family member,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer representing <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s top court. `` What we're asking for is no different from what any other family member would get.'' But lawyers for the landlord said no provisions were in the rent control law to protect `` surviving gay life partners'' from eviction. `` His -LRB- <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>'s -RRB- grievance is really with the law, which prohibited him and Mr. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> from marrying,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuzek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>'s lawyer, told the court. If <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> were evicted, <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> could raise the rent significantly for the apartment to `` fair market value.'' <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> pays about $ 700 a month for the one-bedroom apartment near the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> on </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 54th </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, according to his lawyers. Actual market value in that section of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> could be hundreds of dollars higher. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON>'s departure also would make it easier for the landlord to convert the building into more lucrative cooperatives. `` We're talking about the right to charge fair market rent for an apartment that is currently occupied by a person who has just inherited $ 5 million,'' <PERSON> Yuzek </PERSON> said after Wednesday's court hearing. If <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> is allowed to stay, his rent increases would be restricted to 6 percent annually on a one-year lease or 9 percent on a two-year lease by the city's rent-control law. <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>'s lawyers have accused <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> of trying to turn the case into a referendum on homosexual rights. But <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said the landlord wanted to create that impression `` to prejudice the atmosphere'' and that the case is simply about family rights. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s lower courts have disagreed on the case. A trial-level judge halted the eviction, citing the `` time, love and commitment given by <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> to <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>.'' But the judge was overturned on appeal. <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> has been allowed to stay in the apartment while the case makes its way through the courts. Gay rights activists have called the case the most important in the nation dealing with non-traditional living arrangements. `` The case is about individuals who live in families that vary from the <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> mold,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a national gay rights organization. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>' decision _ not expected until June _ could be applied to numerous other social areas where the term `` family'' is crucial, such things as group health insurance, hospital visitation and inheritances. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Court of Appeals ruled in 1984 that one member of a homosexual couple could n't adopt the other to keep from being evicted from an apartment that only allowed family members to live together.

 An Exxon tanker carrying more than 22 million gallons of Alaskan crude oil lost power and drifted off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast for nearly seven hours Wednesday before it was taken in tow. The 810-foot Exxon <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> had drifted to the northwest, away from land, in an area without reefs and in water 600 feet deep with calm seas and mild winds, Coast Guard <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Billeaudeaux </PERSON> said. A tugboat began towing the vessel to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for repairs shortly after 3 p.m., <PERSON> Billeaudeaux </PERSON> said. The trip should take about 20 hours. The single-hulled tanker was about nine miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flattery </LOCATION> and 12 miles west of the entrance to the Strait of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON> when a boiler tube failed about 8:30 a.m., shutting down the propulsion system, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The crew of 20 never was in danger, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. The incident occurred less than a month after the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground March 24 near <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, dumping 11.2 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, built in 1970, underwent a shipyard inspection one month ago, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. The tanker left the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline terminus at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> early Sunday for a non-Exxon refinery in <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION>, about 65 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratterman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. It carried 532,862 barrels of oil, or 22.38 gallons, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. One or two tankers a day make the journey from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> traded charges of hypocrisy, lies and bad faith Wednesday in one of their most acrimonious public exchanges about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the council, and Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON>, council president this month, clashed over the issue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani support to Afghan rebels and Soviet support to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. Each side accused the other of violating the U.N.-mediated <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords agreeing to non-interference in the affairs of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were co-guarantors. `` It is the height, or depth of hypocrisy for the representative of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to claim that the regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> are fulfilling their obligations under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have failed to do so,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> told the council. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> responded: `` As for the nonparliamentary response by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about lies and hypocrisy, it seems to me that the world community ... has formed a very clear idea about who is hypocritical and who has been lying in this hall.'' The council held its seventh meeting in more than two weeks to hear <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s complaint that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating the agreements by arming and training Afghan rebels, sending their arms to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and deploying its own army, intelligence services, logistics units and militia to fight the Afghan army. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denied the charges, but Ambassador <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON>, in a scathing speech, would not say from where the arms came or how they were transported to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is known to supply the rebels with Stinger and Blowpipe missiles and other arms. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> supplies the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government with Scud missiles and other sophisticated weapons. The meeting was adjourned without a date being set for another meeting. No vote or statement was expected. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which openly aides the Moslem, anti-government rebels, says it is not directly involved in the conflict. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have cited numerous alleged instances of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> sending armed men and weapons into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Afghan rebels were not party to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords and have rejected it. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to a joint cut-off in aid to their respective sides, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has refused. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help the Marxist government battle the Moslem rebels. More than 100,000 Soviet soldiers were in the country before the withdrawal began in May 1988. The last soldiers left in February. Earlier, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, responding to an <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> threat, warned the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> it would retaliate against any Afghan aggression and accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> of turning <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> into a new `` killing fields.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, the acting permanent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative, told the council: `` The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime is desperately clinging to power by force of arms _ through extensive and ongoing imports of foreign -LRB- <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> -RRB- arms _ against the will of the vast majority of its people.'' He said the current debate has not furthered either the cause of peace or the self-determination of the Afghan people. `` It is ridiculous to expect the Afghan people to accept as their freely chosen leader a former secret police chief -LRB- <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> -RRB- who was installed by a foreign power,'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime, even with outside help, will inevitably fail ... <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is not and never has been the aggressor.''

 Actor <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a sidekick of <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> from radio days who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny. `` Oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face,'' the 83-year-old <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` She never saw it, but she was extremely amusing.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who is appearing in a play in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, spent the day in an <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> hotel room, mourning the death of <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend. `` The world will miss her greatly,'' the actor said. `` I personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the world ... a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius _ the only one I've ever really known.'' In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> was the flustered banker Mr. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> in `` The Lucy Show'' from 1962-68. The next six years saw him as <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> on `` Here's <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.'' They were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived `` Life With <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program `` My Favorite Husband,'' which later became `` I Love Lucy'' on television. `` I thought she was a very good-looking young woman, and very talented,'' he recalled. `` She was very pleasant to work with. None of us knew what was going to happen _ television was very young then and it was n't taken too seriously. We never dreamed it would ever become the power it was ... and the great stars it would produce.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> last spoke to Miss Ball from <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> on his birthday, Feb. 20, when `` she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> has done regular stints for years at a chain of Edmonton-based dinner theaters called Stage West. He is currently appearing with that company's <ORGANIZATION> Mayfair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dinner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> as a priest in the play `` Mass Appeal.'' The play has another month to run and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> says that means he wo n't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral. `` I could n't do that because it would put people out of work,'' he said. `` She would be the first one to scream her head off if I did that.''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Thursday challenged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to move from `` rhetoric to reality'' by taking concrete steps to lessen military tensions in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in his first major address since arriving here less than 24 hours ago, said communism has failed and the world's democracies must `` capitalize on this triumph.'' `` We should, because we are strong and prudent, continue to ask hard questions such as when are the Soviets going to move their troops out of the northern territories of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` When are the Soviets going to stop providing more modern arms to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and when will the Soviets actually decrease rather than increase their military aid to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to promote peace in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s first trip to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> comes against a backdrop of the upcoming Sino-Soviet summit. Next month Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the first summit between the two countries in 20 years. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` We must challenge the Soviets to move from rhetoric to reality, from pledges about tension reduction to real tension-reducing measures.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with Australian Defense Minister <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s foreign affairs minister, <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Earlier, the vice president held a 90-minute session with Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> at which the two discussed economic and defense issues and the common strains with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. In his speech, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said any minor economic frictions should not be allowed to harm the strong alliance that has developed between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The two discussed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s threat to withdraw from the <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as well as economic issues, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Australian officials who briefed reporters but refused to be quoted by name. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit, timed to coincide with Australian-American Friendship Week, comes at a time when the relationship between the allies is in `` excellent shape,'' the Australian official said. He categorized the discussions as `` very friendly indeed,'' and said the two might try to hold additional talks before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> leaves the city on Thursday. Of concern to the leaders, however, was the threat by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> to withdraw from the Australian-New Zealand-U.S. defense alliance, known as <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> made his comments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this week. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> has been excluded from the <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> announced in 1984 that his government would not allow nuclear ships to visit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> ports. However, that country has not formally withdrawn from the ministerial council. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> raised the issue of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in an attempt to gauge the seriousness of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s threat, but <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> was unable to tell him whether <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s speech amounted to a fundamental shift in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> policy, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Australian officials said. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> also talked about initiatives for greater Pacific regional cooperation on economic matters, ones that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported, the officials said. The vice president also told <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to subsidize grain exports was not designed to hurt <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The Australians have complained that such subsidies hurt their wheat exports.

<HEAD>Authorities Round up Eskimos at Anti-NATO Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOOSE BAY, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Military and federal police dragged about 50 Eskimos from a runway at an air base Wednesday to break up a protest against low-level <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> flights, a military spokesman said. For the past seven months, the Eskimos have mounted a series of such protests at the Goose Bay air base, which they say is built on their ancestral hunting grounds. The Innu Eskimos got onto the base Wednesday by cutting through a gate, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jodoin </PERSON>, a Canadian Forces spokesman. He said the men, women, and children then fanned out across a runway, yelling, `` We do n't want <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>!'' They were herded into military buses and police cars. The chief of the local Innu, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashini </PERSON>, was among those rounded up, a spokesman for the protesters said on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> could not say afterward how many demostrators were kept in custody. Those arrested will be charged under military regulations with trespassing, <PERSON> Jodoin </PERSON> said. The demonstration followed last week's acquittal by a provincial court of four Eskimos who were charged with public mischief for protesting last fall at the base on this Canadian island province in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. In his landmark ruling, Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Igloliorte </PERSON> cleared the four on the basis that they honestly believe the ground where the base is located belongs to the Eskimos. The Eskimos say the low-level flights are turning their ancestral hunting grounds into a war zone. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> flights are made by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The military says the Eskimos are using the protests to pressure the government in longstanding territorial disputes.

 Three senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee asked Wednesday for an congressional intelligence committee probe into why the panel did not receive crucial <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration documents that have come out at the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. An initial review by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff members found that four documents introduced as evidence in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial never were turned over to congressional investigators in 1987 when they looked into the administration's <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms deal and Contra support initiatives. Two other documents in the committee's files are similar to ones released at the trial, but are missing important attachments or notations. One document, an April 25, 1985, memo from then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, recommends that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephone Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> to reassure him of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for the Contras. Missing from the congressional copy is the notation, `` cc Vice President,'' apparently signaling that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sent a copy of the memo. `` These six documents are sufficient to raise questions about the procedures followed by the executive branch in providing documents to the <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the completeness of its compliance with agreements on the provision of documents,'' said a letter asking for the investigation. The request was sent to Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, chairman and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and was signed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Sens <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, the chairman and vice chairman of the Iran-Contra panel. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One on Wednesday, `` We will cooperate in any way we can, but otherwise we do n't know much about it. `` This does n't involve us directly,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` This is between the senators and the intelligence committee. They're looking into the last administration's procedures and it does n't relate to It's an internal matter for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to look into.'' White House Counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, said his office had contacted <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s counsel during much of the time at issue, and that <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> has offered to review the matter and informally brief the senators. `` We have confidence that the last administration followed the agreed procedures -LRB- for releasing the material -RRB- and that its representatives will be able to address your concerns,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s letter said `` We, of course endeavor to be as helpful as we can ...'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, in a statement, promised to `` look at this matter expeditiously and in a businesslike, non-political manner.'' The letter said some of the documents contain key evidence about the way <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials conducted policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1985 `` and raise questions regarding ... possible efforts to circumvent the provisions of the law'' which barred direct or indirect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. A similar request was made two weeks ago by Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee An aide to <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said Wednesday that he had not yet received a response to his request of White House Counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. The congressional committees, after an extensive investigation, concluded that a `` cabal of ... zealots'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration seized control of policy in the affair which sent weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and profits from the sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. But documents and testimony during the North trial suggest that senior officials up to and including <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-vice president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were more involved in the affair than the committees knew. Among documents which the congressional panels did not receive were a Feb. 19, 1985, memo outlining a plan to step up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in return for that nation's support of the Contras, and a memo dated the following day making it clear that the administration knew it was forbidden from providing aid under those circumstances. Also not turned over to congressional investigators was an Oct. 30, 1985, memo from North to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> about reconnaissance of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and mentioning the air drop of two recoilless rifles to the rebels. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Belnick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney who was on the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, said the documents clearly should have been sent in response to congressional requests and would have been helpful in the investigation. But he added, `` If this is the sum and substance, ... they would n't have materially changed any of the conclusions'' reached by investigators.

 She was nervous, like thousands of young women who have gone before her. Still, the 23-year-old woman made final arrangements Wednesday for her abortion at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> clinic that challenged <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s restrictions on the procedure She said she was afraid the showdown in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` might change things.'' `` I wanted the services to be available to me legally,'' said the woman, who asked that her name not be used. `` My finances wo n't let me have another child I think I should have the right to choose.'' While the tension at the <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> clinic was subdued, thousands of protesters from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> staged demonstrations on both sides of the issue. `` This is a monumental day of reckoning for women's lives in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where about 800 pro-choice demonstrators marched at the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Capitol. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> clinic initiated the case of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services by challenging restrictions in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s abortion law. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could use its ruling in the case to tighten or even overturn its landmark 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision legalizing abortion. `` There were more concerns in the waiting room this morning,'' said <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, the clinic's director of community education. `` There is an awareness, an edge today that I have n't seen previously. The increasingly bitter debate has made it even more difficult for women coming to the clinic to make a decision, said <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Sova </PERSON>, director of counseling at the clinic. `` Abortion has always been a very serious, difficult choice for women,'' <PERSON> Sova </PERSON> said. `` Anytime something like this is fought over in public, it adds to the difficulty.'' In <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 2,000 pro-choice demonstrators rallied at the state capitol as a half-dozen abortion opponents rallied nearby. Placard-carrying abortion foes approached the rally, but were surrounded by poster-toting pro-choice demonstrators. State police separated the two groups, then stayed between them throughout the protest. `` This is not a women's issue,'' actor <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Busfield </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething,'' told the pro-choice rally. `` It's a family issue. It's a human rights issue.'' <PERSON> Nola </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who said she had two abortions before becoming an abortion foe, told reporters that `` abortion is a major death experience. Women can not participate in the death of their own child and not be psychologically impaired.'' In <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, state Rep. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> introduced a bill declaring abortion centers public nuisances in the event the high court overturns <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a Democrat, has drafted most of the state anti-abortion laws that parallel <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s. In <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, more than 800 pro-choice demonstrators shouted slogans and carried white coat hangers dipped in red paint to symbolize back-alley abortions. About 300 people attended a pro-choice rally at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> in the culmination of an on-campus vigil that has been going on for days. Rallies were also held in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. Operation Rescue, which has mounted a series of major anti-abortion protests aimed at blocking access to clinics, is planning protests in 65 cities Friday and Saturday, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Magera </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. She said the group would work for a `` human life amendment'' to the Constitution, and would seek bans on abortion in individual states in the event the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturns <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>

 Stomachaches and stress are plaguing many <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> natives who live off the sea and have lost their traditional diet of fish and seal meat because of the Exxon oil spill. Native people, warned about contamination in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, have had to turn to beef, chicken and canned luncheon meat for protein. `` It takes the body a while to adapt to eating that stuff,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kompkoff </PERSON>, president of the village council in <LOCATION> Tatitlek </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. `` There are a lot of problems with it, a lot of diarrhea and stomachaches.'' <LOCATION> Tatitlek </LOCATION> is 28 miles from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> and eight miles from where the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground March 24. Meantime, a break in the weather sent crews back to cleaning up the oil on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coastline and the governor urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to buy back oil leases in a rich fishing bay. A federal judge also consolidated 27 civil cases already filed against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the tanker that ran aground and caused the nation's worst oil spill. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, noting the oil spill's effects in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, said that such an enviromental disaster in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, which oil companies have paid the federal government $ 114.7 million for the right to explore, `` is unthinkable.'' `` It is time to cancel the sale and refund the bid money,'' he said. Skimmers were deployed across the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coastline and around the southern tip of <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> to Homer. The giant Soviet skimmer was deployed near <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>. Exxon, which is responsible for the estimated 11.2 million gallon oil spill, has begun sending food shipments to <LOCATION> Tatitlek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chenega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and English Bay. The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Division of Subsistence is working on ways to help people in those villages resume their traditional diets as oil from the nation's worst spill continues to pollute sections of the south central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast. Slackening weather enabled some crews to resume cleanup in the sound, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> transport USS Juneau left <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> with 200 workers who will scrub oil off hard-hit beaches on <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> islands. However, the disposal of 14,000 pounds of waste accumulated in the cleanup still has n't been resolved, and the state is concerned the dispute points to more problems with an oil consortium's plans to clean future oil spills. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Envirnomental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> wants the waste burned at the consortium's incinerator in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says its incinerator has been working around the clock and its facilities ca n't hold any more broken booms and oily absorbent pads. `` It seems like <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> does n't want to be readily involved in this,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Mach </PERSON> of the environmental agency. `` This continues to be a matter of commitments that were made with regards to how the trans-Alaska pipleine system was to be operated ...,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> said. The spill has disrupted normal operations all over the sound. One possible exception is the salmon hatcheries, which are releasing millions of fry this week as plankton _ a food source for the young fish _ reaches its peak bloom. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, vice president of the fishermen's union <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, said salmon will be caught and tested for oil contamination before the scheduled May 15 opening of the Copper River salmon harvest. For the natives in <LOCATION> Tatitlek </LOCATION>, the spill has affected more than their diet. It has cast their way of life into turmoil as seasonal routines associated with gathering and preserving food are thrown off, council president <PERSON> Kompkoff </PERSON> said. `` We've been set in our ways for so many years. There's a lot of stress, a lot of worry about what the future holds for us,'' he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, research director for the state Division of Subsistence, said this is a critical time for harvests. `` This is the time of year when major food resources arrive and are put up for the year,'' he said. Harvests of herring and herring roe already have been missed because of the spill. And collection of shellfish such as clams also has been disrupted, he said. There are concerns the salmon harvest that begins in mid-May and provides about one-third of the subsistence food supply will be affected, as well. `` No residents here have been able to harvest anything,'' <PERSON> Kompkoff </PERSON> said. Many of their boats have been hired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to help with the cleanup. An <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> contractor has sent two shipments of food to <LOCATION> Tatitlek </LOCATION> and one each to <LOCATION> Chenega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, English Bay and <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> since distributions began May 14, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidinger </PERSON>, rural affairs specialist for the oil company. Fish has been requested and likely will be provided in future shipments, she said. Some people are uncomfortable with the idea of food being sent in, <PERSON> Kompkoff </PERSON> said. `` We get this oil spill and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> thinks it can replace our subsistence resources by sending food,'' he said. `` They ca n't.'' <PERSON> Meidinger </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s program is intended to help people through difficult times while work to deal with effects of the oil spill is under way. `` I think that's appropriate,'' she said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Asks For Resignation of Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Right-wing military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> asked for the resignation of all 15 of his Cabinet members Wednesday to allow changes in some posts, a government spokesman said. The measure coincided with local media reports that Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> had disagreements with his interior minister, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, over proposed democratic reforms. No official explanation was given for the shake-up, however. The government declined to say what portfolios would be changed. It is customary in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> for all Cabinet ministers to hand in letters of resignation even when only one or two changes are planned. The government spokesman, army Gen. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, told journalists at the government palace that the resignations were requested at a 70-minute meeting of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and his full Cabinet late in the day. `` He expressed his intention of making changes in the current Cabinet,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> `` is evaluating the current political situation'' and asked all government ministers to hand in their resignations so the president would have `` freedom of action.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> did not say when the changes would be announced. `` There is no date yet for swearing in the new Cabinet,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. According to some local news reports, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> have differed over proposed amendments to the country's 1980 constitution and other legal reforms. According to the reports, <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> wants to allow several democratic reforms sought by opposition political groups before scheduled Dec. 14 national elections to pick a successor to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has said he will remain army commander after the elections. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who seized power in a violent 1973 coup, was forced to call the elections when he lost a yes-or-no referendum last October on a proposal to extend his rule to 1997.

 The government of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> has decided to move the proposed site of an airport to protect a rare blue coral reef, officials announced Wednesday. The government of the Japanese prefecture, changing a 7-year-old plan, decided to build the new airport 2.5 miles north of the original site on the east coast of <LOCATION> Ishigaki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakurai </PERSON> said.

 Players drove, flew, took the train and walked to the nearest <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lottery ticket counter up to the last minute Wednesday before the winning North American record jackpot of more than $ 100 million was drawn. The official winning numbers were 06; 16; 24; 34; 35; 37; 40; 41; 45; 60; 71. A winning ticket must have seven of the 11 numbers drawn. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON>, the lottery's executive director, said the prize would be `` something higher than $ 100 million when it's all said and done.'' How much higher wo n't be known until sometime Thursday, but unofficial estimates have put the jackpot at more than $ 110 million. Thursday also is the earliest it will will be known whether there is a jackpot winner, said lottery spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. And it wo n't be until Friday when the number of winners, if any, is known, officials have said. `` We are now running the computer to go through all 87 million transactions in an attempt to identify if there are any winners,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, referring to the $ 87.3 million worth of tickets sold since last Thursday. The huge jackpot set off a lottery mania. Players took planes and trains from around the country to join in the buying frenzy. `` Being frivolous, it was worth it. Being conservative, I could've found better things to do with my money,'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasca </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` No one at work concentrated on work for the past two days.'' At the Penn-Ohio Drug Store in <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, night supervisor <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinckes </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said there were 75 to 100 people in line trying to buy tickets when the machine closed for the drawing. `` We kept going out and telling them they were n't going to make it,'' she said. `` Some left, but some stayed. Most were from out-of-town.'' In an average week, the state usually sells about 4 million or 5 million tickets, but on Tuesday alone about 24 million tickets were sold, said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, deputy revenue secretary. From 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. Wednesday, about 7 million tickets were sold. Players came from all over the country. But lottery officials considered the nightmarish possibility that no one would win Wednesday night's Super 7 drawing. The odds of any one ticket bearing seven winning numbers is one in 9.6 million. With more than 74 million tickets sold in the last week, and the jackpot rolled over because of no winner in six previous drawings, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said the odds are about 4,000-to-1 against another rollover. Although a winner or winners could come forward, lottery officials said that because of the high volume of sales they would n't know for certain until sometime Friday if a winning ticket had been sold or how many had been sold. They said the computer would give them a preliminary indication Thursday afternoon, but that it would take another day to complete backup reviews of ticket numbers. If there is a rollover, next week's jackpot could approach $ 200 million, payable over 26 years, and some lottery agents would run out of tickets. `` We could n't handle another week like this, selling all these tickets, without having spot shortages,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. As a precaution, he said, the lottery was lining up vendors to do emergency printing runs if necessary. `` We're in a brave new world, uncharted waters,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. If a rollover occurred and the jackpot soared beyond $ 150 million, he added, `` I think the atmosphere would be even weirder.'' At least one vendor also hoped against another rollover. `` I've already told my customers not to come in if there is n't a winner tonight,'' said <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Donavich </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>'s Cards and News in <LOCATION> Burgettstown </LOCATION>, near the Pennsylvania-West Virginia-Ohio border. `` I'm locking the doors and I'm leaving town until after next Thursday,'' she joked. Vendors receive 5 cents for each $ 1 ticket they sell. She said a constable and police officer were posted in the store, in part to alleviate her fear of being robbed, because of extra money from ticket sales. `` I've been terrified to stay in my own home for fear of somebody breaking in and demanding money, even though I do n't keep it there.'' But if state officials and vendors were wearing out, players were n't. Lines of a dozen people or more were reported at most establishments and ticket sales were still brisk. The volume prompted the state to press into service about 100 spare machines that are usually kept in reserve. At <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, in a shopping mall near the Capitol, only about six people waited in line, including <PERSON> Paulita </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidot </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> housewife who planned to buy one ticket. She laughed guiltily when her husband spied her in line, explaining, `` This is my first time. Usually I give him a hard time for playing ... I just wanted to say I participated.'' Also in line was <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohensky </PERSON>, a federal clerk who said she did n't believe in lotteries but was buying five tickets. `` I do n't feel one person should get $ 100 million,'' she said. `` These are for my grandfather. He's hooked. I'd like to see him win. He's very, very sick. -LRB- The jackpot -RRB- could go towards his medical expenses.'' Even <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Despot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON>, winners of the previous <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> record jackpot of $ 46 million, bought a piece of the action. <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION>, said he bought $ 100 worth of tickets, but mostly for fun and not really in hope of winning. `` Nobody would want to play anymore if we won again,'' he said with a laugh.

 An American professor drowned when floodwaters swept his four-wheel drive vehicle from a bridge over a raging river, police said Thursday. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 41, a former resident of <LOCATION> Pawling </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was trapped on the roof of his vehicle before being swept away Wednesday by the rising waters of the swollen <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nerang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The vehicle apparently had stalled on the bridge, police said Thursday.

He surfaced again, then disappeared.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s vehicle later was discovered two miles downstream, near where the body was discovered. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was previously the coordinator of doctoral programs in accounting at the <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Professor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet diplomat arrived here Wednesday to discuss a troubled peace plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in what was the first official visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> approved by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 33 years. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1956 over its racial policies. Since then, the two countries have had direct dealings only in a few international agencies and in cartels dealing with diamonds and gold. Security men taped a small cardboard Soviet flag to the windshield of a limousine that carried Soviet official <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> away from D.F. Malan Airport after he was greeted by <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, director-general of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Foreign Affairs Department. He arrived on the same plane carrying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the talks, which also involve <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The discussions are part of regularly scheduled meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitoring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, set up to monitor an agreement that provided for withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for the South African-controlled territory of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The plan was disrupted on April 1 when hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas crossed the border from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, instead of waiting to return in mid-May, unarmed, as outlined in the agreement. More than 300 men have been killed in the fighting, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> officials have said that U.N. Resolution 435, the independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, might be in jeopardy if the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas do not leave the territory. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said its forces will be confined to their bases in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from Wednesday evening through Saturday morning to give the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas a chance to return to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> unhindered. <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>, making his first trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, ruled out the possibility of any talks with the South Africans except on the subject of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` If you mean bilateral talks in the sense of having some political or other relations, I have no intention of this at the present time,'' he told a news conference. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation was led by <PERSON> Chas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs.

<TEXT>
 A man who officials say used bogus resumes and references to land government jobs across the country was ordered Wednesday to serve 90 days in jail and pay $ 18,000 in restitution to an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> village. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 34, was sentenced on a first-degree theft charge stemming from his brief tenure as <LOCATION> Kake </LOCATION> city administrator last year. He pleaded no contest to the felony charge, which alleged he took $ 28,000 in salary, benefits and expenses before he was fired in December. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> placed <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> on probation for seven years, ordered him not to accept any government job during that time and gave him credit for 60 days of jail time already served. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>'s request to be freed without additional jail time, and ordered him to write lettrs of apology to the towns of <PERSON> Kake </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, as well as serve the final 30 days of the sentence. `` This is pretty reprehensible conduct,'' the judge said of <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>'s employment record. District Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ells </PERSON> said he will dismiss a theft-by-deception charge filed against <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> by officials in <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> was employed briefly as city manager in August. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> sent the city $ 707 in restitution Tuesday, and the <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> prosecutor asked to drop the charge, <PERSON> Ells </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> restitution represented expense money <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> was paid before he resigned amid allegations he faked his resume. `` What I did here was wrong,'' said <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>, who is married and has four daughters. `` I lied on my resume because I needed a job to feed my family, and instead of doing it the right way ... I took too many shortcuts.'' <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> said he would move once he finished serving his time in jail, but was unsure where. His lawyer, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Treiber </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> was considering a move to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> could move out of <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, where he has been unable to find a job since posting bail. But the judge expressed concern that <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> would try to get a government job again, and ordered him to check monthly with his probation officer in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` I'm not sure that Mr. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> is going to be able to make the kind of money honestly that he made lying,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> did not order <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> to pay the $ 28,000 in restitution the state requested, saying <PERSON> Kake </PERSON> did get some value from his work. Residents of <LOCATION> Kake </LOCATION>, a small fishing and timber town on the northern tip of <LOCATION> Kupreanof </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, became suspicious of <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> shortly after he arrived to take the $ 44,000-a-year administrator's job. He bought a luxurious $ 66,000 double mobile home, rifles and 1,000 rounds of ammunition with city money, and refused to release his resume for public inspection. A check of police records revealed the outstanding <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> warrant in December, and he was arrested. Interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states revealed that at least 19 of <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>'s jobs since 1980 were with city or county governments. Records and the interviews showed <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> used false information to obtain at least 11 of the jobs. Law enforcement officials said <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> apparently earned a living by cashing as many salary and expense checks as he could before his bosses became suspicious and he either quit or was fired. Wednesday's sentence was the second time <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> has been convicted of a charge stemming from his false resumes. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was placed on a year's probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, The charge alleged he used false information to get hired as <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> police chief. He was fired after four months when the discrepancies in his resume were reported in the news media. Other states in which <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> allegedly applied or obtained jobs under false pretenses include <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

Outside the Waldorf, the Women and AIDS Network held a small demonstration and passed out leaflets blasting Cosmopolitan magazine, which had been nominated for general excellence with Sports Illustrated, Reader's Digest and Parents in the category for magazines with over 1 million circulation.

<HEAD>Two Teens Indicted In Central Park Wolfpack Attack on Jogger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A grand jury Wednesday indicted two teen-age boys in last week's Central Park `` wolf pack'' beating and gang rape of a jogger that left the 28-year-old Wall Street investment banker in a coma. <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, 14, are among the eight youths charged in the attack. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> that the grand jury had returned an indictment against <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON>, but refused to give the charges or other details. Ms. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> did n't mention <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, but sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the grand jury had indicted him as well. Both <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, who was not in court, have been charged with first-degree rape, second-degree attempted murder and first-degree assault. The victim was attacked by a `` wolf pack'' of up to a dozen youths as she jogged through the park that night. She was raped, beaten unconscious and left for dead in underbrush, where she was found several hours later. In a written confession, <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON> admitted fondling the victim and hitting her with a pipe but denied raping her. The other seven suspects made videotaped confessions, police say. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>'s announcement complied with a law requiring that a defendant charged with a felony be indicted within five days of his arrest or be released on their own recognizance. <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> scheduled May 10 for a bail hearing before another judge. Ms. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> told the judge additional charges would be filed against the defendants. Robbery, rioting and assault charges have been filed against four of the eight defendants in attacks on other people the night of April 19. Indictments against the other six youths involved in the attack were expected Thursday. <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON>'s mother, aunt and several cousins and friends of the family were in the courtroom Wednesday. Family friend <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a third-grade teacher at P.S. 225 in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> who tutored <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION> in math, said he would be very surprised if the boy took part in the attack. He said <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON> was an easy-going, artistic boy who had some learning problems. The victim remained in stable but critical condition one week after the April 19 attack, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, head of the surgical intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` She still is in a comatose state,'' he said.

 The miniseries comes to `` Mister <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' Neighborhood'' next week, and the show's cardigan-clad creator promises a message as gentle and reassuring as ever The three-part musical, titled `` <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> the Short-Neck Giraffe,'' tells the story of a young giraffe who yearns for a long, graceful neck like all the other giraffes. She eventually grows, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> confided, `` not on the outside, but on the important side.'' `` It's very much like the usual message of the Neighborhood, that you can be acceptable as you are,'' he said, smiling. `` It's not so much the outsides of us that are important. A song sung by <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> and her friend <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> the elephant sums it up best, according to <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>. `` You're much more than a neck, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>. And you're much more than a trunk, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>. A chicken's more than a peck, and there's more than a smell to a skunk,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> quietly sang during an interview at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s WQED-TV, home to his children's programs for the past 35 years. The special week of new programs gets under way Monday on <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> stations with a trip to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Animal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where viewers are introduced to real-life giraffes and elephants. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> visits a film processing lab to have his animal photographs developed. The miniseries, which features a cast of 15, elaborate animal costumes and five sets, runs Wednesday through Friday. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> gently guides his young audience from one day to the next, summarizing the main events and hinting at what might lie ahead for <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>. In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, where animals sing, dance and play the trombone, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> is befriended by <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>, a shy giraffe who overcomes his problems by helping <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> conquer hers. He accomplishes that with help from <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> the elephant, who advises him to `` just let your heart speak.'' `` There is n't a time that I see the scene in which <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> talks and sings with <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> ... that I have n't gotten chills up my spine,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said, tapping his right hand against his back. `` And this is something I've worked with for years. There's something so redemptive about someone who is trying so hard to help somebody else. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, 61, wrote `` <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> the Short-Neck Giraffe'' for a French class assignment at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rollins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1950. He named <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> the giraffe after fraternity brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>, who went on to sing with the Metropolitan Opera and was a frequent guest on `` Mister Rogers Neighborhood.'' <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> died a year ago, and the miniseries is dedicated to him. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> set the story to music in the late 1950s, and about 1,000 records were pressed. Writer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> transformed `` <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> the Short-Neck Giraffe'' into a poem for children in 1975. For years, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> tried to have the musical produced on stage or as an animated film. `` I still think it would be great for animation and a stage production,'' he said. `` But I thought unless we get it out on the air, I do n't think anybody's going to know about it.'' The story <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> wrote 39 years ago is vastly different from the musical airing next week. It is the Neighborhood's 13th musical. `` At the end of the -LRB- original -RRB- story, when people are telling <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> that they like her just the way she is, she raises her head to look at them because she has n't really heard this message before and her neck starts to grow. And it grows and grows and grows until her neck is as tall as everybody else's,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. In the musical, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>'s neck remains short. `` I think it shows how much we've grown,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` You know, you do n't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable and to feel acceptable. And wishes do n't always come true. `` Because for a year and a day I've been wishing, she sang. That was one of her first songs. Her wish was for a longer neck, she thought. But really her wish was to have people like her exactly as she is. So often what we say we're wishing for is n't necessarily what is behind the wish. This is very philosophical.'' Will pre-schoolers be able to grasp such a serious message, even in such a light-hearted setting? `` Maybe not in words, but let their hearts speak to them the way <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> said to <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>, ` Just let your heart speak,''' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` I think that that's the way an awful lot of communication takes place.''

<HEAD>Churches' Shareholder Clout Seen Having Impact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> rarely admits that its business decisions are swayed by demands of religious idealists. But the churches keep trying and see evidence of results. The effects often are n't immediate, and defeats are numerous, but ministers, priests and nuns stick to prodding the stockholder meetings, and eventually, company changes come, by degrees. `` It's a cumulative impact,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Corporate Responsibillity. `` The churches also have become more sophisticated about it and are working with a broader network. They're having a more powerful influence on companies.'' The religious persistence has loosed a stream of 166 church-sponsored shareholder resolutions into scheduled meetings this year of 124 corporations, pressing for various actions. Some of the requests are expected to be settled in advance through negotiation without coming up for a vote, indicating the consideration given church proposals. `` From a fourth to a third of the resolutions are withdrawn in negotiations through a meeting of minds,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` It has become standard wisdom for companies to be open to these talks.'' Altogether, the 22 Protestant denominations and agencies and 220 Roman Catholic orders and dioceses working to influence corporate polices hold stock worth a total of $ 25 billion. `` The religious community is challenging corporations to raise their standards and make accountability to society and community a part of their success formula,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. When the movement first began 18 years ago, churches could seldom garner the 3 percent of the votes needed to keep an issue on the ballot for the next meeting, but now they regularly win 10 percent to 25 percent. `` That's of pretty strong significance, and ca n't just be ignored,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The church clout has been strengthened by combining on many issues with various other institutional shareholders, public and private, bringing the total shareholder leverage to more than $ 260 billion. Reflecting results of the efforts, a total of 117 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in the last five years have sold their holdings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, repeatedly targeted by church resolutions because of its system of racial separation. That still was a prime concern this year, with 100 companies asked to end business ties with that country, such as extended bank loans and trade or franchise arrangements, even though many of the companies have quit direct operations there. `` The business climate is changing in regard to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and companies are seeing its best to disengage,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratcher </PERSON>, communications director of the interfaith coalition. `` We're no longer just little shareholder resolutions, but selective buying and other profit forces are at work.'' The center, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, is coordinating resolutions on numerous other matters, including asking 17 companies to halt nuclear weapons production and begin converting to peaceful alternatives. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security is served more effectively through jobs and trade competitiveness and that is where expertise should be applied,'' said Sister <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinonen </PERSON>, the center's program director on arms issues. Protestant and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> shareholders also are asking 11 companies for affirmative action on behalf of women and racial minority employes. <PERSON> Dara </PERSON> <PERSON> Demmings </PERSON>, director of the center's equality program, said companies have become `` more open to suggestions from religious affiliated investors'' about their affirmative-action programs. Religious investors also are questioning 21 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies about equal employment practices in plants in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, asking for stepped up efforts against religious discrimination, blamed in the strife there. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION>, said that while many companies are reluctant to admit it, `` they're paying a great deal more attention to resolutions coming from the churches than before.'' He said one corporate official described the churches concerns as an `` early social warning system'' pointing to problematical situations needing to be treated before they become severe.

 In back-to-back appraisals, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued their own report cards on their first 100 days. Not surprisingly, the marks were excellent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his administration is off to a good start in confronting problems that demand `` urgent attention and decisive action,'' and in setting a steady course for long-term progress. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is disproving `` the so-called declininsts,'' who see signs of national retreat. The vice president said his message on a 12-day mission to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is one of optimism, with alliances flourishing, trade booming, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political and economic principles ascendant. There are other grading systems, of course. Not all of them are quite so enthusiastic about the first semester of the new administration. For example, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boasted of a bipartisan budget agreement that kept `` my no new taxes pledge intact,'' the deal does not deliver the decisive deficit curbs he also promised during the 1988 campaign. Indeed, some critics have called the deal a sham that simply puts off the day of budget reckoning until next year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was `` a strong first step.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed members of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Monday, two hours apart. The vice president's speech was, in his phrase, a `` pre-trip briefing'' on his trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. That turned out to fit one of his 100-day observations _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his biggest surprise was how much he enjoys foreign travel. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> script was an assessment of the first 100 days. His staff also turned out a 17-page background summary on accomplishments but skipped setbacks like <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejection of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination to be secretary of defense. The vice president answered questions from <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> member publishers, and said he senses a change in the way he is viewed and covered after a season of constant criticism. `` Now in the position of approaching the 100 days, I think the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are going to judge me on my job performance and that's the way it should be,'' he said. `` And I believe that's the way the news media is and will continue to cover me as the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I believe that's fair.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s account of what he has learned about that job, and about himself, since the inauguration sounded as though he'd been taking a refresher course in political science. `` ... I think what I have learned most about the job is what the true responsibilities of the office of vice president are and what the responsibilities of the office of president are,'' he said. `` I work every day in close contact with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I see how he formulates his policies. I'm there to give my opinions. I see the inner workings of the office of the president. So I have a much keener appreciation from a practical day-to-day operation how the two offices work.'' That plus a keener appreciation of traveling abroad on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 2. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that as a senator, most of his travel was back and forth to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, except for a couple trips to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said he's been surprised at `` how much I am enjoying myself in foreign policy travel ...'' to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and now to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> He said his foreign missions have had a very positive impact. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appraisal was a summary of proposals and plans, designed to counter complaints that his administration has drifted without a clear agenda. `` I think the work we've done these past three months demonstrates the value of tough, principled negotiations between this administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the president said. He cited the budget agreement, a deal for non-military aid to the Contras, the savings and loan reform and bailout bill that has passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, his ethics reform bill, the drive against drugs, his education and child care proposals. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said thorough reviews of foreign and defense policy issues will be completed late in May, pointing to strategies for a time of `` remarkable change in international affairs.'' The president said there's a running debate now on what it takes to move the nation forward. He said it takes principle, performance, ideology, action, `` and this administration understands that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people expect all of these _ and something more. `` They expect results.'' Results will be the final exam on each of issue. Those are the grades that really will count.

 The rules of the border rarely change. Despite the `` Not Welcome'' signs, Central American refugees keep coming. Despite the immigration service's recent crackdown and new detention camps, they stream by the thousand to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And despite criminal convictions, waning interest around the country and little money, Southside Presbyterian Church, home and heart of the sanctuary movement, is still welcoming and transporting refugees who want to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> home. This scraggly, pale blue barrio church spawned an international underground railroad seven years ago by declaring itself a sanctuary for illegal aliens. Now Southside is making another statement. The church plans to break ground this summer on an addition that will double its size and for the first time provide bedrooms for aliens, who have slept on the chapel's floor over the past seven years. The addition is a sign of the movement's uneasy truce with federal authorities, its survival despite eight members' felony convictions and its struggle to cope with the recent wave of new business. `` It's a recognition that we're in it for the long haul, that we're going through a transition from emergency assistance to institutionalizing this thing,'' said Southside's lanky, blue-jeaned minister, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>, the sanctuary movement's founder. `` We're still doing sanctuary, and we're doing so quite publicly.'' <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>, who is currently free on five years' probation, and others here have continued to sneak refugees across the U.S.-Mexico border about once a week, sheltering immigrants in Southside every night, and helping move them along to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In the last six months, church workers aiding aliens say they have seen a new wave of Central Americans heading north to escape war and economic troubles. The new flood of aliens and a resulting border crackdown in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> may well mean revival of the sanctuary movement, which federal authorities have declared dead, <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> and others said. `` In the last six months, we've sent more individuals into sanctuary congregations than the previous two years combined,'' <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> said. `` It's really picked up since the first of the year,'' agreed the Rev. <PERSON> Gustau </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanctuary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, the sanctuary movement has chosen to ward off the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> by staying out in the open. Federal officials are notified of all actions _ even plans to construct a new building. When there are mailings or notices, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is sent a copy. `` What we do on the border has become routine, almost bureaucratic,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>, a Quaker who helped found the movement with <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> and who was one of three acquitted in the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> trial. Sanctuary workers send letters informing the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> of each border crossing. Volunteers now fear stumbling into drug smugglers on the border more than <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents. Indeed, when the local jails or detention centers fill up, even the authorities deliver aliens to Southside, where they know they will be housed and fed. One night, three <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> police squad cars delivered 16 Guatemalans, <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> said. The federal government, which used informants and bugged Bible study groups to build its case in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, apparently pays the movement little attention now, as the nationwide network of sanctuary churches has largely faded away. Today, aliens prefer to slip into cities such as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or go on to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Most volunteers have gone on to other efforts. `` We're seeing a more contemporary manifestation of sanctuary,'' said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` It's really turning much more to some direct services, helping people find housing, assisting with medical care, education, jobs.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he recently polled some of the 500 congregations that had publicly declared themselves part of sanctuary in the mid-1980s. About 25 percent were still assisting some refugees. The others were asked if they were still willing. `` Some said yes, some no. I'd say more were willing than were not,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Along the border in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, only a handful of sanctuary activists continue moving aliens on their own, with help from established refugee shelters and a few churches. Most, intimidated by the government's actions, prefer to remain anonymous and secret. `` What is done here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is done very quietly,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Remer-Thamert </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, Lutheran minister acquitted of smuggling charges last year on the basis of former Gov. <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>'s 1986 state sanctuary declaration. <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> has only one declared sanctuary church, and it houses no refugees. A few people still secretly move refugees, but most of the work focuses on direct social services, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergquist </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Sanctuary Defense Fund representative. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials maintain those in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> who faced charges were smugglers. Although <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> meets with <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> and others, he warned, `` If somebody from my office encountered illegal activity, we would still today arrest them.'' <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> believe that since they have continued their activities and the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has not acted, they have established themselves as part of the quilt of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration. `` I think what we've established simply by keeping on is de facto acceptance of the church voluntarily protecting refugees and functioning as a human rights organization on the border,'' <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> said. As for the movement's relationship with the government, <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> does n't think the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> will plant informants again. `` There's no reason for them to infiltrate,'' he said. `` They're on our mailing list.

<HEAD>The Interest-Rate Chase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a long spell of rising interest rates, some financial advisers now contend that the time is at hand for a change in money-management tactics. The economy is slowing, they say, and interest rates are likely to start falling by midyear, if not sooner. If this is actually going to happen, how can savers and investors make it work to their advantage? First of all, never forget that forecasting interest rates is a guessing game in which no one has all the answers. You can consult your banker, broker, accountant or brother-in-law for an informed opinion. But, experts or not, none of these people can give you a sure-fire answer. Of course, an awareness of this uncertainty does n't obviate the need to make decisions based on your best guess about what the future holds. Savers with maturing certificates of deposit must pick a new place to put the proceeds. Many people buying houses face a choice between fixed - or adjustable-rate mortgages If you have a strong conviction that rates are headed substantially lower over an extended period of time, an adjustable mortgage might look especially appealing. No matter how hard it may be to practice it successfully, the operative rule in managing your savings is simple. If you think interest rates are going to decline, you emphasize investments with longer maturities that enable you to `` lock in'' today's prevailing rates. That might mean rolling over a maturing three-month or six-month certificate of deposit into, say, one that runs for 18 months, two years or even longer. Or it might mean switching some cash now sitting in a money market mutual fund into a fund that invests in intermediate - or long-term bonds Should rates decline, yields on money market funds would follow them down. Longer-term funds, by contrast, would benefit from an increase in the market value of the bonds they own, and those funds' net asset values per share should rise. Right now extending maturities does n't bring as much potential benefit as it traditionally does at this stage of the economic cycle. It turns out that many bankers also are expecting interest rates to be lower six months or a year from now. So at a typical institution, you may find that the going rate on, say, a 14-month CD is no higher, or even slightly lower, than what is offered on a seven-month CD. Still, picking a longer maturity assures you of a known return for a greater period of time. Is all the time and trouble involved in this exercise worth it? How much difference in dollars and cents does it make if you earn an extra fraction of a percentage point on your money for an additional year or two? For some people who need every dollar of income they can squeeze out of their savings, the effort may be a necessity. For others, it is a challenge with psychic as well as financial rewards. If you would rather devote your time to other things, however, there is a strategy to cushion the impact of interest-rate fluctuations on the return your savings earn. You could simply divide your money into equal short, intermediate and long-term piles. Whenever a CD or other investment matures, you order it automatically rolled over into a new one of the same kind and maturity. One nice thing about this sort of `` no-brain'' strategy: It assures that you wo n't outsmart yourself.

<HEAD>Does Steel Still Need Protection?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Resting on a cushion of $ 2 billion in earnings from last year, the steel industry hardly appears to be in need of protection. But some industry leaders say appearances deceive. While the domestic steel industry is again profitable, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> this week, `` it has not fully recovered from the depressed state of the 1982 to 1986 period.'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, made his comment in announcing first-quarter earnings of $ 296 million, an 89 percent increase over the similar period in 1988, aided partly by strong performances in areas other than steel. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> reported quarterly operating income of $ 137 million from basic steel operations, an increase of 40 percent from the $ 98 million profit earned in the first quarter of 1988. Figures such as these are n't likely to contribute to a resolution of what has become a perennial debate in the past two decades: Does the American steel industry, once the world's most powerful, need protection from imports? The issue, always a hot one, could burn political and business hides this time around. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated in his election campaign that he might consider continuing protection if foreign governments did n't end subsidies. Some of those who have been supporters, however, are among those who oppose protectionism. They concede that steel jobs are at stake and that steel is an industry vital to American defense. But they holler at the cost of protection. A report by the Center for the <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, indicates that current quota restrictions saved 17,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry jobs but destroyed 54,200 jobs in steel-using industries. The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, influential in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations, has issued a report exhorting the president to end quotas, claiming that `` five years of steel quotas have added $ 18 billion to the cost of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. steel.'' That figure, from a 1985 Office of Management and Budget estimate of the cost to the nation of four more years of so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements, caused <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> researcher, to observe trenchantly that `` VRAs have ` saved' 17,000 jobs, with salaries averaging $ 40,000 annually, at a yearly cost of $ 200,000 per job.'' The issue crosses the usual political support lines. It divides business too. Business people often lend support to each other on controversial matters. But a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recently denounced steel protectionism, saying `` we and our workers are paying the price.'' Looking back, some critics say protection never should have been granted, and that it enabled a backward industry to loaf instead of putting its house in order. But supporters say there would be no industry today without protection. The origin of supports goes back to the late 1960s, when more modern Japanese and European producers increased their shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, allegedly with their governments' help. American producers yelled `` dumping.'' In an effort to allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> producers time to modernize and otherwise become more competitive, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> arranged Voluntary Restraint Agreements limiting shipments by foreigners. They were to be temporary. During the 1970s steel production abroad grew while world demand fell. In 1977, Trigger Price Mechanisms were begun; if steel shipments into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell below a certain price, anti-dumping cases were triggered. When the TPMs expired in 1982, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government then put limits on steel from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Finally, in 1984 the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration went back to VRAs, which will expire in September _ unless extended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Years of training have enabled elected officials to juggle hot potatoes with ease and felicity. But this one's something else, less of a potato than a white-hot steel ingot, and it's being passed to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Iran Buys New Weapons, Rebuilds Battered Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite severe economic problems, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is spending up to $ 5 billion a year to rebuild its military now that a cease-fire has been declared in the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, analysts report. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also are warming and the fundamentalist Moslem regime is turning to the Soviet bloc increasingly for arms, apparently paying for tanks, artillery and other weapons with crude oil. `` Strengthening the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s defense capabilities is one of the major tasks we face during the reconstruction period,'' President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told senior military commanders at a recent conference. Both belligerents have large forces along the cease-fire line and, with peace talks deadlocked eight months after they began, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s rapid buildup is causing concern among Western officials. `` It's very worrisome. They're rebuilding much faster than we expected,'' a senior official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also is seeking new weapons to modernize its armed forces, and both countries have been developing their own arms industries, including missile production, since the cease-fire Aug. 20. Earlier this month, the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> Payam </PERSON> <PERSON> e-Enqelab </PERSON> said the missile firepower of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> will `` increase five-fold in the near future'' using domestically produced weapons with ranges of up to 100 miles. The American source said of the Iranian rearmament program: `` It appears they're talking in the range of $ 20 billion over the next 4-5 years. They've got serious economic problems and yet they're spending this kind of money on rebuilding their military The question is: to what end?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western officials said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s major arms suppliers in the latter stages of the gulf war, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, still are its main sources. Diplomatic sources in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region reported recently that the Chinese are helping <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> build a plant to produce surface-to-surface missiles. Al-Ittihad, a daily in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, quoted military sources last month as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would provide 40 new Silkworm anti-ship missiles, a reconnaissance satellite and batteries of HQ-2J surface-to-air missiles, the Chinese version of the Soviet SAM-2. Evidence increases, however, that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also is turning to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for Soviet-designed weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said most of the equipment is tanks, trucks, artillery and small arms rather than high-technology weapons. Gulf newspapers have said <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> would supply nearly 500 tanks, armored vehicles and tank transporters; help build a naval base on <LOCATION> Qeshm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, and convert a tractor factory <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION> to produce armored vehicles. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> will supply <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with 180 T-54 and T-55 tanks and help build a plant to make anti-tank weapons, the papers have reported. No independent confirmation of the reports was available, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has made trade agreements with several Soviet bloc states, including <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, providing for payment in crude oil. It has a similar pact with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, now the world's sixth largest arms exporter. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said only that the deals involve `` products and services,'' but analysts believe arms are involved. `` The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc will be swimming with T-54s and T-55s because of <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> force reductions and it makes a lot of sense that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be getting a lot of hardware from this quarter,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source's view, arms deals with the Soviet bloc `` have obvious advantages, including all-land transportation through <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> also has strengthened military links with its eastern neighbor <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a Moslem nation. The Pakistanis are developing their own arms industry and are advanced in the production of missiles and some other high-tech weapons. Both Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattari </PERSON>, the air force commander, and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> minister, visited <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> in recent weeks to meet with senior Pakistani military officials. `` We'll soon see the fruits of these talks, which have defense and other objectives,'' <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> said without elaboration. Official Iranian media have reported a defense allocation equivalent to $ 5.85 billion in this year's budget, described as about half last year's total. Reselat, a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> daily, said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> also approved a secret budget bill in which defense spending was considerably higher. Exiled opponents of the regime claimed to have a copy of the secret budget. They said it included $ 4.9 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and $ 3.6 billion for Revolutionary Guards. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, also told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> those figures did not represent <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s `` entire planned military spending,'' Analysts have estimated that, on the basis of such needs as combat jets, tanks, radars and missiles, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would spend about $ 5 billion a year on new weapons.

 A close aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> committed suicide Wednesday, a day after <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced he would resign because of the financial scandal embroiling his government. The aide, <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, was involved in financial dealings that linked <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> personally to the scandal. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, condemned in public opinion polls for the huge stock and bribery scandal, had announced Tuesday that he was resigning `` to restore the people's trust in government.'' <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, who had served as <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s personal secretary for three decades, took his life by cutting his wrists with a razor and hanging himself at his home. It quoted police as saying an ambulance crew, responding to an emergency call at 10:04 a.m., found <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> dead. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> headquarters confirmed the account that <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, 58, had slashed his wrists to kill himself. As <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s personal secretary, <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> handled political donations, stock transactions and loans, including those from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the company at the center of the scandal, that linked the prime minister to some of the deals. Last weekend it was disclosed that <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had accepted a $ 384,000 loan from the Recruit conglomerate in 1987 for use in <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s campaign to succeed <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> as prime minister The money was later paid back. Recruit is accused of seeking influence and favors by selling prelisted shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, through <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> and a relative, was a recipient of such shares that soared in value after they went on sale to the public in late 1986. Profits from selling the shares reportedly went into political funds. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> received 2,000 of the shares, which yielded a profit of the equivalent of $ 30,000. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> spend most of Tuesday meeting with other leaders of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to select a successor but no clear choice emerged. Whoever the party chooses as its new leader is assured of becoming prime minister because of the party's majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Japanese news reports said former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, now one of the party's three key leaders, was approached about acting as an interim prime minister. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75, is chairman of the party's Executive Council and untainted by money or stock questions. But he is diabetic, and said Tuesday that a younger leader should take over. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s news media reported Wednesday that <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> is the probable successor. The <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> daily said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and other party leaders virtually agreed Tuesday night that <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> should be selected. Another major newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, said a majority of party members considered <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> the only appropriate candidate. The question of timing also was unclear. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, 65, said he would resign after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passes the budget for the 1989 fiscal year that began April 1. But the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> over the stock-trading scandal. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would go ahead with a planned nine-day trip to five Southeast Asian nations beginning Saturday, indicating he hoped <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would pass the budget in early May. Other potential successors to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> include former Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, 84; ex-Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanemaru </PERSON>, 74; <PERSON> Masaharu </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotoda </PERSON>, 74, who served as a key aide to <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michita </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakata </PERSON>, 72, speaker of the House of Representatives. <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, both leading candidates when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was chosen party leader in November 1987, are considered out of the running now because of their own ties to the scandal. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> was one of three Cabinet ministers who resigned because of links to the scandal involving <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s giant <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information services conglomerate. In addition, prosecutors arrested 14 people, including two former vice ministers, on bribery or securities law violation. The Recruit scandal broke last summer with revelations the company had sold cut-price shares in a real estate subsidiary to more than 150 politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives. The shares, often bought with money lent by another Recruit subsidiary, yielded fat profits when sold after the subsidiary went public in 1986. Prosecutors are investigating politicians and aides who bought such shares from Recruit, which allegedly sought to influence government policy. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> acknowledged this month receiving more than $ 1 million in political donations from Recruit, but said they were legal. His decision to resign came after his further admission during the weekend that <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had borrowed $ 384,000 from Recruit. `` I could feel distrust among my constituents when I visited my home district,'' said <PERSON> Motoharu </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker. Adding to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s unpopularity was a 3 percent consumption tax. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> had pushed the tax through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as tax reform package that also included income tax cuts. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political opposition said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation was not enough. `` The only reasonable path is complete political reform,'' said <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Cabinet must resign en masse, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> must be brought to testify -LRB- about the Recruit scandal -RRB- under oath in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and new parliamentary elections must be called.'' Elections are scheduled this summer for half the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house, but the government does not need to call elections for the more powerful lower house until next year. The stock market also reacted calmly and positively to the news, rising 439 points or 1.34 percent, its third-largest gain this year. Traders said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement did away with some political and economic uncertainty.

<HEAD>Group Announces Seal Of Approval For Computer Interconnection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An influential group of computer makers and users has announced a seal that will certify computers that interconnect easily with other makes. Big computer buyers led by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the federal government demanded such a program because of dissatisfaction with the existing cacophony in communications between computers. The seal is called the COS Mark. The seal was unveiled Tuesday by the <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, Va.-based Corporation for Open Systems International, or COS. The organization touted the program as a step toward making computers `` interoperable'' _ that is, as easy to connect as telephones. The interoperability of computers, while helpful, does not solve the problem that programs for one computer still may not run on another. But it does help with things like sharing electronic mail and data files. While some basic communications standards have been set, high-level standards that cover things like how information appears on the screen and plugs into programs are still in flux. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, plagued by incompatible computers in its factories, has demanded that computer makers comply with the Map-Top interconnection standard. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> developed that standard, which has since been adopted by other users. The world's biggest computer user, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, has its own interconnection standard, which will be imposed on all would-be suppliers to federal agencies starting Aug. 15, 1990. The COS Mark seal of approval complies with both those standards, the organization said at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. The organization will have a testing program to decide whether computers and communication devices deserve its seal of approval, it said. `` There is no doubt that today's unveiling of the COS Mark program is one of the most important milestones, not only in COS' history, but in the history of the information services industry as well,'' <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Faurer </PERSON>, the group's president and chief executive, said in a written statement `` What they're trying to do is very ambitious. It's hard to set and implement a standard among competitors,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Modahl </PERSON>, an analyst of network strategy at <ORGANIZATION> Forrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Achieving interoperability is so difficult that engineers from competing companies may have to sit down together in some cases and work out problems identified by the COS Mark certifiers, she said. Products from three companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ were the first to receive the COS Mark under a trial certification program. Statements of support for the COS Mark program were issued by other companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Also backing the program were such users as <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Easy interoperability is a threat to the world's two biggest computer makers, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which traditionally locked customers into their own software and communication systems. But even those companies have been forced to adopt industry-wide standards because of their customers' demands. Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday their companies are active members of the Corporation for Open Systems and support the COS Mark program.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 100 million in damages as the court-appointed receiver for now-insolvent <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit seeks to recover damages due to alleged gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentations by the auditor, according to a news release Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. IMC, once <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest health maintenance organization, was declared insolvent and placed in receivership May 14, 1987. `` As a regulator, we rely upon companies to submit audited financial information that is accurate,'' State Treasurer and Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. `` If it is not, we ca n't do our job and carry out the law. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannix </PERSON>, associate general counsel for <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> at the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the Big Eight accounting firm had conducted <ORGANIZATION> IMC </ORGANIZATION> audits thoroughly and professionally. <PERSON> Mannix </PERSON> also said that <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s insurance department had been conducting its own examinations and was fully informed of events and developments at <ORGANIZATION> IMC </ORGANIZATION> before taking over the HMO. `` This phenomenon of regulators suing Big Eight accounting firms in an effort to blame the accounting profession for the regulators' own failings has become quite familiar lately,'' <PERSON> Mannix </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Recarey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> IMC </ORGANIZATION>, fled the country in 1987 in the face of indictments on federal charges including wire-tapping, bribery and embezzlement in the wake of the collapse of IMC. The insurance department also sued <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> in April 1988, claiming that the firm should have informed the state that <ORGANIZATION> IMC </ORGANIZATION> was due a $ 2.2 million federal income tax refund.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has been given two weeks to reach an accord with travel agents on a new policy for ticketholders seeking refunds due to the 7-week-old strike against the carrier. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who is overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 reorganization, held a brief hearing Tuesday on the matter. He then adjourned the session for two weeks. <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> <PERSON> Clement </PERSON>, an attorney representing Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said the airline will try to reach an accord with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> and plans to propose a new refund plan to the court in a few weeks. <ORGANIZATION> ASTA </ORGANIZATION> has petitioned the court to require Eastern to pay refunds on unused tickets to travel agents, who would pass the refunds on to their customers. The airline has said its debts include about $ 165 million in unused tickets issued before its March 9 bankruptcy filing in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court. Eastern estimates it sells 75 percent of its tickets through travel agents. Under Eastern's current policy, consumers holding unused tickets purchased before the Chapter 11 filing have several options but must apply for any refunds directly from Eastern. The customers can use the tickets to fly their original itineraries on existing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flights where available _ the carrier has been operating only about 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule _ or on sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> if seats are available. Alternatively, consumers can apply for refunds from credit card companies for tickets they charged on the cards or can apply to the bankruptcy court as unsecured creditors. Although airlines generally honor each other's tickets, charging a fee for the service, competitors stopped honoring Eastern tickets after it filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. `` There's a lot of hardship'' for Eastern ticketholders, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flug </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. The situation breeds ill-will toward the airline, <PERSON> Flug </PERSON> said. Consumers Union, the non-profit consumer advocacy group that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, has joined the travel agents' petition, seeking to broaden it to include passengers who purchased tickets individually rather than through agents The group has asked the court to require Eastern to reimburse those passengers before the company pays off other creditors. The Consumers Union request `` clearly requires the payment of more than the company can afford to pay,'' <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. At an earlier hearing Tuesday, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s director of cash management and credit, said the airline has about $ 183 million in cash on hand That reserve is expected to drop to about $ 107 million by the end of May, excluding proceeds from any asset sales made before then, he said. Eastern, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, told its major creditors Monday that it intends to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle service and its <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> hub as part of a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier. Those two sales, which must be approved by creditors and the bankruptcy court, would give <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> a cash balance of just under $ 500 million, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasgow </PERSON>, the airline's director of financial performance analysis, told the hearing that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is losing about $ 1 million a day. In a statement Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> criticized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s downsizing plan as unrealistic. The union, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots, most of whom have walked off the job, said the plan can not be realized because the company wo n't be able to hire and train the 1,700 pilots it says it needs. The union also questioned the carrier's belief that the plan would lead to profitability since the airline still would be saddled with high fixed costs.

The sale announced Tuesday came a week after the 157-year-old firm, a leading purveyor of debt securities called junk bonds, disclosed restructuring plans that included the sale of the retail network and a 33 percent cut in staff. The restructuring was prompted partly by bad publicity due to an intensive federal fraud probe of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the historic settlement of securities fraud charges stemming from the scandal that surfaced more than two years ago. The settlement raised the prospect that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> could lose its broker license in some states. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> would get 19 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> offices, including some of its largest retail branches, and about 500 of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest-producing account executives Neither firm disclosed a sale price, but Wall Street brokerage experts have said the entire division was worth $ 50 million to $ 200 million. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said it would sell the remainder of its 43-office brokerage network piecemeal and `` will be working with our branch people to assure the orderly transition of those offices.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> declined to say whether any sales were under negotiation or to elaborate on the fate of the 600 other account executives in the unsold offices. For <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, a 115-year-old firm with a stodgy image symbolized by television ads that its brokers `` make money the old fashioned way _ they earn it,'' the addition of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> offices and people would mark a major step in its effort to become a more powerful force in the brokerage business. <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> is a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified financial services company based in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The brokerage has said it wants to become bigger, more specialized and more profitable. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 25 cents Tuesday to close at $ 20.87 -LCB- a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said the offices to be sold to <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> include branches in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, La; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> will get the leases, furniture and fixtures in all branches as part of the deal. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was the biggest target of a federal investigation that grew out of revelations provided by stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the inside trader serving a three-year prison term. As part of an agreement to settle criminal and civil fraud charges, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 650 million in fines, plead guilty to six felonies and subject itself to unprecedented federal scrutiny of the way it does business. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is privately owned and does not disclose earnings or revenue figures, although it is considered one of Wall Street's biggest and most profitable firms <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has said the brokerage unit accounts for only about 10 percent of overall business and that its primary money-maker is the firm's leading role in the $ 175 billion junk bond market. The sale to <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> came a day after three <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> workers affected by the restructuring filed a class-action suit accusing the firm's top managers with breach of contract and violations of their duties. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions of dollars because they will be forced to sell their <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> stock for far below its true value. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> officials have declined to comment on the suit.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has introduced a dramatically smaller cellular telephone that can be carried in a purse or coat pocket. The device, half the size of any other portable cellular model, is about as wide and long as a checkbook. It is about as thick as a fat wallet at the earpiece while tapering down to half the thickness of a deck of cards at the mouthpiece. The phone, introduced here Tuesday, has a shorter-than-usual battery life. The 10.7-ounce model has a 30-minute rechargeable battery, while the 12.3-ounce one has a 75-minute battery. It needs no wires or base to operate. The device, called the <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to retail for $ 2,995 and be available six weeks after being ordered. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were taking orders immediately. `` This is a new category of cellular _ the personal cellular,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhart </PERSON>, vice president and director of distribution for <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s cellular subscriber group. `` We view it as the wave of the future.'' Officials of the <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, Ill.-based company would not reveal development costs for the new device, but said the company had invested about $ 350 million in development of cellular telephones. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisshappel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> vice president and director of the North American subscriber division, said the device has the identical range to the company's larger, Dynatac portable. Cellular telephones work as radio transmitters and receivers. Metropolitan areas offering cellular service are divided up into sections called cells, with each cell containing a receiving-transmitting antenna to connect many calls simultaneously with the local phone system. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 2 million cellular subscribers. Nearly 839,000 subscribers were added in 1988, the association said. In the last six months of 1988, cellular service revenues were $ 1.07 billion, and the average monthly cellular phone bill was $ 98.02, the association said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may have lost its bid to take over <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but Chairman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina-based </LOCATION> bank plans to continue its growth `` from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' `` It's a fact we're becoming a national company,'' <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` It's a fact that we're growing instead of dying.'' He added that <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> has no plans to expand outside the Southeast and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> predicted that large-scale mergers soon will become a necessity in the banking industry. `` We plan to become a major banking company in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> said. `` There will be far fewer players who are much larger. We will survive.'' <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> has no intention of resubmitting an offer for C & amp; S, calling his withdrawal of the $ 2.4 billion bid Monday `` the end of the saga.'' `` We have put this chapter behind us,'' he told reporters at a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> headquarters. The C & amp; S takeover would have been the largest bank merger in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, combining the assets of the biggest banks in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. With $ 76 billion in assets, the new bank would have been the nation's sixth-largest. On March 30, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>, which has more than $ 50 billion in assets, shocked the banking industry by launching the stock bid for the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> bank. When it appeared the takeover attempt was about to turn nasty, <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> dropped a bombshell on Monday by abruptly withdrawing the bid. `` We always wanted it to be a friendly deal,'' he said. `` We never said we'd do a hostile deal. When we could n't pull it off, we decided to withdraw.'' The withdrawal marked the second time that <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> failed to gain a foothold in the lucrative <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> banking market. The bank lost out to rival <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> took out full-page ads Tuesday in newspapers in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and several other large <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> cities in an apparent effort to explain its side of the takeover battle. `` If all you know about <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> is what you've been reading in the business section, you're missing a big, big part of what we're all about,'' the advertisement said. `` For example, we at <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> see a day when Southerners wo n't have to go outside the region to secure the capital they need,'' the ad said. `` We've already made loans that a few years ago no Southern bank could make. `` The way we look at it, being big is n't a goal,'' it said. `` It's a result of doing the absolute best we can for employees, customers, communities and shareholders.'' <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> deferred questions about the purpose of the ads. Just four months ago, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> effectively doubled its size when it was selected by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to acquire the largest bank in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1982, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> has expanded aggressively into new markets in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The First RepublicBank move was the biggest until the C & amp; S offer.

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bond trader has pleaded innocent to federal racketeering and fraud charges in two major Wall Street securities cases. Also Tuesday, a federal judge tentatively set the trial of former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> for June 30, but also scheduled a more likely March 1990 date. The former bond trader, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, 32, denied all charges made against him in a March 29 indictment that also targeted <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and charges in an August 1988 indictment of the defunct securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>. The two cases are considered the most prominent pending trials in the three-year government investigation of stock crimes developed from information provided by by jailed inside trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> already has agreed to set aside $ 1.6 million in assets _ equal to his 1987 salary _ to guarantee forfeitures he might have to make if convicted in the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> case under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act. Last year, <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> posted $ 2.5 million with the government in connection with the RICO forefeiture provisions in the Princeton-Newport case, which also charged five partners of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> securities firm. No bail was set in connection with the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> indictment because <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> already remains free on $ 250,000 bond in the Princeton-Newport case. His attorneys actually entered an innocent plea for him in that case in August, but he made a personal plea on Tuesday. Both pleas on Tuesday were entered before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. Lawyers have called the dual RICO indictment of <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> a rarity. Defense attorneys have indicated they plan to seek dismissal of all counts against <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> based on the constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy, which bars citizens from being tried twice on the same charges. The charges in the 98-count <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> indictment and the 35-count Princeton-Newport case parallel each other. They focus on a series of alleged stock manipulations and so-called stock `` parking'' schemes involving Princeton-Newport, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. Defense attorneys claim <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> was charged in both indictments in an attempt to pressure him into cooperating with prosecutors. The Princeton-Newport trial is to begin June 5. At a hearing Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> set the June 30 trial date for <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> because of federal criminal law procedures, but the additional March 1, 1990, date was considered more realistic because of the complexity of the case. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother have pleaded innocent to the charges, as have the five other Princeton-Newport defendants. <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> did not attend the original April 7 arraignment in the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> case because he was injured in a skiing accident. <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, who reported directly to <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield bond division in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was present for the arraignment at <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court. He made no remarks other than to plead not guilty to the judge.

 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will pay to clean up polluted drinking water for 9,000 suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> residents whose supplies have been tainted for the past year. State officials found <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Vanport </LOCATION> factory to be the source of the chemical pollution, although the company has not admitted specifically that it is to blame for the spread of trichloroethylene in the water table. The chemical, known as <ORGANIZATION> TCE </ORGANIZATION>, is a degreasing compound believed to cause cancer if ingested in large amounts over a long period of time. The chemical was discovered a year ago in wells near the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Vanport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The concentration in the water has since soared. Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday to supply water to authority customers while purifying facilities are built. The cleanup could cost <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> as much as $ 2 million at the outset. But the company has not yet set a figure since it has agreed to pay for permanent operation of facilities to remove the chemical as long as it continues to seep into the deep wells from which the water is drawn. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>'s Vanport plant makes circuit breakers used in commercial and industrial applications.

 A federal judge has picked Nov. 6 for the start of the third <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, who twice declared mistrials in the Wall Street corruption case, scheduled the November date Tuesday after meeting with lawyers for both sides. Prosecutors and defense attorneys had agreed on a September trial date but <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> had to push the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> trial back two months because she is already scheduled to preside over the stock manipulation trial of independent financial adviser <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> in September. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based chemicials and building materials manufacturer, and its vice chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, are accused of securities fraud and other criminal charges for an alleged scheme to manipulate the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock in October 1986. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, were indicted last July for allegedly trying to boost <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s stock shortly before unloading millions of Carbide shares acquired in an unsuccessful takeover attempt. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. If convicted of all charges, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and the subsidiaries face maximum fines totaling $ 12 million, or $ 500,000 on each of eight counts. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> faces up to 40 years in prison and fines totaling $ 2 million, if convicted on all counts. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> declared a mistrial Jan. 10 _ four weeks into the first trial _ because a prosecutor failed to disclose a report that concluded a major piece of evidence had been altered. A second trial with a new jury began Feb. 1. But on March 23, the second jury said it was deadlocked after 12 days of deliberations, prompting <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> to declare a second mistrial.

 <ORGANIZATION> S.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plans to spend $ 100 million advertising its new major weapon in the battle for dominance in the bug-killing market The Racine-based company, popularly known as <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>, unveiled Raid <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, its first major new line of insecticides since it introduced Raid in 1956. The company promised the new product would zap cockroaches not only on the prowl but in their nests and do the same to ants, fleas and other pests. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is No. 1 in the $ 500 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> household-insecticide business, with a roughly 47 percent share of the market. But in recent years, it has seen its share threatened by competitors, among them <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Shulton subsidiary. Shulton hopped into the roach market with Combat, a poison contained in small adhesive-backed containers that prevents roaches from digesting food. Since 1985, Combat has taken 12 percent of the market, according to trade publications. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>, however, thinks it has an answer. `` We've gone to the top chemical companies in the world and got state-of-the-art technology. That's the reason were saying that these are superior,'' <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, vice president of the insect-control division of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>, said Tuesday. `` This is a new generation of insecticides. The formulations are unique. These formulas have been specifically put together for heavy infestations.'' The Raid <PERSON> Max </PERSON> line is positioned as a premium product, with prices from $ 2.99 to $ 4.99 _ about $ 1 to $ 1.50 more than Raid products. The new line has four products: a roach-and-ant spray killer, a fogger, a roach bait and an ant bait. <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said consumer tests in three southern states showed that the products worked better than anything else available. Some analysts, however, were skeptical. `` They have n't brought out anything to date as good as Combat,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sober </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> anaylst. He noted Combat had $ 20 million in sales the first year on the market. It took <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> six years to develop <PERSON> Raid </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, and the company is banking on it to stabilize its insecticide sales. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, acknowledged earlier this year that sales were off about 8 percent in 1988 because of drought in several parts of the country. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>, with annual sales of about $ 2 billion, is a worldwide manufacturer of personal and homecare products.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index, overcoming a setback in early trading, shot up to a record high today, while the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen. The dollar ended at 131.47 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's 131.17-yen close It opened at 131.38 yen and fluctuated between 131.30 yen and 131.53 yen. The dollar had slipped 1.11 yen over the three previous trading days. The dollar gradually rose against the yen in connection with dollar-buying against the West German mark, said a trader with the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Many market participants remained on the sidelines to await the release later today of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product figure for 1989's first three months, he added. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained 438.86 points Tuesday, added another 190.15 points, or 0.57 percent, closing today at 33,434.93, a new high. Profit-taking following Tuesday's gain sent the index down 51.39 points in morning trading but it rebounded as institutional investors began buying up shares that had declined in the morning, analysts said. `` Of course -LRB- Prime Minister Norobu -RRB- <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s remarks -LRB- on his resignation -RRB- yesterday would n't remedy the whole thing, but investors expect that it at least will clear up some of the uncertainties,'' said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Amid growing public distrust in his government, tainted by a stock-profiteering and bribery scandal that surfaced last summer, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced Tuesday he would step down as soon as <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passes the fiscal 1989 budget. Investors reacted positively to this indication that the budget would be put through, <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> said. `` Some may think it strange that share prices started rising following the prime minister's announcement he would resign soon, but it lightened up market psychology,'' he said.

<HEAD>Incentives Give Car Sales A Lift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The big incentive packages introduced recently helped boost car and light truck sales by 5.4 percent in mid-April, but one analyst said automakers might have to cut production further to pare excess inventories. The eight companies making cars and light trucks in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said Tuesday that they sold vehicles at an average of 41,380 a day during the April 11-20 period this year, compared with a 39,257 vehicle-a-day rate in mid-April last year. Car sales were up 3.7 percent and truck sales rose 8.6 percent. `` I'm breathing easier today,'' said analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The selling rate is up and up against a good number a year ago, and it's part of what we need to get the inventories back in line.'' On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said they had trimmed their second-quarter and early third-quarter production schedules. The strategy is to combine sales inflated by incentives and production cuts to reduce inventories before the companies change manufacturing to the 1990 models later this year. `` It looks like they've made both of the necessary adjustments,'' <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> said. `` It should put them in better inventory shape when the model year rolls around.'' But analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was n't so sure. `` I do n't think the -LRB- production -RRB- cuts that have been made or 20 days of improved sales are going to be enough to solve the inventory problem,'' he said, adding that the cuts may have to go deeper and the incentives may have to be sweetened. `` I think the incentives are working,'' said analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I would have been surprised if it would have been anything else.'' The mid-April sales increase was n't evenly spread across the major makers. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales soared 14.5 percent, compared with a 1.5 percent decline for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and a 10.3 percent drop for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` What you have here is the strength of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s product momentum,'' <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> said. `` When you've got roughly comparable incentives, this is what happens. `` Chrysler, that's a lot tougher one to look at. You've got a lot of models which are n't in production right now'' and are sitting on dealer lots, he added. Automakers were looking for rising sales rates this month when they put on the newest incentive packages in late March and early April. March and April traditionally are strong vehicle buying periods, but last month proved to be weaker than expected. That prompted the Big Three to put on the new incentive packages, a bit of a gamble since the costs of low-interest financing and cash rebates come out of manufacturers' profits. For 1989, car and truck sales by the eight makers are running 3.9 percent behind the pace of last year, the second-best in industry history. Car sales are off 6 percent. Light truck sales are nearly even.

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> gained some ground on two fronts in its battle with hostile suitor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge turned down <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' effort to void some of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s defenses and the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> commerce commissioner ordered the oilman to provide more information on his plans. Chancellor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> rejected Tuesday <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' request for an injunction that would have barred <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, from issuing `` poison pill'' stock rights to shareholders before <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting May 15. But the judge left the door open to another legal challenge of the poison pill, which makes it more difficult and costly for a group to take over a company. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> indicated he would make a final determination on the legality of the pill within 45 days of the company's annual meeting. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to inform its shareholders that the pill might be invalidated later. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is offering to buy Northwest for $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90 a share. The <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board has rejected the offer as inadequate. A spokeman for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the oilman's investor group would have preferred an injunction, but nonetheless was pleased by the judge's order that shareholders be notified that the pill could be ruled illegal The decision means <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> could still succeed in acquiring the nation's fourth-largest airline if he can win control of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he had not fully reviewed the ruling and could not comment on it in detail, but `` It's fair to say we're pleased with it.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> got another blow Tuesday night from Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who gave <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' lawyers a Wednesday noon CDT deadline to give further details on the takeover bid. `` The financial statements given to the bank, the lenders, I think ought to be made available to the shareholders so at least the offering becomes believable in terms of the ability of the acquirer to operate an ongoing airline,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. Under a 1984 state law, the registration of the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> offer must be reviewed by the commerce commissioner. If <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> decides that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has not made a sufficient explanation of his plans, the commissioner can order the offer be suspended. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandeman </PERSON> said after the hearing he would try to convince <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> that the disclosures of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' financial plan for the Eagan-based airline are adequate and accurate <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said he would issue a ruling by 6 p.m. Wednesday if one is needed. If he issues a suspension order, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would have a chance to appeal it at a Thursday night hearing at the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vandeman </PERSON> said a suspension would not delay <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' effort to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board of directors on Monday unanimously rejected <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' bid, charging that the offer is unfinanced and in part illegal under securities laws But the board said it is willing to negotiate with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and other qualified bidders. In other developments, the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board decided, at least temporarily, against a planned $ 1.6 billion order for new planes. Instead, it authorized its plane-leasing subsidiary to buy 10 used DC-10s and 14 used DC-9s to lease to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and other carriers.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, surpassing the $ 5 trillion mark for the first time, expanded at a robust annual rate of 5.5 percent in the first three months of 1989, the fastest pace in more than a year, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that almost half of the increase in the gross national product came from a statistical catch-up from last year's drought. But even discounting this bookkeeping factor, the GNP, representing the country's total output of goods and services, advanced at a 3 percent annual rate, down only slightly from a 3.5 percent non-farm growth rate in the final three months of 1988. The dollar fell against most major currencies in domestic trading after the release of today's report, while bond prices were mostly lower. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hailed the GNP report as good news that the economy is continuing to expand at a healthy rate. Officials noted in particular the fact that the trade deficit, which had been widening for two consecutive quarters, showed improvement again in the first three months of the year while business investments rose at the fastest pace since last spring. `` There is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989 from these numbers,'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villamil </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist, said at a news briefing. `` We are getting solid, moderate growth with the kind of mix we need at this stage of the expansion.'' The non-farm growth was slightly better than economists had been expecting. Most analysts believe the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy will slow substantially this year under the weight of higher interest rates. For the past year, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing rates higher in an effort to fight rising inflationary pressures. However, the report contained information that inflation is rising. A GNP price index which measures a fixed marketbasket of goods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the first quarter, up from a fourth-quarter rate of 4.2 percent. Half of the increase came from a pay raise for federal employees, with rising food and home costs accounting for much of the rest of the increase. The 5.5 percent overall increase in the GNP was more than double the 2.4 percent advance in the October-December quarter, the last period in which output was held back because of the lingering effects of last summer's drought. With the start of the new year, the government returned its estimate of farm output to normal levels, thus accounting for 2.5 percentage points of the 5.5 percent increase in the first quarter. Economists expect growth for the remainder of the year to slow dramatically as the economy adjusts to the year-long credit tightening done by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and some private economists have begun to express fears that the central bank could overdo its anti-inflation battle and risk pushing the country into another recession. However, other analysts believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be able to engineer the tricky `` soft landing'' in which interest rates rise enough to dampen inflaionary pressures but not enough to choke off the six-year-old recovery, the longest in peacetime history. Today's GNP report showed that the country's total output climbed to $ 5.117 trillion, the first time in history it topped the $ 5 trillion mark. This figure is before inflation is taken into account. After adjusting for inflation, the GNP rose $ 54.8 billion in the first quarter to $ 4.088 trillion. This figure is expressed in 1982 dollars. The 5.5 percent GNP increase was the largest advance since a 6.1 percent jump in the fourth quarter of 1987. For all of 1988, the GNP rose 3.9 percent, the best performance in four years. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, counting on continued strong growth to help reduce the federal budget deficit, is forecasting that growth in 1989 will dip only slightly to 3.2 percent. However, many private economists believe that forecast is far too optimistic and total growth for the year will be 2.7 percent or less, a sluggish rate which would not be enough to keep unemployment from rising. The first quarter GNP report provided some evidence that the economy was slowing. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, rose at a rate of just 1.3 percent, the slowest advance in more than a year. Purchases of durable goods such as autos actually fell by 3.2 percent in the first quarter while purchses of products not expected to last three years edged up 2 percent. Housing construction, another key consumer sector, dropped at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the first quarter, the first decline in a year as the housing industry suffered under the impact of rising mortgage rates. While these two key sectors were flashing signals of a slowdown, other segments of the economy demonstrated strength from January through March. The country's intractable trade deficit, which had actually been rising for two consecutive quarters, posted a modest improvement in the first quarter as a 10.6 percent rise in exports was enough to offset a 2.3 percent increase in imports. In a separate report, the government said that corporate profits, after taxes, increased 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, slighlty better than the previous report which had put the increase at 2.8 percent. The latest survey of 50 top economists issued each month by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, an investment newsletter, showed that more than half of the panel now expect a recession to begin by late this year or early next year. The Blue Chip consensus forecast calls for GNP growth this year at a lackluster rate of 2.7 percent.

The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> researchers said they placed electrodes of platinum and palladium in a flask of deuterium oxide, or heavy water, and then applied an electrical current to the electrodes. They said the setup split the heavy water into atoms of deuterium and oxygen and forced deuterium nuclei into the crystal lattice structure of the palladium metal. After operating for a number of hours, the researchers said, the experiment caused deuterium to become so compressed within the metal that the nuclei fused. This reaction, they said, produced heat energy equal to about four times the amount of energy used to cause the fusion. The announcement stunned the international physics community, which has spent millions of dollars over the last 25 years attempting to achieve fusion using massive, multimillion-dollar machines filled with plasmas heated to temperatures of up to 100 million degrees. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischman </PERSON> appeared before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee today in a room packed with spectators, journalists and representatives of other laboratories. The two defended their work before sharp questioning by committee members who probed not only the findings of the experiment but the manner in which the researchers announced their work. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said follow-up articles detailing how the experiment is being conducted will be published in scientific journals. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said part of the controversy revolves around the different way in which chemists and physicists announce the results of their work. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments have come under heavy criticism from fusion experts because the precise details needed for duplication of the work have not been released. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said that typically physicists will circulate a pre-publication copy of their research to colleagues, who will informally review it. `` For chemists, it is done in a different way,'' he said. `` The review is left up to the journal.'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said that in one experiment researchers have been able to cause water to reach the boiling point. He added, however, there was still much work yet to be done to develop a way of harvesting useful energy from this process. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> researchers said they built their initial experiment for about $ 100,000, but <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said `` production of a scale-up device will cost about 10 times that'' and that the next phase, where useful energy was actually developed, `` would cost millions.'' The researchers also said it could take years to turn the cold-fusion process into a useful energy source. `` We think it is feasible but it will require a very high effort,'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said. One of the elements to be investigated, said <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, is the metal that can be used in cold fusion. The palladium used by the Utak researchers is an expensive metal that is available in only a few places on Earth. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said other experiments are under way to find if other metals can be used. `` Palladium may be the best choice but there may be also other possible choices,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> was planning to use today's hearing to request $ 25 million from the federal government toward a $ 100 million institute devoted to commercializing the process, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. While such lobbying for funds is not new, it is highly unusual for researchers to seek congressional support before their findings have been confirmed, the newspaper said. The day-long hearing was to include at least three nuclear physicists who have reported that they have been unable to duplicate the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments. In testimony released to the committee, scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> all expressed strong and sharp skepticism and doubt about the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments actually achieving nuclear fusion. Researchers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have reported what may be fusion reactions, but many other laboratories have reported failed efforts. Scientists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> reported experiments with reactions that may be fusion. Many experts believe fusion to be the ultimate energy source. The nuclear process is the opposite of the fission reaction that now powers atomic generating plants. Fission occurs by splitting atoms and the process leaves behind highly radioactive spent fuel. Fusion derives its energy by forcing atoms of deuterium or hydrogen together. The reaction produces an atom of helium, a burst of energy and a neutron. Experts believe fusion energy would produce a much smaller amount of radioactive waste, and that fusion power plants could be operated with deuterium oxide, or heavy water, a chemical that can easily be extracted from seawater. Natural fusion energy is the power that causes the sun and the stars to shine. Stellar fusion is created when the massive force of gravity in stars forces hydrogen atoms to fuse, giving off heat, light and helium. Most `` hot'' fusion research is an attempt to duplicate the pressure and heat process seen on the sun.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> grappled today with a $ 4.7 billion domestic spending bill, and a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> plan to pay for it with savings from defense and other programs drew a veto threat from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The measure would provide money for this year for anti-drug programs, veterans and college students, and was defended by Democrats as a way to provide badly needed money for important priorities. Republicans said the bill was loaded down with unnecessary spending that could wait until next year. But it was a plan by the chamber's majority Democrats for saving money that drew the most fire. The Democrats proposed saving $ 1.4 billion by cutting most federal programs across-the-board by 0.57 percent. The plan would pare $ 1 billion from defense, $ 353 million from domestic and $ 43 million from foreign aid this year, according to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> estimates. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director, said he would urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to veto the measure if defense spending was cut and if the `` fiscally irresponsible'' overall bill was not reduced in size. And in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the military cuts would do `` enormous damage'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s personnel, operations and maintenance, and research programs Republicans planned to propose a money-saving amendment of their own, which would reduce portions of the bill and cut many domestic programs, but would leave defense spending alone. With Democrats controlling the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, predicted, `` I anticipate that the leadership amendment prevails.'' Critics have complained that without reductions, the spending bill would push this year's deficit beyond its projected total of $ 163 billion. The fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Only $ 1.4 billion of the bill's total spending would occur this year. The rest would not actually be spent until future years. Excluded from cuts under the Democratic plan would be domestic programs in which spending is required by law, such as benefits paid to poor people or to the elderly. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has yet to consider the spending measure. Meanwhile, members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> held a closed-door session Tuesday to work on a budget resolution for the 1990 fiscal year. The spending plan, which the panel expects to complete Thursday, is expected to resemble closely the $ 1.2 trillion document the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adopted last week. It will also reflect the savings and spending totals set in the budget deal worked out earlier this month between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders. According to documents provided by a participant in Tuesday's meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan is likely to increase <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> spending levels for education, health and community development programs, while reducing expenditures for energy, agriculture, and law enforcement

 <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today it is planning to launch a daily commercial-free news program for schools in August, challenging one containing advertising that was recently tested by <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>. Turner Chairman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> told a news conference that his <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> would begin offering the daily 15-minute program for schools, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsroom </ORGANIZATION>, starting Aug. 14. Whittle is evaluating the results of the test of its news service, <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION>, in hopes of expanding it nationally in the fall of 1990. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he decided at the last minute against including any advertising because of some educators' objections. He said he had planned to allow corporate sponsors to buy time to deliver public service messages such as ones encouraging literacy and discouraging school dropouts and drug abuse, but changed his mind today after discussions with education officials. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the company was profitable and would absorb the multimillion-dollar expense of the program. `` Helping students learn to cope with an increasingly complex and sometimes threatening world through daily news and information programming is a natural next step for us,'' he said in a written statement. Representatives of cable operators <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intercable </ORGANIZATION>, which serve 50 million households, said they would provide the Turner service free of charge to schools in their areas. In contrast to the Whittle service, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s does not envision major donations of video equipment and televisions to schools. The program will be broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> in the early-morning hours, recorded by the schools and shown to students during the day. At the press conference, <ORGANIZATION> cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> networks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Entertainment, C-Span and The Discovery Channel said they planned to expand their own educational programming and see that cable operators provided it free to schools. The <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based Whittle launched Channel One, a daily 12-minute news show with two minutes of paid advertising, in six test schools March 6. The schools were each given about $ 50,000 in video equipment, TV monitors and satellite dishes in exchange for agreeing to run the program every school day. Some education groups have complained about the advertising on Channel One, saying students should not be subjected to paid pitches for candy bars, jeans or anything else while they are in the classroom. But many of the teachers and students involved in the test have said they considered the advertising a reasonable price to pay for the equipment and the topical programming. Turner has been involved for two years in a venture called `` News Access'' that has made <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Week in Review'' program available to schools along with a detailed classroom guide with suggestions on how to use portions of the show in class. C-Span, the <ORGANIZATION> Discovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Entertainment each have previously made separate arrangements for sharing programs with schools. But none of those efforts has drawn the attention that Whittle's Channel One test did Whittle is reviewing the results of the seven-week test ended last week and hopes to decide by mid-summer whether to make the program available nationally in as many as 10,000 schools in the fall of 1990.

 A federal appeals court today refused to remove a roadblock to the final settlement of civil securities fraud charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The settlement <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> reached with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month has been blocked from final approval because of a legal challenge to the district judge presiding over the case. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> asked the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to modify its stay of all proceedings before Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> civil case to allow another judge to consider and possibly approve the settlement. But the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> said `` that decision does not rest with us'' and refused to intervene. The decision means that the landmark settlement of civil securities fraud charges against the Wall Street investment giant remains in limbo. Resolution of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact also is needed before <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> can formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay $ 650 million to settle criminal charges brought by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys office. The appeals court declined to reconsider or clarify its ruling pending a possible <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on whether <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> should be removed from the case on grounds that he has a conflict of interest. The 2nd Circuit has issued a stay on all proceeding before <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> pending a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has not yet decided whether it will hear the appeal. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> sought to sidestep the stay by asking the 2nd Circuit to let another judge handle the settlement. But the 2nd Circuit held that `` a decision to assign the case, or any part of the of it, to another judge rests with Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> or with those responsible for the assignment of cases'' at the district court level in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Indicted former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> sought to bar <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> because his wife had an interest in a company involved in a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> transaction. `` Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> is entitled to remain in this case, absent a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling to the contrary or new facts which would warrant his -LRB- removal -RRB-,'' the appeals court said. The Milkens, who were not included in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement, also have appealed the criminal settlement alleging it illegally forces <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to withhold their multimillion-dollar 1988 salaries and dismiss them. The two-page appeals court ruling appeared to put new pressure on <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, who refused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s attempts to disqualify him, to step aside. `` So long as Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> remains assigned to this case, we must accept his position as part of the status quo,'' said the 2nd Circuit. `` It was in this context that we ruled earlier that the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> group has a right to have the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> determine whether Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> should remain in the case before he is allowed to consider a proposed settlement which may affect the interests of the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> group,'' the three-judge panel said. As part of its settlements with both the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is required to fire <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and suspend his brother, and not engage in business dealings with either brother.

 A $ 400 million blend of big-league filming and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stargazing debuts Monday when <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s top entertainment resort opens the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, a 135-acre playground with diversions that range from do-it-yourself music videos to a 1950s sitcom set. The complex at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> combines working movie-TV sound studios with backstage tours for the public, a mixed-media ride-through show and other special effects adventures. `` It is a theatrical environment that is very close to the original conception by <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said in an interview. `` It's been on the shelf since the 1940s and is the culmination of a company dream. This attraction is unlike anything else we have.'' It's all themed to the golden age of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the 1930s and 1940s, when tyrannical cigar-chomping moguls ran studios and art deco dominated the building scape. Mom, dad and the kids can walk through re-creations of palm-lined <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION>'s Chinese Theater, peek at movies under production, take a role in a television show, make their own music videos, get a screen test and rub elbows with the stars at the <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> restaurant. Movie and TV production began last summer with the `` Superboy'' syndicated TV series and parts of several large-screen films while construction continued on the tourist portion. The event was preceded by glitzy parties and previews that included a television special, a parade of famous Hollywood actors and actresses on the boulevard and live tapings of a mew `` <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' TV series. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attractions </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes bringing a bit of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will reinvigorate the resort, already visited annually by an estimated 25 million people that reportedly pump about $ 2 billion into the area's economy `` We talked of doing a studio tour when <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> was alive,'' said <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>. `` We've wanted to do this for a long, long time. It's a dream come true.'' Disney will get a year's jump on some formidable competition in the high-stakes family entertainment business, in which the company founded by the late cartoonist has emerged as one of the undisputed leaders. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> is building a rival $ 500 million complex to be finished next May. Just a few miles away, Universal is billed as the nation's largest working studio outside of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> Movie and TV production already is under way at the 440-acre facility owned by <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Universal will feature what it calls a `` total experience'' of Hollywood-style filmmaking to the public, making the visitor a participant in the action. It expects to attract up to 6 million visitors a year. Despite their well-publicized rivalry, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> officials insist the competition is good for each other as well as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where family-oriented entertainment has become one of the dominant industries. `` We've always had competition _ from <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> and Baseball and many others,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. `` We welcome competition. It's good for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Disney does things in its own way, and we feel comfortable that we will have our niche in the community.'' The Disney-MGM theme park is the centerpiece of a $ 1 billion-plus renaissance of the 27,400-acre resort in the pine woods and citrus groves of central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, once populated largely by alligators and armadillos before it opened 18 years ago. Not that a rebirth is needed. `` We're having a phenomenal year in both -LRB- hotel -RRB- occupancy and -LRB- theme park -RRB- attendance,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> publicist <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>. After achieving a record $ 3.4 billion in revenues and $ 522 million in profits in fiscal 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> has on tap a number of `` openings'' at its <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> resort this year besides the studios. On schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the largest convention-hotel complex in the Southeast. Making their debut this summer will be Typhoon Lagoon -LRB- `` the world's largest water park'' -RRB- and the <LOCATION> Pleasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nighttime entertainment district. Built for the teen-age crowd, <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON> says Typhoon Lagoon will make all other water attractions as obsolete as <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> made amusement parks in 1955. `` We're finally going to be able to make waves,'' says <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>. `` Surfing, a 100-foot mountain, a saltwater snorkling reef, including sharks and other live critters -LRB- in an enclosed area -RRB-. I can hardly wait to put on my bathing suit.'' Pleasure Island is for those who still have energy left at the end of an exhausting day at the Disney-MGM Studios park, <LOCATION> Epcot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> or the Magic Kingdom. The complex of restaurants, shops and nightclubs is built on a six-acre island at the Disney Village. Opening this fall is the 770-room Swan Hotel, which along with the larger <ORGANIZATION> Dolphin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> will form the lodging side of the convention-hotel complex near <LOCATION> Epcot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. The 1,500-room Dolphin is to open in July 1990. The more modestly priced Caribbean Beach Resort hotel opens an additional 800 rooms this summer for a total of 2,112. The 907-room Grand Floridian Beach Resort, a luxury Victorian-style hotel, opened last summer. Also set for completion this fall will be a new Epcot pavilion, the Wonders of Life, featuring a simulated ride through the human bloodstream and a movie that takes a viewer from conception through birth. All Disney's doings are coming together during a busy start for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tourism this year. More than 3.4 million tourists visited the state in January, an 18.6 percent increase over the first month of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> says. State tourism officials predict the number of visitors will increase 6 percent this year. That means the state would host 38.7 million tourists, vs. 36.6 million in 1988. Disney's <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> attributes the improved season to a generally strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and a larger number of foreign tourists. For local Floridians, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s building spree is one of the main economic engines providing jobs. One of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s most-popular spots is the employment office, currently hiring 2,500 new workers at a minimum pay of $ 5 an hour to help staff new attractions that will swell the Disney complex's workforce to about 28,000, nearly twice the level of eight years ago The new attractions also have prompted a $ 1 increase in one-day admission prices at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center and the introduction of a new four-day passport good at any of the three theme parks, effective Monday. The new ticket will cost $ 94 for adults and $ 77 for children 3 to 9 years old. It provides unlimited admission to the three parks for four days. New single-day admission prices for any one park will be $ 29 for adults and $ 23 for children.

 Police arrested about 100 striking union members today for trying to block a coal mine, and hundreds of supporters interfered with buses taking the miners away, officials said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> were arrested at the entrance to the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>. `` We took them away in buses and tried to disembark them for processing at several places in <LOCATION> Dickenson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> but were turned away because of crowd control problems,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. He would not disclose where the bus ended up. Strike supporters at a Clintwood elementary school continued a rally after turning away buses, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. `` Everbody's dressed in camouflage, there're hundreds of people standing there clapping and cheering at the miners in the buses,'' said a woman in the county clerk's office who would not give her name. `` You'd never know this many people lived in <LOCATION> Dickenson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' The escalation in the union's 3-week-old strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has resulted in hundreds of arrests and a walkout by about 150 high school students since Monday. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said at least 200 miners and relatives were arrested Tuesday for sitting in the entrance and blocking traffic to and from a coal preparation plant. Union officials estimated the number at 380. State Police made several trips with at least four buses and several vans before they could remove the protesters and reopen the truck entrance to the plant. Some pickets were dragged across the road to the waiting buses. About 200 miners were arrested Monday during a sitdown at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> mine, touching off a daylong rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Dickenson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> by the miners' friends and relatives that closed downtown Clintwood. On Tuesday, about 150 students walked out of class at high schools in <LOCATION> Dickenson </LOCATION> and Wise counties to join the rally.

 The stock market was little changed today in a inconclusive response to the latest data on the state of the economy.

<TEXT>
 Prices closed sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday as favorable British trade figures helped to calm the market's fears of an imminent rise in interest rates. The trade report propelled the <ORGANIZATION> key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index briefly above the 2,100-point level, the top of the recent trading range and an important level both psychologically and for those charting the market's progress. But the index later drifted back as buying interest was n't sustained At the close, the index was up 22.2 points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,093.4. Volume was relatively high, with 567.7 million shares changing hands, compared with 577.7 million shares on Tuesday. The government reported that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had a current account deficit in March of 1.19 billion pounds, or $ 2 billion. This was considerably lower than February's deficit of 1.7 billion pounds, and well below market expectations of a 1.5 billion-pound gap. Analysts cautioned, however, the report might merely have bought some time, noting that inflationary pressures in the economy could still force official interest rates higher at a later point.

<HEAD>Dollar Rising In Europe, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar ended higher against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar in European trading Wednesday. Gold prices declined. Foreign exchange dealers said sentiment toward the dollar remains bullish, although trading was not affected by the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures released Wednesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said the gross national product figures expanding at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.5 percent, larger than expected. `` I have no explanation for the dollar's rise but people want to buy dollars,'' said <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank dealer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION>. The British pound rose initially on the narrowing of the trade deficit in March to $ 2 billion from $ 2.8 billion in February, since a larger deficit had been expected. But the pound eased with the consequent lessening of pressure for an upward revision of British interest rates as a counter-inflationary measure. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6932 late Wednesday, cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late $ 1.7030. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Tuesday's late rates: 1.8770 West German marks, up from 1.8625; 1.6555 Swiss francs, up from 1.6435; 6.3395 French francs, up from 6.3065; 2.1150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1000; 1,374.00 Italian lire, up from 1,366.00; and 1.1900 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1910. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 131.47 Japanese yen from 131.17 Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Wednesday the dollar traded higher at 132.00 yen. Gold bullion prices fell. The late gold bid price in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 384.25 a troy ounce, down from $ 385.75 late Tuesday. The Zurich late bid price was $ 383.50 an ounce, down from $ 385.00. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 384.55 an ounce, down from $ 385.65.

<HEAD>Blimpie Goes After Health-Conscious Consumers With New Low-Cal Menu</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Blimpie </ORGANIZATION> is going skimpy on calories. The fast-food restaurant known for submarines heaped with meats and mayo said Wednesday it is expanding the menu to include low-calorie sandwiches and salads in an attempt to woo calorie-conscious consumers who might otherwise be avoiding fast food. Industry analysts and nutritionists say the additions _ which include seafood, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, chicken and low-calorie mayonnaise _ is a response to increased public interest in healthier food, even though such traditional fast-foods as hamburgers and french fries remain king. But experts also said past attempts at healthier fast food have produced mixed results, even though most chains now offer salads or other `` light items.'' `` We feel there's a mounting hunger for variety among the public,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Conza </PERSON>, chairman of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Astor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Blimpie </ORGANIZATION>'s parent. `` The <PERSON> Blimpie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lites </PERSON> appeal to those customers we feel have abandoned fast food because of the calories,'' <PERSON> Conza </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Conza </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Astor </PERSON> executives were in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to unveil the new menu to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> franchise operators. The Blimpie Lite menu will be test marketed in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> beginning in June and will be introduced in the chain's 14 other states later in the year. <ORGANIZATION> Blimpie </ORGANIZATION>'s regular menu, including 12 sandwiches as well as salads, will remain in effect at the chain's 350 outlets. The new items, developed with the Boston-based Diet Workshop chain of weight-control facilities, each have less than 300 calories. They include tuna, seafood and crab, chicken, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> and tova fish stuffed into whole wheat pita bread or spread on a salad. The sandwiches will have low-calorie mayonnaise and the salads will have vinegar dressing. `` It fits in with the whole movement in the food industry, not just fast food, to offer good-tasting, low-calorie, low-fat items,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, who follows the industry for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said introduction of such items in fast food outlets has produced mixed results, with a major flop being D'Lites, a <LOCATION> Norcross </LOCATION>, Ga.-based nutritious fast food chain that filed for bankruptcy in 1986. `` People think about eating healthy, but they do little about it,'' he said. `` Clearly, there has n't been an across-the-board ramp-up of people buying only low-calorie, healthy foods. `` My guess is the demographics of the average Blimpie customer wo n't fit into someone who is calorie - or fat-conscious. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbloom </PERSON>, associate professor in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dietetics </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said consumer demand has forced the fast food industry to offer alternatives to its basic menu items. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosenbloom </PERSON> also credited consumer groups, such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest, for alerting people to the content of fast food and noted many chains such as McDonald's now have registered dietitians at the corporate level

 A travel boom in the <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region has touched off a scramble among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Asian airlines for business in a market growing at twice the pace elsewhere. There's a competitive atmosphere in which government policy and underlying trade friction can have as much to do with an airline's bottom line as the allure of <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' romantic advertising or the upgraded, Japanese-speaking service touted by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Some Asian airlines complain at what they call unfair advantages enjoyed by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> but they want equal privileges in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market rather than to retaliate against the far-flung networks of the big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. `` We do n't fear the size of these big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers but we're worried about the frequency of their stops in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region,'' said <PERSON> Nares </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovatanakul </PERSON> of Thai Airways International in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> `` We would like to see reciprocity, not retaliation, because that would not be fair business.'' The Thai spokesman said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government negotiators refused to permit more than five weekly flights by the Thai carrier to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> international airport. `` They wo n't lift this restriction and we feel that fair competition is halted,'' he said. Everyone wants more landing rights, especially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Japan-U.S. routes are the most lucrative, heavily used by business travelers as well as by the fast-growing number of Japanese tourists. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, meanwhile, complain in varying degrees about poor Japanese facilities and hindrances by the Japanese government. `` <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> is the most congested airport in the world,'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> McAvoy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' vice president for the Far East. He said <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, only 10 years old, and a new airport under construction at <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> were structured `` as very sophisticated non-tariff barriers.'' `` By pleading a lack of facilities, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in effect is in a position to curtail competition,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s tactic is to use the island of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> as a hub rather than <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>. To avoid <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>'s crowded check-in area, the airline will pick up first - and business-class passengers at their <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> hotels and drive them to <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> in luxury vans, checking them in during the ride Such competitive wrinkles _ <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> offers a concierge to shepherd business - and first-class passengers _ reflect the scramble for well-heeled Japanese travelers `` They are a wonderful consumer to do business with once you earn their loyalty,'' said <PERSON> McAvoy </PERSON>. Statistics from 1987, the most recent year obtainable, show 12.5 million people arriving and departing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on routes to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> including <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The number of Japanese travelers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled 1.7 million in 1986 and 2.4 million in the first 11 months of 1988. An economic boom that extends to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is behind the increase in travel, and it's fueled by decisions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to permit their citizens to travel abroad more freely. `` We see overall Pacific travel growing 10 to 12 percent a year,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Speicher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> operations, `` and we believe it will continue indefinitely in the future, while air traffic in the rest of the world is forecast to grow about 5 percent a year.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has aggressively sought permission to fly the <LOCATION> Chicago-Tokyo </LOCATION> route nonstop but was recently turned down by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The issue will come up in U.S.-Japan talks on air rights scheduled for mid-May. What will <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s attitude be? <PERSON> Norifumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ide </PERSON>, deputy director for international air transport in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, said the two countries' airlines are now balanced on the route: <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Air Lines and Northwest each can fly Chicago-Tokyo nonstop. Ide hinted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will reject <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s request, though there might be some flexibility if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> permits Japanese cargo flights on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> route. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, have enjoyed a monopoly for many years in that important cargo market,'' <PERSON> Ide </PERSON> said. `` We always table it -LRB- in U.S.-Japan negotiations -RRB-. It is a symbol of the imbalanced relationship in favor of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Speicher </PERSON>, speaking in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, implied a willingness to see more competition than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government now permits. `` We will have to find ways in negotiations to accommodate both sides.'' <PERSON> Speicher </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which carried 1.2 million trans-Pacific passengers in the first half of fiscal 1988, a 10.3 percent increase over the comparable period a year earlier, urges that competition not be unleashed as happened in the deregulated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation market. `` The industry would be dragged into the chaos of price wars and oversupply,'' <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Yoshiyasu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> warned in a recent speech. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has a chart showing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines with all the advantages: 19 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gateway cities to 11 permitted to Japanese carriers; five points in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to three used by Japanese trans-Pacific flights; nine `` beyond points'' in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers but only one -LRB- Rio de Janeiro -RRB- permitted to Japanese airlines flying to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines compared with three Japanese; 380 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights in and out of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> each week to 210 for Japanese airlines. One <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, asking not to be named, criticized what he called `` predatory American carriers coming in and ripping off our backyard.'' The Americans disagree. Northwest's <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>, said that <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> `` also uses <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> for a hub to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and other points, so there is a similar route pattern -LRB- to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines -RRB-. We do n't feel like everything is balanced in favor of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. carriers.'' Northwest is embarking on what it calls its `` most aggressive single-year route expansion'' in the 42 years it has operated in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, launching six new Pacific routes. It was the first to bring the new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 jumbo to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where it was blessed by a Shinto priest. End adv for Sunday, April 30

 The haggard wraith at <LOCATION> Changi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> did n't have to speak. His gray unshaven face and rumpled clothes signaled bad news for my attempt to fly to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> without a confirmed reservation. `` I've been here three days,'' he said as we hung around the transfer desk with dozens of people begging for seats out of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Days later, when I was close to resolving my problem, a <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> agent advised, `` Do n't pay for a ticket unless you get a confirmed reservation.'' But what if plans change? I had a confirmed reservation to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> earlier but stayed in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> a few days longer than expected. Now I was waylaid in an airport with the same name as the famed Japanese POW camp of World War II. My unshaven companion, a West German, said he had suffered a minor injury while vacationing in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. ` I decided it was best to go home right away,'' he said. He reached <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> easily but got stuck trying for a seat to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. What do you do here for three days? `` No clothes, no shave, just wait,'' he said. An hour later came news that I and 27 other standbys would n't be flying to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that night on <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The plane was full, like nine of 11 flights I took in four weeks of travel on Asian airlines starting from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, up and down <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, on to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and back to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Statistics show travel in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> on a steep up curve, and I can vouch for that. Airports were jammed. Tourism in the region may be held back only by a shortage of planes and airport gates. When my <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> landed on the tropical paradise island of <LOCATION> Phuket </LOCATION>, the first big rush was not to the sparkling beaches but to the airport desk to reconfirm your seat out _ essential if you want peace of mind while watching the sunset over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Back to <LOCATION> Changi </LOCATION>. I decided not to be a prisoner of the airport, though I started to wonder when my first five choices of hotel were all full. Finally a room was available and I spent two days exploring <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> before I got a standby seat to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Why are the planes so full? I asked during a visit to a <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> ticket office. `` People want to have a good time now. Now they have money,'' the agent replied, as if tomorrow the bubble would burst.

<HEAD>Minorco Wins A Majority Stake In Gold Fields, Has Another 21 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday enough shareholders have accepted its hostile $ 6 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to give the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African-controlled </LOCATION> bidder a majority stake and another three weeks to proceed with the offer. If it had n't won the majority stake, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer, the equivalent of 3.5 billion pounds, would have expired at 1 p.m. Wednesday. `` We are naturally pleased at the market's judgement and will now consider very carefully what action to take,'' said Chairman Sir <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwardes </PERSON> said. Gold Fields Chairman <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> responded, `` We do n't believe that it is in the interests of Gold Fields and its shareholders for <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> to gain control. We do n't intend to be swayed from our responsibilities by the bully-boy tactics of <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>.'' The takeover of the British gold mining giant would be <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest corporate acquisition ever The battle has been a protracted and expensive one. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, the Luxembourg-based investment arm of the South African Oppenheimer family's gold and diamond mining interests, said it had counted acceptances from holders of 53.21 million Gold Fields shares, representing 24.9 percent of all Gold Fields' stock. Together with the nearly 30 percent already owned by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, the acceptances bring its stake to 54.84 percent, or 117.16 million shares. That means that under British takeover regulations, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> now has 21 days to clear up any other outstanding conditions on the bid. Principal among these is the lifting of a preliminary injunction issued by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court that bars <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from purchasing more than 30 percent of Gold Fields shares. On Monday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court refused to lift the injunction, which arose from an antitrust suit. `` The -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> antitrust -RRB- litigation will proceed to a full trial,'' <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> has twice sweetened its offer since it first launched it in September. It currently is offering half a <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> share and 11.75 pounds in cash for every Gold Fields share. Gold Fields has fought the offer vigorously, offering its shareholders a special dividend if it does n't meet it own earnings targets. It has raised concerns about the concentration of control over the world's gold supplies and potential harmful effects to Gold Fields from being owned by a South African-controlled company. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> is 60 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the Oppenheimers' gold and diamond mining giants.

<HEAD>On Secretary's Day, Xerox Announces Quietest Ribbon Typewriter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chose National Secretary's Day to unveil what it calls the world's quietest ribbon typewriter, a machine nearly as quiet as a computer keyboard. The typewriters introduced Wednesday use a patented technology that gives the printer heads the vibrational characteristics of a hammer weighing nearly 35 pounds, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said. That makes them vibrate at a pitch nearly six octaves lower than usual, almost inaudible to the human ear. The quiet typewriters could help <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> take some business from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the market leader in top-of-the-line typewriters for Fortune 1000 companies, said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, a consultant at <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The big question is whether customers will pay the extra $ 300 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> is asking for the feature, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Polifrone </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Buyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` There's no doubt that the machine is incredibly quiet,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> is the traditional No. 2 in the big-business market, although it fell to third in 1988 because of a big federal government order to an importer of Japanese-made typewriters. The <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> 62 Series typewriters have six patents and five more pending, which should make it impossible for competitors to copy the noise-reducing characteristics, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, the inventor. <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> is the co-inventor of the daisywheel printer system, which was brought to market in 1972 when he was at Diablo Systems. His company was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> a short time later. He is a senior research fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> at a news conference Wednesday demonstrated a 1960s-era <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectric </ORGANIZATION> with a golf ball-type head -LRB- noisy -RRB-, two earlier models of <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> Memorywriters with daisywheels -LRB- quieter -RRB-, and the new 62 Series -LRB- soft clacking -RRB-. Thermal printing typewriters, in which marks are burned onto the page, are even quieter than the new <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> models, but they have drawbacks such as the inability to handle carbons and multi-part forms. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said its research found 65 percent of all secretarial typing involves multi-part forms. The 6225 model is $ 1,995 and the 6240 model, which includes a disk drive for memory storage, is $ 2,595. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said those prices are about $ 300 above corresponding models that are noisier. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said the 62 Series produces 52 decibels at 20 characters per second, which it said is 15 decibels less than other designs. Ms. <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, using different decibel numbers, said the <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> models would displace <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION>'s AP 800 as the quiet champion. The lower vibrational pitch is achieved by rigidly connecting the print tip to several heavy elements inside the typewriter, including a connecting rod and print bail. The greater mass produces a lower tone, much as a thick, long piano wire produces a lower tone than a thin, short one. <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said patent examiners were so incredulous about the achievement that they demanded a demonstration, which <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> and others gave in a hotel conference room in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Koito Questions Pickens' Share Ownership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> demanded Wednesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeover specialist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> disclose whether he is the real owner of the shares he is using to claim management rights as <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder. Three weeks ago, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> bought 20.2 percent of the shares of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>, an auto parts manufacturer closely linked with <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>. In a highly publicized visit to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> last week, he demanded management rights as a shareholder in a direct challenge to deeply entrenched Japanese business convention, which generally abhors anything that smacks of a hostile takeover. In a letter to <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuura </PERSON> said, `` Substantial questions have been raised concerning the nature of <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s ownership of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> shares _ questions which you have pointedly declined to answer in your recent statements to the press.'' <PERSON> Matsuura </PERSON> noted that speculation `` concerning whether <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is in fact the real owner of these shares subject to the full economic risk of its investment.'' In the letter, <PERSON> Matsuura </PERSON> declined to answer <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' earlier written request for three seats on <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors until <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> disclosed whether he had an option, repurchase or security agreement with a Japanese shareholder. The Japanese press has speculated <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> may have an agreement to sell back the block of shares he bought from <PERSON> Kitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Azabu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to bring profits both to himself and the company Such an agreement would allow <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> to use <PERSON> Picken </PERSON>'s internationally known name to up the ante in a greenmail bid against <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 19.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>, the press reports suggested An agreement for <ORGANIZATION> Azabu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> to buy back the shares at a fixed price would protect <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> from a loss. In corporate greenmail, an investor aqcuires a large block of a company's shares, threatening to take it over. The greenmailer then profits when a friendly company saves the target company by buying the shares at a higher price. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> has denied any greenmail effort in the <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> share purchase. Analysts say the negative reaction of the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> markets to <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' action is reflected in the share price of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>, which closed Wednesday at 4,350 yen, or $ 33.21, down from a 5,470 yen high the week before <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' purchase and below the 4,830 yen price shortly after the purchase was announced. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, share prices usually rise when there is a greenmail attempt.

<TEXT>
 The board of <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wattie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had rejected as inadequate a $ 2.4 billion takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION> Ranks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hovis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDougall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The directors said in a statement the bid `` does n't reflect the underlying value of the company.'' They also said a takeover by Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> would result in the loss of effective Australasian control over `` vital elements of the local food industry.'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> Fielder <PERSON> Wattie </PERSON> is the biggest food processor in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The board also called the offer highly conditional, and criticized the fact it is denominated in British pounds and would expose shareholders to exchange-rate movements. The directors also said Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> has not clarified its intentions about possible asset sales and the future of Goodman Fielder <PERSON> Wattie </PERSON>'s 20,000 employees. Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said Wednesday it had raised its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wattie </ORGANIZATION> to 14.9 percent through purchases on stock markets in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The British company's offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wattie </ORGANIZATION> is worth 3.1 million Australian dollars. Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said it would offer stock valued at 3.07 Australian dollars per share for <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION>. The offer is four new Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> shares for every 11 <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> shares and a cash alternative of 2.71 Australian dollars a share on the full bid. Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>' offer was conditioned on it gaining acceptance for at least 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> shares and Australian government approval.

 With his bushy mustache and bell-bottom sideburns, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> looks more like an early -'70s campus radical than a corporate raider who plopped down $ 1.06 billion to muscle a takeover of Singer He surprised Wall Street with hardball tactics that helped him make more than $ 50 million in four failed takeovers before a stunning victory in a battle for the former sewing machine company turned electronics defense contractor. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> now is breaking ground in another way: His trial on securities fraud charges set to start Monday will be the first courtroom test of government efforts to prosecute so-called stock `` parking'' schemes. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, 38, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, is charged with 11 counts of securities and tax fraud, conspiracy and making false disclosures in what the government describes as a two-year lawbreaking spree. His trial at <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court _ the OK Corral for defense lawyers and prosecutors in the more than three-year crackdown on Wall Street crime _ also will test anew the credibility of a key government informant, stockbroker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> has given the government information for several indictments in exchange for leniency in his sentencing on two felonies. He was the main witness in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation case _ which has twice ended in a mistrial, a major setback for the government. ` If they go after a second major case and lose it they've got a real problem,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmid </PERSON>, a securities law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> is accused of conspiring with <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who ran a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> brokerage bearing his name, to violate securities laws in the attempted takeovers of <ORGANIZATION> Cluett </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hammermill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and H.H. <ORGANIZATION> Robertson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and a stock sale in <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1985 and 1986. The deals all included stock arrangements that have been chased by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for years but gained prominence during the scandals that engulfed the business world in the mid-1980s. Stock parking refers to the sale or transfer of securities to conceal true ownership and avoid federal disclosure or tax laws. Under a typical parking arrangement, someone buys stock with the secret understanding that the real owner will repurchase it at a set later date. While parking itself is not defined anywhere as a crime, any `` willful'' violation of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act can be prosecuted criminally. `` I might give -LRB- stock -RRB- to you if I was going to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> for two years and I wanted it safely kept,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities lawyer. `` There's no crime if we're not trying to evade disclosure or tax requirements.'' The parking charges in the <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> case allege the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, investor sought to conceal his level of ownership to mask possible takeover bids. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> laws require public disclosure when 5 percent of a company is acquired. Other cases _ including plea deals made by <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> and imprisoned inside trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> _ have charged violators with temporarily swapping stock for cash to allow them to take positions larger than their capital base would permit. But defense lawyers maintain the government is attempting to criminalize highly technical securities regulations, a tactic one attorney equated with `` trying to shoot a butterly with a cannon.'' They say such violations should be dealt with by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which has the power to levy huge fines and ban broker-dealers from the securities business for life. `` It's against the law but people had never thought of that as something that should be prosecuted as a crime as opposed to something that should be dealt with by regulators,'' said <PERSON> Gandolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities litigator. Added <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s lawyer: `` The government is trying to stretch and make criminal something that has never been prosecuted before criminally.'' Parking activities have been included in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s case against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office indictment of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> as well as the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and Jefferies cases. It will have a high courtroom profile in the <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> case, and the racketeering and fraud cases against defunct <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, which charge overlapping parking schemes. `` The line between civil and criminal law is wavy in this area,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Goldschmid </PERSON>. `` Fundamentally if something nasty is being done in terms of the parking it seems legitimate to criminalize the area,'' he said. `` The problem is that too extensive a use of the criminal law may trivialize enforcement.'' <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s January 1988 takeover of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based Singer is not mentioned in the indictment. He has denied all charges and faces a maximum five years in jail and $ 250,000 fine on each count. Since becoming chairman of Singer, <PERSON> Blizerian </PERSON> has gradually dismantled the defense contractor, selling off its 12 operating units and making an estimated $ 100 million above his acquisition costs.

<HEAD>Bausch &amp; Lomb Changes Length of Wearing Time For Extended Wear Lenses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's leading maker of contact lenses, has decided that it's not a good idea to wear extended-wear soft contact lenses continuously for more than a week without removing and cleaning them. Wednesday's announcement may be the first indication that the end is near for the soft contact lens that can be worn for long periods of time. `` I think you'll see the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> come out with a similar policy very soon,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemp </PERSON>, professor and chairman of the Center for Sight at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Extended-wear lenses, first introduced in 1984, are currently approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for continuous wear of up to 30 days. There are about 4.6 million Americans who wear extended-wear lenses. <PERSON> Lemp </PERSON> said a recent, as yet unpublished, study conducted at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Eye and Ear Infirmary in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, has indicated that the longer lenses are worn continuously, the greater the risk to the eyeball's outer coating, the cornea. `` My own impression, is that people have been shying away from extended-wear lenses for a long time because of safety concerns,'' <PERSON> Lemp </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` This announcement says that seven days is an acceptable time period.'' A spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said the agency was reviewing its policy about extended-wear lenses and would probably issue a statement next week. But <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman in an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> office that is concerned with the safe use of medical devices, said the agency is drafting a letter urging the nation's eight major contact lens makers to voluntarily change their labels and packaging to reflect a seven-day, instead of a 30-day, maximum. The question of the safety of extended-wear lenses has been hotly debated in the eye care industry for the past five years. `` Our review of the research tells us that ... the risk of complication increases at longer-wearing periods,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of the professional products division at <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lomb. The company sent a telegram to 30,000 ophthalmologists and optometrists around the country Monday recommending that extended-wear lenses only be prescribed for seven days' continuous use, rather than 30 days. `` We believe that successful wear is most easily achieved within the seven-day window. We're saying at or before seven days, the lenses should be removed, cleaned and disinfected,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The much-talked about <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> study, which examined both daily-wear and extended-wear soft contact lenses, has been completed, but is being examined by statisticians to ensure accuracy, said <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilfoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman the Eye and Ear Infirmary, a hospital affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Results from the study have been made available to contact lens makers and some eye doctors, but they have not been published and are still being confirmed, she said.

 The stock market drifted in a narrow range today in an inconclusive response to the latest data on the state of the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the nation's gross national product rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year Without the effects of last year's drought, however, the agency said the growth rate would have been just 3 percent. So analysts concluded that the figures provided support for the belief that economic growth lately has been losing momentum as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has sought to restrain inflation. But the inflation figures that accompanied the GNP report were not so encouraging, brokers said, indicating that prices were still rising at a 5 percent to 5.5 percent annual rate.

 About 100 striking <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members were arrested Wednesday and other <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members used their cars to block entrances to a coal preparation plant in the third day of civil disobedience aimed at shutting down <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> operations. The miners were arrested when they tried to block the entrance to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> mine near <LOCATION> Dante </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` We took them away in buses and tried to disembark them for processing at several places in <LOCATION> Dickenson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> but were turned away because of crowd control problems,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. Miners also blocked both entrances to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s Moss No. 3 preparation plant by parking their cars on both sides of the road, leaving space for passenger cars but not coal trucks. State police sealed off the road and called two tow trucks, whose drivers refused to tow away the cars. At least 600 miners have been arrested since the civil disobedience tactics _ largely blocking roads and mine entrances _ went into effect Monday. About 1,700 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members have been on strike at <LOCATION> Pittston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> mines </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> since April 5. The miners had been working without a contract for 14 months, and the union accused <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> of engaging in unfair labor practices during negotiations, a claim <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> denies. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> was joined Monday by 750 <ORGANIZATION> Westmoreland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers the union called off the job for three of the 10 `` memorial days'' _ or personal days _ permitted under their contract. The union also has called selective strikes Monday at three non-Pittston operations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. About 100 miners are striking <ORGANIZATION> Gilbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imported </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardwoods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lynn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Belva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Those also miners had been working without a contract since February 1988. `` We're looking closely at several other independent companies that have also failed to negotiate successor agreements,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> District 17 President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Phalen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phalen </PERSON> refused to say whether there will be additional

 <ORGANIZATION> Transamerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings more than doubled in the first quarter because of a one-time charge that reduced earnings in the year-earlier period, the company said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Transamerica </ORGANIZATION> had first-quarter earnings of $ 70.8 million, or 89 cents a share, compared to $ 30.7 million, or 36 cents per share in the same quarter of 1988, the financial services company said.

However, the company pointed out in a statement that results for 1988 included a $ 36.9 million one-time reduction for `` the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes.'' Operating income for the three months ended March 31 was $ 70.8 million, or 89 cents a share, up 5 percent from $ 67.6 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

 The dollar pushed higher Wednesday against all major currencies in brisk trading after the government released its latest data on economic growth. Gold prices declined. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold at $ 384.50 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 25 cents from late Tuesday. Currency traders said that sentiment toward the dollar remains strong and escalated after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s gross national product report was released. The agency said the economy, as measured by GNP, expanded at a robust annual rate of 5.5 percent the first three months of 1989, the fastest pace in over a year. About half of that increase came from a catch-up from last year's drought. Without the farm sector, the growth rate would have been just 3 percent, down from a 3.5 percent non-farm growth rate in the 1988 fourth quarter. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior trader for <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the currency market interpreted the report as bullish for the dollar, nonetheless, because it meant interest rates probably would remain firm in the near term to combat signs of inflation. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said technical factors and rising oil prices, particularly in wholesale gasoline, also helped push the dollar higher. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose to 131.47 Japanese yen from 131.17 Tuesday. The dollar traded higher in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 132.00 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 132.105 yen, up from 131.475 yen late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6932 late Wednesday, cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late $ 1.7030. Sterling fetched $ 1.6900 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.69945. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's levels, included: 1.8793 West German marks, up from 1.86655; 1.6580 Swiss francs, up from 1.64625; 1.18955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18925; 6.3595 French francs, up from 6.3175; and 1,377.375 Italian lire, up from 1,367.20. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Tuesday's rates included: 1.8770 West German marks, up from 1.8625; 1.6555 Swiss francs, up from 1.6435; 6.3395 French francs, up from 6.3065; 2.1150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1000; 1,374.00 Italian lire, up from 1,366.00; and 1.1900 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1910. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 385.30 a troy ounce from $ 385.70 late Tuesday. The late gold bid in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 384.25 an ounce, down from $ 385.75 late Tuesday. The Zurich late bid was $ 383.50 an ounce, down from $ 385.00. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 384.55 an ounce, down from $ 385.65. Silver prices also lost ground. On the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Comex </LOCATION>, silver bullion for current delivery was bid at $ 5.763 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.789.

 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders on Wednesday soundly rejected a proposal that the company provide humanitarian relief to <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where a 1984 gas leak from a company plant killed more than 3,000 people. `` That should be the last of the direct financial effects of the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> tragedy,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, said after an orderly two-hour meeting. In their first meeting since the company reached a $ 470 million damage settlement with the Indian government in February, shareholders also approved formation of a holding company and establishment of its domestic and plastics business as a wholly-owned subsidiary. But most of the focus Wednesday was on the settlement, which protesters decried as inadequate. The Dec. 2-3, 1984, leak of poisonous methyl isocyanate gas from a Union Carbide chemical plant in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> left an estimated 20,000 people injured, according to government statistics. Activist groups cite figures of 4,000 dead and 200,000 injured. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 14 directed the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company to pay $ 470 million `` in full settlement of all claims, rights and liabilities related to and arising out of the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas disaster.'' Minority shareholders, including church-affiliated groups, had introduced a resolution urging that the company take additional steps to provide immediate humanitarian relief to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but it was rejected by 93 percent of the voting shareholders. Shareholders also rejected a resolution to sell <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s South African holdings <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the company had attempted to provide additional, direct aid to the people of <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, but the government rejected the effort. Protesters, including three <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> victims touring the country to draw support for their cause, said the settlement amount was inadequate. About a dozen protesters displayed banners and distributed information outside before the meeting and several shareholders called for additional company aid during the meeting. `` We are here to tell that this settlement has been rejected by the people of <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Satinath </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarangi </PERSON>, who later was arrested along with three others for trying to enter the Hyatt Regency Hotel and distribute contradictory reports on the accident. `` They do not accept it because they know that this amount is insufficient to meet the health care requirements -LRB- of victims -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Sarangi </PERSON> said. `` To accept such a settlement is to accept certain death, and they are not prepared to accept it.'' The settlement is on appeal and its distribution is being withheld by the government, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the company was securing the protesters' release from jail and was not involved in their arrests. He apologized for the incident and offered to meet with them later. `` The end of litigation does not mean that <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> is forgotten,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Although we have evidence to prove that a <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> employee of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> sabotaged the plant, we know the tragedy will always be linked in people's minds with <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'' The shareholder-approved restructuring, designed for more efficient use of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s multinational operations, creates a subsidiary to be called <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It joins two other core subsidiaries created in January: <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gases </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UCAR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The change was approved by more than 85 percent of the voting shares. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the restructuring would give management at each subsidiary more flexibility and authority to respond to changing markets.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdout in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, may have bowed to political and financial pressure to disinvest its holdings at fire-sale prices after 90 years of doing business in that country, published reports said Wednesday. Business Day of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> quoted banking and other sources as confirming the sale by <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 400 million in assets for $ 150 million to Trek, the largest privately owned oil company in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The local financial daily also said the <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> properties would be sold in separate deals over a period of time. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> representatives in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained silent about the reports. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> at its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters, said Wednesday the company had no comment. `` We'd heard rumors they'd been doing contingency plans for withdrawal,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratcher </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based church group that pressures American companies to leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It sort of flies in the face of everything they've been saying.'' News of the possible sale sent Trek shares soaring 15.3 percent from Monday to Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Trek is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> mining conglomerate. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> employs almost 2,800 people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and has been a symbol of foreign business reluctance to leave the country, despite widespread condemnation of the white-minority government's suppression of the black majority in the system known as apartheid Partly because of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s race policies, more than 170 American companies have withdrawn over the last four years. Most have sold their operations at low prices to South African-controlled business. Since <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil concern, pulled out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> had insisted it would not bow to pressure to disinvest, despite pressure on the company by anti-apartheid groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At least two shareholder resolutions exhorting <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> to vacate <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are on the agenda at the company's annual meeting, scheduled for May 11. The Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the nation's largest daily, reported that `` industry sources confirmed'' <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> was selling its South African assets for an estimated 500 million rand, roughly $ 125 million. The Citizen, another <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> daily, quoted `` local and overseas'' sources as saying that <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> was considering disinvesting. The paper said <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> is the largest non-South African controlled employer in the country with 1,000 gasoline stations, a $ 225 million investment in an oil refinery, and a distribution network.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday granted media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s request to transfer his <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> televison station to a trust to comply with cross-ownership rules. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, in a 3-0 vote, said <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could turn over UHF station <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> owns the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, to trustees <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor. But the commission said that to assure the station was properly `` insulated'' from <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and his affiliate companies, which include the 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> film and TV operations, <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> could not have approval of any possible sale of the station. The commission also said the station could not use programming from the Fox TV network of stations or be an affiliate of that network. The commission said its no communications standard for broadcast trusts `` was well established when Twentieth bought the station -LRB- in 1986 -RRB- and that any communication between the trustees and any Twentieth affiliate, no matter how limited, is prohibitedng contracts expire. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has 60 days to comply. It also could ask the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider, appeal to the courts or ask for a commission hearing on the conditions. Or it could divest the property. Attorneys for <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Under terms of the transfer, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> will relinquish control but still receive profits.

<HEAD>Kahn Sees Pressure to Re-Regulate Airlines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Airport congestion, deteriorating service, rising fares and concern about safety have intensified pressure on the federal government to re-regulate the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline industry, economist <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, widely regarded as the primary architect of the government's October 1987 deregulation of airline fares and routes, also said there could be a partial re-regulation of the industry. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said the public's appraisal of the industry was a `` mixed bag.'' While deregulation has brought cheaper fares and opened air travel to larger numbers of Americans, it also has created congestion and delays, he said. `` Clearly, we have been delinquent in failing to expand supply,'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> told a luncheon organized by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> C.V. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Starr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> More airport capacity and better air traffic control are needed, but deregulation actually has been accompanied by a decline in the number of federal flight inspectors, he said. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said it was difficult to know whether strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> would be able to compete rebuilt as a smaller carrier, as its managers recently proposed. Eastern has been operating a drastically reduced schedule since a March 4 strike by its Machinists, joined by its pilots and flight attendants unions. Several buyout offers have been made but none have been acceptable to parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has indicated it would reorganize the airline into a roughly one-third smaller carrier. `` It is possible for small, compact airlines to find niches,'' he said in response to a question. But he said it was difficult to see what <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s niche could be and how it could compete such against expanding rivals as <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` The race seems to be going to the big airlines,'' said <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike the airlines, other deregulated industries such as telecommunications and financial markets appear unlikely targets of re-regulation, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> suggested. `` I do n't see any possibility of putting the technological genie back in the bottle ... The faith in the market continues unabated,'' he said. However, if there were a deep economic depression, `` all bets are off,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices were mixed in active trading Wednesday with gasoline prices continuing to rise amid uncertainty over summer supplies. Unleaded gasoline for May delivery rose 1.96 cents to finish at 78.12 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Other contract months also gained. Crude oil prices, meanwhile, turned lower after a sharp rally in the previous session. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 22 cents to close at $ 21.19 a barrel. Contracts for delivery through November were down as much as 33 cents. Heating oil contracts also declined, with May down 1.10 cents to 50.98 cents a gallon on the exchange. Analysts said ongoing concern about tight gasoline supplies for summer months helped keep prices firm. The concerns stem partly from reduced refinery capacity, high demand and new federal octane regulations that increase the amount of crude oil needed to make gasoline. A weekly report from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> added more bullish news for the market. The report showed that gasoline inventories fell by more than 2 million barrels in the week ending April 21. The May gasoline contract also got a lift from buyers taking late positions in advance of the contract's expiration on Friday, brokers said. The weekly API report, meanwhile, helped soften crude prices. The report showed that crude stocks rose last week by more than 9 million barrels.

<HEAD>GE Awarded $750 Million Contract From Japanese Utility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been awarded a $ 750 million contract to build a power plant in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that will become the world's largest combined-cycle power plant, the company's top executive announced Wednesday. `` This is the largest fossil generation order ever for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told shareholders during the company's annual stockholders meeting here <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately owned utility, awarded the contract to GE. Once in operation, the combined-cycle power plant will be capable of generating 2,600 megawatts of power _ 600 megawatts more than the world's largest combined-cycle plant currently in operation, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. Combined-cycle power plants use the exhaust heat from a gas turbine to generate steam, which in turn drives a steam turbine, thus generating power from energy that would have been wasted. The power plant is scheduled to begin commercial service in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area in the mid-1990s. All eight of the proposed power plant's gas turbines will be manufactured in <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> plant and the eight steam turbines and hydrogen-cooled generators will be manufactured in <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s facilities in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, N.Y The order from <ORGANIZATION> Toyko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> comes on the heels on a $ 250 million order from <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in March. During the shareholders' meeting, held amid heavy security and marked with often heated exchanges among GE executives and shareholder-activists, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said the company would try to become `` simpler, faster'' and more `` self-confident'' during the 1990s. GE, which employs about 298,000 workers worldwide, reported sales of $ 50 billion in 1988. Profits for the year were $ 3.9 billion, slightly less than the gross national product of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` GE is one of the best corporations to direct the attack on nuclear weapons because it's one of the largest manufacturers of nuclear weapons,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Whistler </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> employee now with an organization called Infact. The Boston-based group initiated a boycott against <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> several years ago and is now promoting a boycott against <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the manufacture of nuclear weapons At the shareholders meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Infact </ORGANIZATION> requested that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors play `` an active role to ensure that the company conduct itself more ethically.'' The group asked <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s board to provide information to the public on <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s activities that `` dramatically impact on our health and lives,'' and participate in public forums to address those issues.

 The government reported Wednesday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy topped the $ 5 trillion mark for the first time last quarter, powered by a strong 5.5 percent growth rate that caused some analysts to express concern about rising inflation. Even discounting for a statistical bounceback from the 1988 drought, a major factor in the overall increase, the gross national product grew at a solid 3 percent annual rate during the January-March period, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. The stock market's response was inconclusive, with stock values drifting in a narrow range. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.20 to 2,3889.11. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villamil </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the economy's performance in the first quarter `` appears to be consistent with moderate, sustainable growth for the balance of the year'' and contains no threat of a recession. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said the growth pattern, in which the pace of consumer spending slowed while exports and business investment rose, was `` a desirable one for the sustainability of the economic expansion.'' Private analysts cautioned, however, that the report offered some troubling indications that inflation was accelerating. A GNP index that measures prices for a fixed marketbasket of goods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the first quarter, up from 4.2 percent during the previous three months. While half of the increase was linked to a pay raise for government employees, `` certainly it suggests we're in a period of accelerating inflation,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the economy's strong growth in the first quarter was `` too much of a good thing.'' `` The report suggested that the economy was still growing at a rate too fast for comfort and the manifestation of this was in the inflation figure,'' <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said. `` No matter what you look at, the inflation worry is there.'' <PERSON> Villamil </PERSON> said that discounting the effects of the pay raise and recent food and energy price increases, the underlying inflation rate seems to be holding `` at a stable lower level of about 4 or 4 -LCB- percent.'' The nation's total output reached an annual rate of $ 5.117 trillion last quarter before adjusting for inflation, the first time it had exceeded $ 5 trillion. After adjusting for price increases, the GNP rose at an annual rate of $ 4.088 trillion last quarter, up $ 54.8 billion from the previous quarter. The 5.5 percent annual rate of growth was the highest since a 6.1 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1987. It reflected an improvement in the trade deficit after two negative quarters, as exports rose 10.6 percent while imports advanced just 2.3 percent, and a strong 9.6 percent increase in business investment. Some signs of a softening in economic growth were evident as well, in a 3.6 percent decline in housing construction and a slim 1.3 percent increase in consumer spending, the slowest growth in a year. The drought-discounted figure for the overall economy _ a growth rate of 3 percent _ was down only slightly from the 3.5 percent pace at which the non-farm economy grew during the final three months of 1988. When the drought's effects are added in, the country's total output of goods and services grew at a 2.4 percent pace during the fourth quarter. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said the spending patterns were of just the right mix to prolong the economic expansion without causing prices to surge. `` Clearly 3 percent economic growth is sustainable and does not add to inflationary pressures,'' he said. While the overall GNP figure for the first quarter was a strong one, a series of government reports that chronicle monthly economic activity suggest that growth began to slow as the three-month period progressed. Most analysts expect the economy to cool further as the year continues in response to a yearlong campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to restrain inflation by driving up interest rates and dampening demand. `` Within the quarter, the economy's growth apparently slowed dramatically,'' <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said. `` Unless the economy begins to get some new fuel in the second quarter, the growth is likely to be a lot slower.'' Some analysts worry that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-inflation campaign may prove so potent that it unintentionally pushes the country into a recession late this year or early in 1989, but others are optimistic the central bank will be able to restrain growth just enough to control prices without halting the expansion. Many analysts expect growth for the year overall to be around 2.7 percent, down significantly from the 3.9 percent recorded in 1988 and also below the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's forecast of 3.2 percent.

<HEAD>Platinum Prices Rise As Confidence In Market Grows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Platinum futures prices surged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday following published reports in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that prices could regain the $ 600 an ounce levels of late 1988. On other markets, gasoline prices rose sharply while crude oil and heating oil prices fell; pork prices rallied but cattle were little changed; grain and soybeans were mixed, and cocoa prices plunged. Platinum settled $ 9 dollars higher across the board, with July at $ 557.30 a troy ounce. Platinum prices were trading near $ 600 an ounce last year, but the market collapsed in mid-December after the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, announced its development of a platinum-free catalytic converter. Platinum is a key component in most of the automobile pollution-control devices, which account for a third of the metal's use worldwide `` A constructive story on platinum in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> saying the market could rise to near $ 600,'' keyed the surge in platinum prices, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Platinum demand is expected to outstrip production into the 1990s, and the market has been rising lately as traders increasingly focus on supply and demand. Gold settled at 40 cents to $ 1 lower, with June at $ 388.20 a troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 3.6 cents lower, with May at $ 5.763 a troy ounce. Gasoline prices soared on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in hectic activity as traders holding contracts for delivery of gasoline in May scrambled to escape that obligation ahead of the contract's expiration this Friday. Crude oil and heating oil prices fell. Crude oil settled 12 cents to 33 cents lower with June at $ 21.19 a barrel; heating oil was 1.09 cents to 1.43 cents lower with May at 50.98 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline oil was .30 cent to 1.96 cents higher with May at 78.12 cents a gallon. Pork futures rallied strongly for a second day on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid speculation that hog marketings will subside in early May. Cattle futures were little changed. Hog slaughters typically slack off and prices typically rise during May in a normal seasonal pattern. But signs of a seasonal decline have not surfaced yet, so the market's recent strength has been almost entirely speculative, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 70.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent lower to .25 cent higher with May at 75.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .45 cent higher with June at 46.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .65 cent to 1.10 cents higher with May at 32.65 cents a pound Soybean futures prices recovered modestly from two days of steep declines on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as traders who sold the market earlier in the week bought contracts to take profits. Corn futures prices increased and wheat futures dropped slightly. Soybean prices rose amid talk that a strike by Brazilian dock workers could continue for some time. `` The strike may provide the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with some export business, although it has n't so far,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 4.11 per bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher, with May at $ 2.65 -RCB- per bushel; oats were 4 \ cents to 5 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.83 \ per bushel; soybeans were 2 \ cents to 8 cents higher with May at $ 7.40 -LCB- Cocoa futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to weakness on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market and to greater availability of cocoa. Cocoa settled $ 22 to $ 45 lower with contract for delivery in May at $ 1275 a metric ton.

Chairman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> said Wednesday that his bank may bid for 20 troubled banks formerly owned by Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, two days after dropping its unsolicited offer for Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference following <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s annual shareholders' meeting, <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> said the company had been invited by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to enter the bidding for the troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks, which were placed in federal receivership last month following heavy real estate and MCorp itself still operates five banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We do n't think we have an edge, but we already have 1,100 people running a bank for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> said. `` We feel we could do the same for some of their other asset problems.'' Just four months ago, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> effectively doubled its size when it was selected by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to acquire the largest bank in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. It renamed the bank <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said acquiring the former <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> banks was one of several possibilities for <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> to expand into new markets in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` There are several markets in which we would like to build on our strength,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> are areas where we'd like to have more strength.'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, a vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> remained `` several weeks away from making a bid'' for the former <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> banks. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s largest bank with more than $ 50 billion in assets. If the deal with Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> had gone through, it would have been the largest bank merger in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and created a bank with more than $ 70 billion in assets. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> launched its $ 2.4 billion stock-swap bid for Citizens and Southern on March 30, but it withdrew the offer Monday after running into a solid wall of resistance from the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> bank's board of directors `` They rejected our offer for reasons I'm sure were entirely clear to them,'' <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> told shareholders, `` although they're not entirely clear to me.''

 Financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Regina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading vacuum cleaner maker, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday The petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws was filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the company said in a statement. <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, which produces vacuum cleaners under such brand names Electrikbroom and Housekeeper, said it anticipates continued business operations during the pending bankruptcy case. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, said the company's primary secured lenders have agreed to interim financing as a debtor-in-possession, subject to court approval Analysts have said <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>'s problems have been linked partly to the quality of its Housekeeper line of vacuum cleaners, introduced about three years ago. Two former top officers of <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> are scheduled to be sentenced in federal court Friday on charges that concerned a $ 100 million loss for investors. Former Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheelen </PERSON> and former Chief Financial Officer <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> admitted to falsifying company records to mislead stockholders and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and to keep stock prices up. <PERSON> Sheelen </PERSON> owns more than one-third of the company's 9.1 million outstanding shares. He admitted telling Golden to falsify sales by not subtracting returned appliances from the company's sales figures. They also admitted to inflating company income by $ 15 million to $ 27 million by using falsely reduced cost figures and false invoices, and reported inflated per-share earnings. In September, when the executives resigned, <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> withdrew its financial statements showing a $ 10.9 million profit for the year ended June 30, 1988, on sales of $ 181.1 million, calling them inaccurate. Its share price, as high as $ 27 in August, plunged to $ 3.75 in October and down to 36 cents a share in January. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>'s stock was removed from the NASDAQ over-the-counter trading system.

 Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> overrode objections from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and voted Wednesday to force the troubled savings and loan indusry to subsidize home buying by poor people. With four Democrats joining 20 Republicans in opposition, the panel voted 27-24 to require the 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> to set aside 5 percent of their profits to provide low-interest loans for housing the working poor. The amendment, sponsored by the committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, would provide about $ 75 million a year for four years and more per year after that. Consumer groups said that's enough to give 500,000 home buyers a 2 percentage point break on their mortgages. The regional banks, although created by the federal government, are owned by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry and pass their profits on to individual S & amp; Ls. Republicans argued that the regional banks are already being tapped to pay for part of the industry's bailout and that further demands will only hurt the chances for restoring the ailing industry to health. `` To play social games with this legislation at this point in time, I think, would jeopardize confidence in the system,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. Democrats, however, said the <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> amendment amounted to a modest subsidy to the poor in a bill that was providing more than $ 100 billion to protect <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L depositors and said without it there was little reason for a separate savings industry. `` If we do n't subsidize low-income housing, they're going to be the only people who do n't get subsidized in this bill,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. The four Democrats siding with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> were Reps. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Earlier, committee members prayed for God's help to rise above narrow self-interest and then began exempting individual institutions from reform provisions of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan. The panel started what is expected to be at least two days of work on the S & amp; L bill by exempting an institution in <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' district from provisions that would make each bank or S & amp; L in a holding company liable when another commonly controlled institution fails The amendment, passed by 37-11 vote, is designed to help only the <ORGANIZATION> Frost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. In a subsequent 44-2 vote, the panel adopted an amendment by Reps. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>, D-Del., and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, that carves out another exception for <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> By voice vote, lawmakers exempted two institutions in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> from the provision at the request of Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON>, D-Neb. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to broaden the financial responsibility of holding companies in bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L failures as a way of limiting losses to the government insurance fund and to taxpayers. The 51-member committee had begun the session with bowed heads as <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s non-voting delegate and a Baptist minister, prayed, `` Help each of us to rise above our own narrow self-interest.'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, a Democrat, said that in 19 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had never felt compelled to begin a committee session with prayer, but was moved to offer one because of the extraordinary importance and expense of the savings and loan legislation, described as the biggest taxpayer bailout ever. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bill, which passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week, provides at least $ 157 billion over 10 years, the bulk of it from taxpayers, to pay for closing or merging more than 500 failed thrift institutions. It also contains a number of reforms designed to prevent the problem from recurring, chief amog them a requirement that S & amp; L owners back their lending with more of their own capital. Some of the committee members objecting to the exemption for the bank in <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' district, including <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, are opposing the chairman's effort to stiffen capital requirements as passed earlier this month by <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>'s Subcommittee on Financial Institutions The subcommittee version would require S & amp; L owners to risk $ 1.50 in `` real money'' or `` tangible'' capital for every $ 100 in lending, the same standard adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, with an amendment that his opponents privately conceded was likely to pass, would boost that to $ 2.25. He is supported by Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the panel's senior Republican. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> argued that overly tough capital rules would force hundreds of otherwise healthy institutions out of business. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, repeated his threat to recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto any bill with weak capital standards. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is seeking a 3 percent minimum for tangible capital, but said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s 2.25 percent standard `` shows a marked and welcomed improvment.'' In an attachment to his letter, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> promised, `` Thrifts with low capital and a reasonable chance of survival will not be summarily liquidated.'' However, he said they `` should not be allowed to grow and should be under the supervision of the regulator.'' On another matter, the committee voted 32-10 to adopt an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., aimed at prohibiting banks from running advertisements disparaging the condition of the S & amp; L deposit insurance funds Backers argued that such ads needlessly cause drains from <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls since both banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls are backed by the federal government. Opponents said the amendment violated constitutional guarantees of free speech.

 <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would accelerate a planned restructuring, laying off employees faster and cutting the pay of its top executives as it struggles to return to profitability. The Lowell-based computer maker announced earlier this month that it would trim its work force from 30,200 to 28,500 or less by June 1990. The company said Wednesday it would reach that goal nine months earlier, by Sept. 1989. The company also announced 20 percent pay cuts for <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, its chairman and chief executive, and his son <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, its president and chief operating officer. Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> H.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> is also to take a 10 percent pay cut, and all executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents will take 5 percent cuts. The company said the reductions took effect immediately and would be lifted when the company returns to profitability. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> reported last week that it had a $ 55 million pre-tax loss in its third quarter, the second-largest ever, after a $ 78.6 million loss in December 1987. Founded in 1951, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> ranks 145th on Fortune magazine's list of the 500 largest American companies with revenues of $ 3.07 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1988. After building its reputation on office word processors in the 1970s, the company faltered in recent years as sales of its mid-range computer systems have been eaten away by powerful personal computers and workstations. In addition, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> has suffered from heavy discounting of its mainstay VS line of minicomputers and competition from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s AS400 minicomputer. In an effort to revive the company's fortunes, founder <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> has begun to take a more active role in day-to-day operations. The company also has moved to cut costs and revise its product lines. Over the last three months, it has cut its work force by 880, mainly through attrition. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> is now betting heavily on the success of its Freestyle personal computing and imaging system, introduced in November, which allows computer-shy office workers to alter electronic documents with their voices and handwriting, as well as with a keyboard.

 <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> renewed its resistence to a $ 1.15 billion takeover bid Wednesday and told shareholders an overall refinancing of the company is being considered. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> has opposed a takeover by rival poultry processor <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> since October. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> shareholders voted last week to reject a management-backed move to merge their company with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. In a statement announcing a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> managers said a `` leveraged recapitalization'' is under consideration. Such a refinancing would involve mortgaging company assets to pay dividends to stockholders, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` It would just get some current value out to our shareholders. It does n't have anything to do with blocking <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said he did not know how many company assets or which ones might be mortgaged. <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Overton </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keegan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> is in good financial shape and the recapitalization could be a way to keep shareholders loyal to <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> managers. `` Holly Farms management believes that a leveraged recapitalization is now a viable alternative to either a merger with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> or an acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Overton </PERSON> said. The recapitalization would greatly increase <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' debt, he said. A debt increase often is used as a tool to fight off an unwanted suitor. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> managers should consider their shareholders' vote on the <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> deal as a call to sell to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. `` It looks to me a little like they're in the process again of telling their shareholders what's best for them rather than listening to their shareholders,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. Tyson is offering <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> stockholders $ 63.50 a share in cash, while the proposed merger with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> was worth about $ 60 a share in a stock swap. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> stock closed Wednesday at $ 60.75 a share, down 25 cents, in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading.

 Oil mogul <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on Wednesday began his proxy campaign to unseat the board of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, mailing letters seeking shareholder support for replacing the board with nominees who would sell the airline company to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` We believe that a failure to elect our nominees will give the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board an excuse to continue to pursue alternatives which do not result in a prompt sale of the company,'' the letters read. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, parent of Eagan-based <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, has rejected <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 90 a share tender offer valued at $ 2.7 billion but has pledged to explore alternatives to maximize shareholder value. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who owns about 2.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 29.1 million shares, wrote in his letter that he is skeptical of the claim. He cited the company's refusal to withdraw its `` poison pill'' takeover defense plan and a requirement that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> suitors sign a restrictive confidentiality agreement. `` Ask yourself whether <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> is truly seeking the best price for you when they insist that we, the only announced bidder, sign an agreement calling for us to consent to a standstill, abandon this proxy contest, abandon our tender offer and abide by whatever course or alternative the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board unilaterally approves,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> wrote. Northwest closed down 25 cents at $ 100 a share Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Eleven board members are up for election at <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting May 15. A group of dissident shareholders are attempting to change the record date for the vote, which now is limited to shareholders of record as of March 17. Hennepin County District Judge <PERSON> Delila </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said Wednesday that the request deserves a hearing next week and denied a request by <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to refuse the change. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cambronne </PERSON>, an attorney for the shareholders, said more than 65 percent of <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> stock has changed hands since March 17. <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said new owners of <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> stock probably are takeover speculators and would be more likely to vote for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' slate of nominees. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> also asked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to suspend the rest of the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> shareholders' lawsuit, saying jurisdiction in shareholder matters belongs in the courts of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> took that request under advisement without saying when she would rule. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s poison pill would prevent <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' proposed board from selling the company for six months after getting control. A <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge on Tuesday denied <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> request to invalidate the provision. Also Wednesday, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Commercer Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> must make supplemental disclosures to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> shareholders by 2 p.m. CDT Thursday to explain how he would operate the airline in light of the large amount of money he proposes to borrow to complete the purchase. If the `` objective facts'' are not supplied by the deadline, the tender offer in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> will be suspended, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. But the commissioner also left open the possibility of another hearing on the matter for Thursday night if <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> requests it. There was no immediate comment from <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said his spokeswoman, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 About 7 percent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> gas supplies were halted following the shutdown Wednesday night of the onshore <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fergus </ORGANIZATION> gas terminal operated jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION> oil companies, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said. The terminal near this east Scottish oil port city handles gas from 16 production platforms in the British sector of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil and gas field. It was shut down after routine inspection revealed defects in equipment that `` could be of a serious nature,'' <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> initially reported that the shutdown involved the whole of the terminal, which a spokesman for the Scottish sector of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said handled about a third of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> gas supplies. British Gas is the monopoly company responsible for gas supplies to homes and industry throughout <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman subsequently said that only part of the terminal had been shut and that this part accounted for about 7 percent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> gas supplies. The shutdown is the second <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> setback in eight days. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>'s Brent oil field has been shut since April 18 when a gas leak and explosion on <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s Cormorant Alpha platform halted production of 472,000 barrels of oil a day, or nearly a quarter of the British sector's oil production.

Chancellor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> rejected <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' request for an injunction that would have barred <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from issuing `` poison pill'' stock rights to shareholders before <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting May 15. A poison pill makes it more difficult and costly for a group to take over a company. The stock-rights plan include a provision that bars any newly elected <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board from dropping the poison pill until 180 days after the board is in place. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the plan would put him at a competitive disadvantage in his bid to take over the nation's fourth-largest air carrier because it would effectively block a new board of directors from selling Northwest for 180 days. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> argued Monday that the prospect of a long delay would discourage shareholders from supporting <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in the proxy fight <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> planned at <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' attorneys did not argue against the poison pill, saying they would favor such a plan if <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' group gained control of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. But they challenged the 180-day umbrella. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> wrote that he was `` rather unimpressed'' by <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' argument that the delay in canceling the poison pill `` will be a material factor to those <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders who might otherwise -LRB- be -RRB- for the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> slate.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to notify shareholders that his ruling is not a final decision on the validity of the delayed redemption provision, however. He said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> may return 45 days after <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting to seek a ruling on the plan's validity In a statement, a <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> spokeman said: `` While we would, of course, have preferred that the court grant the relief specifically requested in our motion, we are most gratified that its is requiring <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, as a condition to the issuance of the rights, to give stockholders notice that the provision may be invalidated and that the court is committed to deciding the merits of the issue soon after the annual meeting.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he had just received the ruling and could not comment on it in detail. `` It's fair to say we're pleased with it,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board of directors on Monday unanimously rejected <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 2.7 billion, $ 90-a-share bid, alleging that the offer is unfinanced and in part illegal under securities laws But the board said it is willing to negotiate with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and other qualified bidders. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed at $ 100.50 Tuesday, down $ 2.25, on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> has threatened to suspend <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s registration statement in which <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> offers to purchase all of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said Monday the statement is deficient in several areas. At a hearing Tuesday night, lawyers for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> reacted coolly to <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s request that they submit more information about <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' bid. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandeman </PERSON> said after the hearing that he would try to convince <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> that the disclosures already made of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' financial plan are adequate. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> requested that more information be submitted by noon Wednesday. If he decides that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has not made a sufficient explanation of his plans, he can order that the offer be suspended in the state. In a development Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board decided, at least temporarily, against a planned $ 1.6 billion order for new planes. Instead, it authorized its plane-leasing subsidiary to buy 10 used DC-10s and 14 used DC-9s to lease to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and other carriers.
