 A Greyhound bus driving through a spring snowstorm overturned and slid down an embankment, injuring 16 people, and in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> snow fell Sunday for the first time in May in nearly a century. Snow also fell in parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, 10.1 inches of snow fell, breaking that city's snowfall record for May by more than 6 -LCB- inches. The unusual spring storm dumped up to 2 inches of icy slush on this northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city, and was blamed for the bus accident Saturday that left three people hospitalized Sunday. Thirteen other people, including driver <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were treated at two hospitals for minor cuts and bruises and released, said Highway Patrol Sgt. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. Rains and light snow abruptly changed to a heavy mix of snow and sleet and quickly covered <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Route 2 along <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> just west of <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> when the accident occurred around 8:30 p.m. Saturday, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. `` I've never seen anything like -LRB- the weather -RRB- last night in May,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. `` It was an isolated condition, a snow and sleet downpour. Within a matter of seconds, it seemed like you had two inches of slush on the road.'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was trying slow the bus by downshifting when it spun 180 degrees in the road, flipped onto its left side and slid gently down the 20-foot road embankment, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, overnight temperatures dipped into the low to mid-30s. Snow Saturday and Sunday came exactly 91 years after the city recorded its last measurable snowfall in May.

 The leader of a drug-smuggling cult that killed 15 people and buried their bodies along the U.S.-Mexican border ordered his own killing when police closed in on him, two of his companions said Sunday. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> was shot and killed Saturday after police appeared outside the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment building where he was staying with <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and five other alleged cult members. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, 24, a former honor student at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southmost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, told reporters <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> to kill him and his right-hand man, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, described as the `` witch'' of the cult, de <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> and three others arrested after the shootout were presented to reporters Sunday at the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> City Attorney General's office. They stood behind a 3-by-6-foot table bearing confiscated cult items, including a skull apparently made of wax and a female doll holding another doll. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said he shot <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> with a machine gun after <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> ordered him to do so and hit him when he resisted. `` He went crazy, crazy'' when police came, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, who had had collar-length blond hair and a beard and wore a dirty white shirt. `` He grabbed a bundle of money and threw it and began shooting out the window,'' he said. `` He said everything, everything was lost.'' He quoted <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> as saying, `` No one's going to have this money.'' Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> `` ordered him to kill him because it was the end and he wanted to die with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>.'' She referred to <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, as <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padrino </LOCATION>, or the godfather. The bodies of <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> were found slumped together inside a tiny closet in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment. Their shirts were smeared with blood. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said she did not see the shooting or the killings of 15 people whose bodies were found on the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border in April. She said she did not know about those killings until she saw reports of them on television. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> are believed to have directed human sacrifices, mutilations and the boiling of brains and other organs in rituals to bring occult protection to their drug-smuggling ring. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, 22, said he took part in the killing of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> college student, and of some of the others on the ranch. But he and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> indicated <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> committed most of the killings. Asked who killed <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said: `` Adolfo.'' De <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said the young American was killed with a machete chop to the head. His back was opened to remove his spinal column for a necklace, he said. Appearing calm, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said she was sorry about the death of <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> and the others. `` I feel sorry because when he disappeared I was trying to help the -LRB- <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> -RRB- family,'' she said in response to reporters' questions She did not explain what she meant. `` If I had known it was like this, I would n't have been in it,'' she said of the cult. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> told authorities <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> invited her to join `` Christian Santeria'' and asked her to use voodoo to help people with problems, said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> <PERSON> Uscanga </PERSON>, deputy city attorney general. She said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> initiated her into the cult in 1988. Santeria is a blend of Catholicism and old African beliefs that includes animal sacrifices. Asked if she was in love with <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said, `` No, but I followed him.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> while working as a laborer on a northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> ranch. He said he was `` marked'' for divine protection in January at a ceremony in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because he had killed someone in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. Pulling back his shirt, he showed reporters a design of arrows on each upper arm. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, missing since the first 12 bodies were uncovered on the ranch April 11, were among 11 people indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a four-count drug indictment. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, de <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> and the others were being held in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on charges including homicide, criminal association, wounding a police agent in the arrest, and damage to property, <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> said. Also arrested Saturday were <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who told authorites she loaned <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> $ 2,000; <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Orea </PERSON>, 23, a journalism student at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Guero </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 29. The connection of the latter two was not immediately clear. De <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said two others involved in the cult were fugitives.

<TEXT>
 Industrial designer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, whose eye for color helped transform this city's Art Deco District into a rainbow of pastel colors and renovated beachfront hotels, died of complications from AIDS. He was 43. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who died Friday, saw the potential of buildings that had weathered through the years when few others could. Up to 150 Art Deco buildings in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> are painted pink, purple, peach and periwinkle, and about half are <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>' designs. He founded the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitman </PERSON> in 1976. `` Really, he taught me what I know about Art Deco,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Capitman </PERSON>. In 1980, much of the Art Deco District's buildings displayed weathered, cracked stucco. But <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> could see past the peeling paint, and came up with a scheme for a whole block of buildings that made them look like confections. The idea caught on. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and grew up with visions of the Art Deco-style Radio City Music Hall. He started a design firm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but moved to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. He continued doing interior design as well as the <LOCATION> Deco </LOCATION> district's colorful exteriors It was not immediately known if <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> left survivors. Plans for a memorial service were pending.

 Chemical fumes sparked an explosion in a barge docked for cleaning at this <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town Saturday, igniting a fire that injured two men and left one missing. The barge was empty but apparently contained residues from its usual cargo of benzene, a flammable chemical solvent, police said. Residents within a half-mile of the 3:30 p.m. blaze were asked to close their windows late Saturday afternoon and evening to avoid breathing possibly hazardous fumes, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> police Officer <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Benzene may produce irritating or toxic gases when burned. Vapors from the chemical also can cause coughing and lung irritation, as well as dizziness. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the barge had been docked between the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and some railroad tracks for cleaning. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> is in eastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` They were cleaning the barge,'' he said. `` It was empty and fumes apparently ignited.'' The blaze was extinguished by the town's Fire Department about two hours after it began, he said. Firefighters remained at the scene Saturday evening, wetting down ashes. Rescue crews planned to drag the 40-foot-deep river Sunday in search of the missing man, who disappeared when the blast blew the hatch off the vessel, said city police Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyder </PERSON>. The two injured men were taken to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where one, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Newbrough </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was listed in serious condition with burns, a concussion and fractures, said a nursing supervisor who refused to identify herself. The other victim, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, also suffered burns but refused treatment and left the hospital, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Hyder </ORGANIZATION> said the three men were on the barge looking down into the hatch when it exploded. None of the chemical spilled into the river, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

 A barge carrying over 2 million gallons of gasoline struck a buoy Saturday and spilled about 80,000 gallons into the rain-swollen <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, environmental officials said. The leak aboard the <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> 45 was stopped and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials were investigating the cause of the accident, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> said. The accident about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> was reported about 4 a.m., said <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> regional director <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Magee </PERSON>. The barge continued upriver to <LOCATION> Ravena </LOCATION> after the accident, where workers pumped out some compartments of the craft and shifted gasoline to other parts of the barge, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> owns the gasoline, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Once the gasoline was shifted, <PERSON> Magee </PERSON> said, the barge was to continue on to <LOCATION> Rensselaer </LOCATION> and unload, then return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for repairs. Rain and wind broke up most of the gasoline by Saturday afternoon, she said. A contractor was hired to clean up the rest of the spill, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` We're expecting it will have a minimum impact and are arranging to get some biologists on the river,'' <PERSON> Magee </PERSON> said.

 Only about 50 leather-clad motorcyclists and a few hundred other peaceable partyers zipped into Zap on Saturday for the anniversary of the `` Zip to Zap'' party that ended in a riot 20 years ago. `` That makes my day. I love people and I love things happening. We do have it in order, so I am not worried,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sailer </PERSON> said, smiling and waving beneath his blue baseball cap, which was emblazoned with the slogan `` I Zipped To Zap And Had A Blast.'' `` This is n't anything like it was 20 years ago,'' said <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, who was among the police who tried to quell the original riot. `` It was a long evening then.'' <PERSON> Sailer </PERSON> had been told to expect 500 bikers for Zip To Zap II, which was originally planned as 12 hours of partying and rock music in one of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s smaller towns. In 1969, this quiet hamlet of 300 people about 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> hosted the first Zip to Zap, an idea hatched by the editor of the student newspaper at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. It ended in disaster. The National Guard was called in to chase 2,000 drunken revelers out of town. Celebrants set a bonfire in Main Street and caused about $ 3,000 in damage before the crowd was dispersed. Saturday's reunion started quietly but livened up as the sun went down. People began dancing in the street to the blare of recorded music, and Zap's two bars were jammed. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said the crowd swelled to more than 500 people. Thirty people had been arrested by late Saturday night, mostly for being too young to drink or for drinking on public property. Middle-aged people and more than a few locals mingled with the student crowd. The mood was festive, far from a mob scene. There were guest books for people to sign. Soda pop and hot dogs were for sale everywhere, although beer was banned in the streets. D.J. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> of <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, who attended the first Zip to Zap in 1969, remembered that beer prices helped touch off the riot. `` It was a mass of humanity out on the streets and everybody was having a good time, a good time gone sour,'' he said. `` Townspeople started jacking up the prices on beer and food and everything and kids got upset. They doubled the price on six-packs of beer.'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, 53, brought his wife and two children to Zap for the reunion. `` They wanted to zip to Zap, so I said OK,'' he said <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> was also making amends for what happened in 1969. `` I apologized to the people here for what happened. The National Guard ... had to save the town. There would have been nothing left here.'' <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> transformed her garage just off Main Street into a mini-cafe, complete with $ 9 souvenir T-shirts: `` Zip To Zap. We're Back. The reunion was a good idea, the 64-year-old woman said. `` You have to let the kids do something, and the older people are just as nosy.'' Her son called her from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Friday night, asking if she was ready for the `` zippers'' and envious that he could not be home, Mrs. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` If everything is kept under control, it would be nice to be an annual event,'' she said. But the denizens of Zap are far from agreement on that idea. Some wanted the town barricaded Saturday to keep the visitors out, she said. `` It's a touchy question,'' she said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were brothers in communism, but the first summit since they fell out nearly 30 years ago will not be a family reunion. The Chinese, determined to show independence from their one-time tutor in revolution, have forced the Soviets to make the overtures and concessions toward normal relations. When <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> comes to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 15, it will be <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the 84-year-old Chinese leader, who plays big brother, because of both age and his pioneering of economic reforms the Soviets are just beginning. During the past year, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pulled Soviet troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, announced unilateral troop withdrawals from the Chinese border and put pressure on the Soviet ally <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after more than a decade of occupation. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will do so by Sept. 30. Those actions met <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s three conditions for a summit with the Soviet leader and moved closer to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own goal of reducing international tension so he can focus on domestic economic problems. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> agreed to the summit almost grudgingly. When <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister, announced the date during a visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in February, the Chinese initially denied it and then issued a confirmation two days later. Ties between the two nations in trade, foreign policy and cultural exchange were close between 1950 and 1960, but <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leaders say they have no intention of resuming the alliance. The main immediate value of the summit for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which is wary of an expansionist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, has been the concessions on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources said the Chinese were trying to extract new pledges even in the final weeks before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arrival. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal plan does not include a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force or establishment of an interim government to oversee elections. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is said to want both endorsed in the summit communique. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seeks a general statement of principles guiding the relationship, like the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Communique signed by President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on his 1972 visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` It's not obligatory'' to mention <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in the communique, said V.V. <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON>, cultural counsellor at the Soviet Embassy. `` This document is designed for many years, and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is a problem of this year and next year.'' <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON>, Soviet deputy foreign minister, slipped into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> quietly in late April, hoping to resolve the matter. A Western diplomat described it as a `` game of chicken.'' Animosity and disagreement between the two countries have a long history. From the 17th century to the early 20th, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> contended for influence in the vast Asian interior. Soviet agents helped organize the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1921 and gave it assistance, but also tried to dictate strategy in a way that irked the revolutionaries, especially <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> thought little of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s plan for revolution in the countryside. The Soviet dictator continued recognizing the Nationalist Chinese government even as <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s peasant guerrilla army was sweeping to victory. Friction continued after the Stalin-Mao alliance of 1950. The Soviets insisted on special rights to ports and railways in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in return for military and technological aid, embarrassing Chinese leaders who claimed to have ended foreign control. The split came in the early 1960s, after the Soviets refused to back <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in its 1959 border conflict with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, would not help recapture <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from the Nationalists and scrubbed an agreement to help the Chinese build a nuclear bomb. A border dispute led to a brief but bloody clash in 1969. Pragmatism took precedence over ideology under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> resumed trade and other non-political exchanges with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> like to be seen as international peacemakers, and both have serious economic and political problems at home. Restless nationalist groups in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been demanding autonomy or independence. University students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have demonstrated for democracy on an unprecedented scale. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> already has done away with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s communes and shelved his theories of continuous class struggle. By meeting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is addressing one of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s last remaining legacies: the Chinese-Soviet estrangement that has affected the world political map for three decades.

 Two bombs exploded near <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> patrols overnight, injuring nine soldiers, police said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the first attack, saying it marked Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 10 years in power. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the other explosion. In the first bombing, police said the soldiers were in a mobile patrol at <LOCATION> Moybane </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Crossmaglen </LOCATION>, close to the south <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on Saturday night when the bomb exploded in an abandoned house. They said one of the five men was seriously hurt by being hurled through the air with flying debris, and the house was wrecked. The five soldiers were airlifted by helicopter to a hospital, and the area was sealed off to await inspection by daylight in case of booby traps, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it carried out the bombing to mark Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 10th year in power. On the actual anniversary on Thursday it said it set off a roadside bomb that day in <LOCATION> Silverbridge </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Crossmaglen </LOCATION> that kiled one soldier and wounded three others. The second bomb exploded several hours later on Sunday, 12 miles away at <LOCATION> Camlough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>, as another mobile patrol was passing.

 The mayors of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> easily won re-election Saturday, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>'s former mayor regained her office by a commanding margin in elections in four <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities. The least predictable contest all day was in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, where two <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members in the six-candidate field will face each other in a runoff election. The campaigns in all four cities failed to inspire much voter interest. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, with all 299 precincts reporting, Mayor <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> had 60,895 votes, or 73 percent, to 17,002, or 20 percent, for attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> had 3,510 ballots, or 4 percent, and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON> had 2,658, or 3 percent. Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, backed by a huge campaign fund and polls showing widespread support, had been expected to win a second two-year term in the nation's seventh-largest city. Her main opponent had been Lesser, who picked up some support from some minority groups that once backed the incumbent. City Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said he expected 15 percent or less of the city's nearly 500,000 registered voters to cast ballots. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, former Mayor <PERSON> Lila </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON> won by 45,300 votes, or 59 percent, to 24,107, or 31 percent for insurance executive <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauthe </PERSON>. They were trailed by five other candidates who had no more than 2 percent of the vote each. Ms. <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON>, who was mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> from 1975 to 1981, was supported by the man who replaced her, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, a leading Hispanic political figure. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, beset by personal problems, decided against running for a fifth term. <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Elections Administrator <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> predicted an 18 percent voter turnout. Fort Worth Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON>, who faced no serious opposition in his bid for a fourth two-year term, won with 14,292 votes, or 89 percent. He was trailed by <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who had 1,099 votes, or 7 percent, and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, with 656 votes, or 4 percent. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, with all ballots counted, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Suzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> had 16,220 votes, or 31 percent, to 11,930 votes, or 23 percent for Mayor Pro Tem <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>. The other four candidates did not receive significant votes. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> will face off May 27. Mayor <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was prevented by law from seeking a fifth, two-year term.

 The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> ballot was the first one in 14 years that did n't include <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> He was a city councilman for six years before becoming mayor in 1981. Beset by a troubled marriage and his son's ill health, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> last fall said he would n't run again and accepted a job in the private sector. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> briefly reconsidered his re-election decision in January after <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> voters approved a transportation tax to pay for a domed stadium that he supported. But he decided against running after Ms. <PERSON> Cockrell </PERSON>'s supporters said they would stay behind her. In the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> race, Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, 65, raised $ 300,000 compared with Lesser's $ 16,000. But she spent more than $ 1 million to be elected two years ago, when neither was an incumbent. `` It certainly is a different campaign,'' said <PERSON> Lorlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartos </PERSON>, a campaign consultant for Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. `` The races are much less expensive throughout the city. It's a different economy.'' The shooting deaths of five <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officers in 1988 clouded Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' first term. Police blamed city leaders for not providing enough support to the force, which was also beset by a congressional investigation into its officers' use of deadly force. Minority leaders insist on increased citizens review of police. A non-partisan committee appointed by Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> studied the city's racial problems and this spring recommended redistricting the City Council. There have never been more than three minority members on the 11-member council, though the 1990 census is expected to show that minorities make up more than half the city population. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> have city manager governments in which the mayor plays a lesser, often ceremonial role. The <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> mayor has more power because there is not a city manager.

 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> ended his five-nation Southeast Asian tour Sunday and headed back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to annoint a successor and restore his party's scandal-ridden image <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in a report from the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> capital, said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> hinted he would ask veteran politician <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> to accept the premiership despite his reluctance to take the post. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and other senior Filipino officials were on hand for a 10-minute farewell ceremony at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport, where <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> received a 19-gun salute before boarding the plane for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. There were no speeches. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> went ahead with the visit despite his announcement April 25 that he would resign to take responsibility for a scandal in which the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is accused of seeking to buy influence with political donations or stock transactions that yielded huge profits to politicians, bureaucrats and others. On Monday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is expected to meet with <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, a former foreign minister. Japanese sources say <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> is expected eventually to accept the appointment if certain conditions are met, though these are unclear. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> hinted to Japanese reporters traveling with with him that he would ask <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> to take the job. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> stopped short of mentioning <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> by name but said `` it is quite natural for a respectable man to win the heart of the people.'' The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has focused on <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> as a successor because so many of the party's leaders are tainted by Recruit donations or stock deals, while <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> as seen as basically clean. But the 75-year-old <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, chairman of the party's policy-making Executive Council, has cited his age and heart problems caused by diabetes as reasons for declining the nomination to be party president and thus prime minister. During his trip, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also visited <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. All five countries he toured are members of the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the major regional trading bloc.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> oil refinery, once the world's largest, resumed exports Saturday after an eight-year gap, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said a 10,000-ton shipment of fuel oil from the refinery left <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahshahr </PERSON> port, but did not say where it was headed. The refinery, located only a few miles from the border with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, shut down soon after the Iran-Iraq war broke out in September 1980. The 3,200-acre complex was heavily shelled by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> artillery during the war. More than 150 personnel were killed and lost production was estimated at $ 9 billion. Around 6,000 technicians and specialists started round-the-clock repair work immediately after a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire halted the gulf war Aug. 20. Production resumed April 1 with an initial capacity of 130,000 barrels a day of oil products, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. Capacity is expected to rise later this year and reach 360,000 barrels a day in the next two to three years. Before the war, the refinery produced 650,000 barrels a day. Following repairs of war damage at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s six other refineries, the country's total refinery capacity is currently estimated at 850,000 barrels a day.

 A newspaper reported Sunday that the British government will refuse to negotiate with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on reducing short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> even if the other 15 members of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agree to do so. The Sunday Telegraph, in a Washington-dated story, said Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> made her views known to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in diplomatic notes and telephone conversations last week. `` Her tough stance on the issue is proving the main obstacle in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's frantic search for a compromise after <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s insistence that negotiations must take place as soon as possible,'' the newspaper reported.

 The ringleader of a drug-smuggling cult that killed 15 people was slain in a gunbattle with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police Saturday, and his girlfriend, the alleged `` high priestess,'' was captured, police said. <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators Saturday night that cult leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, was killed and that police have arrested <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, a 24-year-old former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> college student described as the `` witch'' of the cult. The government-run <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported early Sunday that unidentified officials in the attorney general's office had confirmed the killing and the arrest. Alleged cult member <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> also was killed in the shootout at a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> residence about 4:30 p.m., said <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Three other people believed to be cult members were also arrested. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, the alleged `` godfather,'' and <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> had been sought in an international manhunt and are believed to have masterminded the activities of the cult that killed 15 people in a series of ritualistic sacrifices and drug-related slayings. <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said he spoke on the telephone with Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, who is in police custody in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, for about five minutes Saturday night, but he would not divulge details of the conversation. The attorney general's office in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Federal District would not immediately confirm the story, but said he would discuss the details at a news conference Sunday. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, 24, had been charged with aggravated kidnapping by <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities and are believed to have directed human sacrifices, mutilations and the boiling of brains and other organs in rituals to bring occult protection for their drug-smuggling ring. The ring and its macabre activities was discovered when authorities unearthed 15 bodies buried west of the border city of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, beginning on April 11. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, missing since the first 12 bodies were uncovered April 11, are among 11 people indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a four-count drug indictment.

The pair flew from <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on April 11, officials have said. In the Mexican capital, the investigation led to searches of residences where occult altars were found.

 Tens of thousands of workers rallied in central <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and marched on <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday in a May Day celebration that was delayed six days because of Orthodox Christian Easter. More than 300 Turkish and Kurdish refugees held their own demonstration and marched to the Turkish Embassy where they burned that country's flag.

 A strong earthquake Sunday struck a region of southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> where 730 people were killed by a temblor in November, but this time officials said only about 10 people were injured. Sunday's quake collapsed some houses and opened rifts in some streets in <LOCATION> Gengma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said there were no reports of deaths or injuries, but the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> quoted local authorities as saying about 10 people were injured, four seriously. The quake measured 6.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, signifying a quake capable of causing severe damage. The Nov. 6 quake that shook <PERSON> Gengma </PERSON> and devastated nearby counties was more than 10 times stronger, measuring 7.6. That quake, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s worst in 12 years, destroyed several villages in <LOCATION> Menglian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> counties, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Gengma </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Menglian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> were shaken by the new quake that hit at 9:38 a.m. Sunday. All three counties are in a remote mountainous region near the Burmese border that is prone to quakes. Gengma is largely inhabited by members of the Va and <PERSON> Dai </PERSON> minorities, most of whom farm. More than 1,300 aftershocks were recorded in less than two weeks after the Nov. 6 quake. Seismologists said after that quake that the region had entered a new period of quake activity. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Each increase of a digit indicates a 10-fold increase in severity.

 French Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> on Sunday said elections in this territory will proceed as planned, reversing an earlier decision to cancel them because of the slayings of two independence leaders. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> was among an estimated 5,000 people who attended the funerals Sunday of <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>'s top assistant, <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON>.

He was wounded in an exchange of gunfire that followed the assassinations and was hospitalized under police guard in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the provincial capital. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> on Friday had postponed the elections in the restive territory after the slayings. On Sunday, he said they would proceed as planned June 11. `` A criminal does n't stop the course of peace in progress,'' the premier said. `` Tolerance will not abdicate in the face of fanaticism.'' Last year, <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> abandoned demands for immediate independence in the territory and signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for a peace process that would end in 1998 with a referendum on independence. Many of <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>'s followers were unhappy with the accord, which was aimed at ending three years of sporadic separatist violence here. Tjibaou and <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> had gone to <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> to take part in ceremonies marking the first anniversary of the assault by <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police on a cave where separatists were holding more than 20 other <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officers hostage. The fighting left 19 separatists and two policemen dead. Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the inhabitants of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, an archipelago 1,000 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Most Kanaks favor independence. European settlers and their descendants make up 37 percent of the population and most want to remain French.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is about to launch his first diplomatic venture on Soviet soil with an appeal for superpower cooperation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and a challenge to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to make his `` new thinking'' a reality. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also will propose that the superpowers resume in June their work on a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons by 30-to-50 percent. But his focus primarily will be on regional problems that a close aide on Friday said were growing to `` frightening'' proportions. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will ask the Soviets to join the Untied States in backing direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> and to curb the $ 500 million in military aid <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> gave to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist government last year. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who held his first meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in March in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, has never been to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in private or public life. The trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also will be the first for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, who will accompany <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> along with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. One of the issues projected for discussion in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is a joint approach to terrorism. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> hopes to persuade the Soviets to end financial support to countries that sponsor terrorism. A group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts is planning to go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> later in the spring for further talks. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> set the tone for his trip in a speech Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in which he contrasted the `` new thinking'' that has marked the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> era with ` ` the reality of both Soviet capabilities and actions. He said the Soviets continue to pose a significant military threat to Western interests and sought to minimize <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s unilateral force reductions in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as still leaving the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact with a 2-to-1 edge in tanks and artillery <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said it was too early to tell whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s restructuring of the economy, known as perestroika, will succeed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s schedule will give him high visibility. Besides meetings with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Wednesday and Thursday mornings and a two-hour session with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> Thursday afternoon, several public events are planned to enhance his knowledge of Soviet affairs and get his views across to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people. These include an interview on Soviet television, meetings with Soviet parliamentarians and Jewish dissidents, and an inspection of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that will revive allegations the Soviets planted eavesdropping devices. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on Monday morning and relaxes there and meets with Finnish officials until his departure for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning. On his way home he will stop in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief Western allies at NATO headquarters. This also will provide an opportunity to try to resolve a dispute with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over short-range nuclear missiles. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is resisting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British demands that the Lance's range be extended to more than 250 miles. The German leader wants <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with the Soviets to reduce short-range weapons on both sides. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> have rejected the demands as a mistake, but may be losing ground as other countries in the 16-nation alliance tilt toward the West German position. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hope is to resolve the dispute before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> attend a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in the Belgian capital with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners May 29-30. On another arms control front, however, the administration seeks a resumption of talks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Friday that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would propose in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that negotiations to sharply reduce strategic nuclear weapons be reopened in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> the week of June 18 and basically pick up where they left off last November when they were recessed. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will not outline to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> the position the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to take on specific issues once the bargaining resumes, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. `` Essentially, we are looking for continuinity and keeping arms control on a fast track,'' an official said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had tentatively decided to resume the negotiations in mid-February. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after taking office in January, ordered a delay for a review, now complete, of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control and weapons policies.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Sunday denounced a call by an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> official to kill Westerners in retaliation for Palestinian deaths in the Israeli-occupied territories. `` I reject this call in its totality,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters in a news conference at <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Organization </LOCATION> headquarters.

<HEAD>Black Newspaper Welcomes Plan to Include Blacks in Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Arica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's largest black newspaper Sunday welcomed a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister's proposal to include blacks in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, saying the government `` has finally seen the light.'' City Press described a speech in Parliament last week by Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> as `` possibly the most significant policy statement'' ever by a senior government official. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, however, made clear that the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would oppose any system in which white interests could be overruled. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, outlining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s latest constitutional strategy, said the black majority should have a role in the Cabinet, in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and in the election of a president. He said the government might allow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to participate in political structures that transcend racial lines. `` Strange but true,'' said a City Press editorial. `` The government has finally seen the light _ realizing the need to establish an authentic Parliament that will represent all South African communities.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. Parliament has chambers for Asians and people of mixed-race, but the constitution gives almost total power to the party that wins the most votes among the 5 million whites. Militant anti-apartheid leaders, committed to the concept of one-person, one-vote, have ignored <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>' speech. But mainstream white newspapers Sunday joined <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in depicting it as a milestone. The Sunday Times, the country's largest-selling newspaper, described the speech as a `` dramatic U-turn'' and `` one of the most important policy shifts of the past decade.'' `` The government has accepted that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> be allowed to choose their own political and social groupings, irrespective of race,'' said The Sunday Times. `` The stand contradicts <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s classical apartheid dogma which holds that all South Africans must exercise their political and social rights through the group to which they belong.'' Rapport, a pro-government, <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION> newspaper, ran a front-page banner headline saying: `` Now: One Parliament.'' The accompanying article evoked the image of `` a united <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> where all _ white, black, brown and Indian _ can be represented in one Cabinet and one Parliament.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLennon </PERSON>, a political writer for the <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> newspaper group, said <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>' speech suggested the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would forsake the votes of far-right whites during the campaign leading to general elections Sept. 6. He said the Nationalists will adopt a pro-reform platform aimed at whites who favor change but not majority rule. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>' plan would lead swiftly to black domination. The anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to replace the Conservatives as the largest white opposition faction in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>' speech promising but questioned whether the rhetoric could be converted into law. City Press also expressed caution, saying blacks `` have been let down time and time again by people who make promises and never live up to them.''

<TEXT>
 Nuclear power, new technologies and a closer eye on the environment are emerging as key elements of what a senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says will be `` the first real national energy policy this country has ever had.'' Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he'll have an energy plan ready by next April, although there are indications this target may be missed. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and his chief deputy, <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, have appeared before several key industry groups recently to sketch in some of the key contours of what <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> says will be a `` common sense approach'' to putting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on a more solid energy foundation. Some of the main areas of emphasis will be familiar: greater leeway for oil companies to explore on federal lands, tax breaks for oil drillers, decontrol of natural gas prices, expansion of nuclear power and pursuit of basic research. More novel will be the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s pursuit of what <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> calls `` technology transfer'' _ ensuring that energy research advances made in the department's national scientific laboratories are made available to industry and universities. The labs' main focus is on top-secret nuclear weapons programs, but <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said they have done extensive work in unclassified energy areas. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also has said his energy strategy will be more comprehensive than anything produced during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. It will take into account, for example, the links between energy and the environment, including acid rain and the global atmospheric warming trend caused mainly by burning of fossil fuels, he said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has billed the evolving strategy as a clear departure from past policies. `` We're going to fashion the first real national energy policy this country has ever had,'' the former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> congressman said at his swearing-in ceremony April 20. The government has produced many energy policies in the past, but <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s remark seemed to reflect the fact that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy suffered from criticism by environmentalists and a lack of interest by the general public. `` You could ask 100 people if the country had an energy policy and 99 would say ` no,''' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, the energy secretary from 1982-85, said in a telephone interview. He said there was a policy but that it was not commonly recognized. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, an engineer by training and a career naval officer, wants to broaden the scope of the government's energy involvement. Beyond the traditional issues of energy production, price and supply, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> sees room for his department to help stimulate young people's interest in science, math and engineering _ areas of education that he says are vital to the nation's energy future. This is where the nuclear issue fits in. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is a devoted supporter of commercial nuclear power, and he is troubled at the depth of public distrust of this energy source, which accounts for nearly one-fifth of all electricity generation. No orders for new nuclear plants have been placed in 11 years and none are expected for the rest of the century. Scores of plants have been canceled in the past decade, and nuclear's share of energy production is projected to fall in the 1990s. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supported nuclear power but failed to revive it. This has produced two results that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> says threaten the nation's long-term energy security: a shrinking energy base and a deterioration of nuclear expertise. This is part of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' motivation for launching a publicity campaign against <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s plan to tear down the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which earlier this month was cleared for startup by federal regulators. `` Because Shoreham is the right energy source at the right time for the right place, its operation should stand as a symbol of the promise and potential of nuclear power in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said after the plant got its license. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> wants to tear it down because of doubts about whether <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> could safety evacuate in the event of an accident. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has vowed to fight the dismantlement. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is taking an analogous approach to the problem of a slumping oil industry, whose prospects for long-term revival have been damaged by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. As a result of that accident _ the biggest spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history _ industry hopes for expanding exploration on the North Slope have diminished. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has expressed alarm at the decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil production since 1986, which has coincided with a rise in oil use and a resulting jump in oil imports. Besides making the country more reliable on oil from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the domestic oil slump has weakened young people's interest in learning the business, he said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> recently cited figures showing that between 1982 and 1987 the number of freshmen enrolled in petroleum engineering schools plunged from 3,300 to 271. `` Let us at least be forward thinking enough to prepare <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s young people to be part of the energy breakthroughs of the next century,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. The technological advances that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> thinks are most important include: _ A `` clean coal'' method of burning the nation's most abundant energy source in ways that provide more power with less pollution The department plans to spend $ 5 billion through 1992 on demonstration projects by private companies. _ New designs for nuclear reactors to reduce their vulnerability to meltdowns or other serious accidents that have eroded public confidence in the industry Numerous such `` passively safe'' designs are under development. _ A superconducting super collider <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> says he will push for federal financing of the $ 5.9 billion physics installation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at which scientists plan to explore the fundamental components of matter and energy.

<DATELINE>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 400 people trudged in out of a pounding rain one recent night to hoot and holler at the city's favorite spectator sport Politics. `` Politics is like baseball in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and it's hardball all the time,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansheim </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are interested in it, they follow it and a lot of times their jobs are dependent on it, so they really live for it.'' This year, it's politics as unusual in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, an industrial waterfront city of 230,000 that sits a stone's throw from the Statue of Liberty on the western shore of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. A record 10 candidates are running for mayor in Tuesday's free-for-all If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers will spend another month hurling epithets until a June 13 runoff. The election is non-partisan, but a registered Democrat likely will win since Democrats have outnumbered Republicans as long as anyone can remember. Today the ratio is 13-to-1. The lineup of candidates includes the incumbent, two former mayors, four city councilmen, a banker, a police officer and an insurance broker. Decorum is not their best quality. Lofty promises of political reform are met with sarcasm, often sparking hearty guffaws from voters. And biting attacks abound among the candidates. In campaign advertisements, one candidate refers to his opponents as `` political hacks.'' Another says he's fighting `` The Corrupt Political Machine.'' Based on each camp's estimates, more than $ 3 million will be spent to capture the $ 65,000-a-year job. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s mayor influences spending of about $ 400 million-plus in public funds, and has final say-so on filling approximately 6,500 city jobs. Just last Tuesday, a federal judge took note of the city's patronage system, blasting incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON> for running a `` spoils system'' that punished public employees who did n't support his 1985 election bid `` His attempts to persuade the court that a new breeze blew into City Hall on July 1, 1985, ... -LRB- are -RRB- unavailing,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. He ruled that a police officer was illegally demoted for supporting then-Mayor <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> instead of <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON> in 1985. `` The air was fetid,'' added <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>. `` It was sadly, business as usual in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Battling the party machine and the old-time political bosses has become the common theme of this year's mayoral fight, as the candidates go after an electorate changed by an influx of upper-income executives and minority groups. It used to be that candidates only had to reach out to the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> strongholds in the city. But as the city changed, so did politics. It is estimated there are 15,000 people from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, 20,000 Filipinos and 10,000 Egyptians in the city, although it's unclear how many of those people are registered voters. An estimated 20,000 Hispanic and 25,000 black residents are registered to vote. For the first time, a black, Council President <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, is considered a serious mayoral contender. The campaign has stirred all the emotions of a tight baseball pennent race, which was at no time more apparent than on the rainy night of the city's first mayoral debate. Four-hundred screaming supporters crammed into a room at <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> to hear nine of the candidates take potshots at each other. <PERSON> Mansheim </PERSON> said he sees <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> and two-term Councilman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fricchione </PERSON> as the four most likely candidates to make it to the runoff election. The others, he said, are running not to win the mayor's seat, but to win influence. `` That's a major part of the reason for running for mayor,'' <PERSON> Mansheim </PERSON> said. `` Even if they do n't have a chance, they'll negotiate, for jobs mostly It's not winner-take-all in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> by a longshot.''

<HEAD>Eastern Advertises for Mechanics; Union Says It's a Ploy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> began advertising for mechanics Sunday, but <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union officials said the ads were merely ploys to lure striking mechanics over the picket line. `` All of it is for purely psychological reasons,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, treasurer of Machinists Local 702. `` It's the same stuff they've been doing for years here: ` See if we can beat them down.''' Eastern took out ads in newspapers in 10 cities Sunday seeking mechanics to replace <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members who have been on strike since March 4. The Miami-based carrier was almost grounded when pilots honored picket lines, and the airline filed for bankruptcy protection four days into the strike. The airline started hiring new pilots in the strike's first month and had added 264 as of Friday. Two pilots have already completed training; the rest are still being trained. The airline also has begin hiring and trining new flight attendants. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said wages offered new mechanics will range from $ 10 to $ 18 an hour. That is about what the company was paying the Machinists when the union struck, refusing wage cuts of more than a third for some members. The newspaper ads say: `` Understand that given the current strike ... your assignment at Eastern may require you to perform services or replace employees involved in a labor dispute. But also understand that this is an unprecedented opportunity for growth and success.'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the company expects many inquiries from experienced mechanics. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said it's unlikely Eastern will be able to hire qualified mechanics because other major carriers who are hiring mechanics offer more stability and better wages. `` They would get people who have been rejected by the other carriers,'' he said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said handfuls of strikers `` have dribbled across'' the picket lines with the strike in its third month. He said he did n't expect large numbers to go back because of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s new offer He added that it takes up to two years to fully train a mechanic to work on jetliners. Eastern officials said they could n't estimate how long it will take to train their new mechanics without knowing their experience. The company plans to hire 500 non-union mechanics in the next few months. `` We've said we have to rebuild the airline and the unions flat-out have said they will not come back for current management,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it should come as a surprise.'' Under its rebuilding plan, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> wants 2,500 mechanics. The company had more than that when the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which also represents ramp agents, janitors and other ground workers, walked out. Eastern must have bankruptcy court approval of its plan. The court set a Wednesday deadline for offers from interested buyers.

 Candidates for federal judge who belong to discriminatory clubs are finding last-minute resignations may not be enough to win over critics and save their chances for a seat on the bench. `` Resigning immediately prior to being appointed or knowing that one may be appointed is not adequate,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` It misses the point. The concern is that the jurist is going to be considered open-minded and fair.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ which makes the final decision on judicial confirmation _ thus far has not flatly ruled out approval of nominees who belong to discriminatory clubs, but the pendulum appears headed that way. In practice, consideration of potentially controversial nominees sometimes simply grinds to a halt without formal, public action. One attorney's hopes for a seat on the bench fizzled in 1988 when he waited until two weeks before his scheduled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing to resign from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s exclusive <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and told a black group he never felt `` any kind of moral fire within my belly to go out and correct what is perceived to be wrong by some.'' A 17-year-veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> saw his hopes die last year after he balked when lawmakers urged him to resign from a country club with no black members and specific restrictions on women. He said he would not bow to political pressure `` to enhance my chances for confirmation.'' The new concern about club memberships goes beyond the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> last week took steps to revise its rules and ban judges from being members of clubs that `` invidiously discriminate.'' It could be the group's official policy by February 1990. No one is challenging the right of private clubs to discriminate, as long as they are truly private and not merely wearing that label as a means of dodging the public accommodations laws. The question is how much membership in such a club should weigh as lawmakers consider attorneys for lifetime appointments to the bench and whether judges who belong to clubs that discriminate can ever project an image of fairness. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> says he could support a member of a discriminatory club for judge if the candidate had consistently worked to change such policies. But he scoffs at last-minute resignations merely to appease the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., another <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, says, however, that membership in such a club `` should n't be the sole and only reason for knocking the guy down if he's extremely well qualified. `` It should not be used in the most extraordinary or absurd ways that it's used sometimes in the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' he says. `` If you like the guy's philosophy and you think he's great, you do n't care what the heck he belongs to.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> says the club issue has not been applied evenly and cites a pending dispute about the nomination of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> for a <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeship in that city. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, nominated by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, stoutly defended <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s 128-year-old Olympic Club last year and failed to win approval from the committee. The club had a handful of black members and bylaw provisions that bar women. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s nomination was submitted again by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> resigned from the club in February. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> notes that <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a member of the same club and resigned a month before his 1987 hearing before the committee. He says the panel was tolerant of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s belated resignation `` because he was exceptionally well qualified.'' As for <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> says, `` They're still ramming it to him.'' `` The whole transgression of his entire life is that he was a member of this same sinister club,'' says <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. `` I think that's stupid. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., is protesting <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s defense of the club in testimony last `` I have reached the conclusion that his actions with respect to his membership in a discriminatory club are disqualifying,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said in an April 4 letter to <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> should not be confirmed. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, nominated at the urging of Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., declined to return repeated telephone calls to his office and home <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s critics, however, say they see a sharp difference between the case of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and that of <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. They note that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> resigned from another club in 1980 after advising it of his concern about its discriminatory policies. And they cite his answer before the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when asked why it took him so long to leave the Olympic Club. He said that over the years he had `` tried to become more sensitive to the existence of subtle barriers to the advancement of women and of minorities in society. And this was an issue on which I was continuing to educate myself.''

<HEAD>Cheney Wants Controversial Helicopter As Osprey Replacement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s cost-cutting move to scrap the V-22 Osprey aircraft includes a plan to replace it with the Super Stallion, a problem-plagued helicopter under investigation for possible design flaws. A congressional firestorm over scrapping the Osprey can only be fueled by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s turn toward the Sikorsky Aircraft CH-53E Super Stallion, the western world's largest helicopter, lawmakers say. The Osprey is designed to take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> wants it for surprise, long-range amphibious assaults. The government has invested $ 2 billion in its development. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, however, says that the Osprey must go as part of his move to cut $ 10 billion in spending under the budget agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rebuffed congressional demands in 1987 for grounding the Super Stallion and instead ordered Sikorsky to conduct a $ 9 million review to determine if a design flaw triggered seven crashes between June 1984 and January 1987 that left 20 Marines dead. That review, due last summer but delayed by additional <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> requests, was delivered to the Pentagon in early February with the company declaring the helicopter safe. Dissatisfied Pentagon officials sent it back to the company last month for further tests, according to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. `` We felt there were some areas of the TEP -LRB- test and evaluation program -RRB- that had to be amplified,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sikorsky </PERSON> says it will resubmit the review this summer. The Pentagon does not expect a final determination on the study until October, which means debate over Super Stallion and Osprey funding for fiscal 1990 will rage on without the benefit of the helicopter's safety report. Some Super Stallion critics are ready to fight <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s plan to buy more of the helicopters in the absence of a Pentagon-approved Sikorsky review. `` Until they can answer the question and do the review ... we need to put this on hold,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif., a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and a leading critic of the Super Stallion But <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s request for more Super Stallions, which would revive a program that was scheduled to end in the 1990 budget, indicates <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> confidence in the helicopter, Sikorsky officials maintain. `` They're anticipating that the good name of the helicopter will be gotten back, as the results of the testing show,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a Sikorsky vice president in charge of the Super Stallion program. `` In a way, they have built in an anticipatory approval by <ORGANIZATION> NavAir </ORGANIZATION> of the work that has been done.'' Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's budget, the Super Stallion program was to have ended in the 1990 budget year with just three more helicopters ordered. But to compensate for the planned elimination of the new Ospreys, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> wants to buy 23 Super Stallions for 1990 and is expected to ask for 23 annually in each subsequent year well into the 1990s, according to congressional and industry sources. The Super Stallions cost about $ 16 million each. Although the tilt-rotor <PERSON> Osprey </PERSON> could take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane, military strategists believe the Super Stallion can handle much of the Osprey's heavy-lift mission for the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The Super Stallion is a modified version of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era CH-53D Sea Stallion. The Super Stallion, with its larger rotors and a third engine, can lift up to 18 tons, about double the old Sea Stallion's capacity. But critics say the 16 -LCB- - ton helicopter is simply too big and should have been designed from scratch, not modified from the smaller Sea Stallion `` It was designed too large and there's no way you can make it safe because of its size,'' said <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>.

 They thought they were getting free sneakers, but 69 criminal suspects got snookered instead when they showed up at a phony shoe store `` for people on the run'' and were arrested on outstanding warrants. `` I knew this was too good to be true!'' one suspect exclaimed as he was handcuffed by sheriff's deputies during the two-day sting operation. `` I've never won anything.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, masquerading as an athletic footwear business, mailed 500 letters to people with outstanding arrest warrants offering a free pair of athletic shoes just for filling out a survey. The suspects were invited to show up at the new <ORGANIZATION> Grabar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Footwear </ORGANIZATION> store _ `` a new concept in shoe stores for people on the run.'' The name was a takeoff on <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, a slang term for jail. By 8 p.m. Saturday, little was left of <PERSON> Grabar </PERSON>. A small sign on the door read `` Grabar Shoes closed. We'll catch you next time!!'' <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tussing </PERSON> said human nature helped net 69 suspects on 96 active arrest warrants Friday and Saturday. `` I think when you appeal to people's greed, I think that's why it was successful,'' <PERSON> Tussing </PERSON> said. `` Everybody wants to get something for nothing.'' The warrants were for offenses ranging from traffic infractions to burglary, assault, drug possession and theft. The majority were for minor offenses. After being taken to jail, suspects were required to post a bond or pay whatever fines or costs they owed. One man arrested for back child support had to pay $ 3,000. Of the 500 letters mailed, about 120 were returned because of incorrect or outdated addresses, <PERSON> Tussing </PERSON> said. In similar operations around the country, a 10 percent arrest rate has been considered successful, he said. Three people who were arrested on outstanding warrants also were arrested for marijuana possession at the `` store,'' and one person was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon -LRB- brass knuckles -RRB-. `` Some of these people have not committed real serious crimes, but they have n't lived up to their responsibilities to pay fines or whatever,'' <PERSON> Tussing </PERSON> said. `` It sends the message that we're not going to ignore this stuff.''

<HEAD>Beijing University Students Set Conditions for Returning to Class</HEAD>

 Student leaders at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday they will continue to boycott classes for at least five more days and may hold more marches through the city to press their demands for democratic reforms. Late Sunday, about 50 students marched around the university campus chanting, `` Continue the strike! Continue the strike!'' The cry soon was picked up by classmates shouting from dormitory windows. Students at other universities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that participated in the class boycott have decided to return to class after staging several mass demonstrations that brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets. But the independent student union at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's most prestigious school, decided at a meeting Sunday night to continue the boycott through Friday. `` We are the only ones keeping the flame,'' said one student leader. The boycott began April 24. The group listed as conditions for returning to class government recognition of new student unions that have organized the fledgling pro-democracy movement; reinstatement of a recently fired liberal <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> newspaper editor; changing city laws that restrict demonstrations; and an apology from the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper for `` distorted reporting'' of the student movement. If the government fails to meet the conditions or refuses to hold a dialogue with pro-democracy students, further protest marches may be called, <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student activists said. One new poster at the university suggested daily sit-ins at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic center of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` All of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> watches <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. All of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> watches <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>,'' another poster said. The largest protests in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history, in which tens of thousands of students and workers marched through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, have resulted in conciliatory statements from the nation's leaders and political debate that would have been unimaginable just one month earlier. But leading student activists seem unsure of what to do next to keep up the movement's momentum. Although <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> on Thursday called for talks with students, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership has refused to talk with the independent student unions. A new group of pro-democracy students was set up last week to initiate talks with the government. It sent a written appeal to party and government leaders, who promised to reply Monday. <PERSON> Xiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoji </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dialogue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday the group wanted to `` raise some constructive proposals for the future building of democracy and the legal system.'' Issues he named for discussion included education, family planning and price reform, but he did not mention establishing a free press and fighting corruption _ major demands of the democracy movement. `` We do n't set ourselves up as the government's opponent,'' <PERSON> Xiang </PERSON> said. `` Our government is the people's government, and we are citizens.''

<HEAD>Federal Budget Writers Moving Quickly, But Still Face Rocky Path</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' work on a $ 1.2 trillion federal budget for next year is sliding ahead smoothly, but lawmakers now face a series of prickly decisions on taxes, spending and _ of course _ politics. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> each signed off on a pair of spending plans Thursday. No surprise there: The documents reflected deals honed last month between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials and congressional leaders, and the chambers' votes were little more than exercises in rubber stamping. Negotiators from the two houses plan to meet this week to work out a compromise budget. That job, too, is expected to be sweat-free, because the two measures differ only slightly in how they would distribute money among science, housing and other domestic programs. There are three major landmarks lying ahead, however, where jolting crunches could occur. First up is additional revenues, which are supposed to account for about half of the $ 28 billion in deficit reduction in the package. The budget says $ 5.3 billion is to come from increased tax receipts. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has claimed the budget allows him to honor his campaign mantra of `` no new taxes,'' but strictly speaking that has yet to be decided. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says $ 4.8 billion of the amount can be raised by lowering the capital gains tax. His argument it that such a cut will spark the economy and thus boost the government's overall tax take. Democrats largely oppose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s idea, calling it a boon for the wealthy. Ominously, Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which writes tax legislation, calls the plan `` unpalatable. The result: gridlock. `` Where are they going to deliver from?'' asks <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, who monitors budget activity. An additional $ 5.7 billion is supposed to come from sales of government assets, and $ 2.7 billion more is slated to be raised by increasing fees for certain federal services. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has rejected some of these before, and could do so again. The second hurdle is the question of fiscal 1991. It does n't begin until Oct. 1, 1990, but lawmakers and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have promised to try to complete a budget pact for that year over the next few months An early deal gives <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a feather in his cap, and helps legislators avoid imposing pain _ in the form of any resulting taxes or spending cuts _ on their constituents during an election year. This may not be easy. The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law requires a 1991 shortfall of no more than $ 64 billion _ formidable considering this year's red ink should reach about $ 160 billion. Many lawmakers say slashes of that magnitude will require lots of give on both sides: an acceptance of taxes by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and of domestic program cuts by Democrats. Opinions vary on whether that will occur, or whether the result will be a conglomeration of bookkeeping tricks, one-time windfalls like asset sales, and heavy reliance on rosy economic projections that make the deficit look smaller. `` Next year, senators on both sides of the aisle will be demanding more deficit reduction than we had this year,'' predicts Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't know how we get around it next year, but mark my words, we will,'' counters Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., a member of the budget panel Hurdle No. 3 comes Aug. 15, when the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> is required to update its projection of the coming year's deficit with fresh economic figures. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, should <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> determine that the shortfall will exceed the 1990 target of $ 110 billion, a process begins that could result in sweeping, politically unpalatable spending cuts. Most budget-watchers doubt <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> would upset things by deciding that things are off course. ` The general assumption is that when the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> came up with their agreement, implicit was that <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> would n't change the numbers very much'' in August, says <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Collender </PERSON>, who watches budget action for the Price Waterhouse accounting firm.

<TEXT>
 Hours after last month's slaying of an American colonel, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was asked her reaction to the killing. She said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security must have been inadequate. A few days later, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she expected that preliminary talks on a new treaty on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases _ one of the country's most divisive issues _ will begin this year. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, clearly caught by surprise at an apparent policy reversal, issued his own statement insisting the government still has not decided whether to allow the bases to remain after their lease expires in 1991. The two statements are examples of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s tendency to make off-the-cuff public statements, which appear overly simplistic and display a lack of skill in communicating policy. `` It's amazing how President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is now often caught blurting out things that other statesmen would hesitate to say under the same circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON>, editor in chief of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't know if these were remarks made for calculated effect or were lapses whose implications were not immediately clear to the president,'' he added. Often, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s answers to reporters' questions on important national issues appear aimed at dodging responsibility and display a strangely detached view of events. After Communist rebels killed <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> on April 21, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials here had been stepping up security but that the measures obviously were insufficient. Protection of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and other foreign officials is the responsibility of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government. Only later, when she visited the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy for a memorial service, did she express grief at the death of an officer assigned to assist her own armed forces. During a recent conversation with reporters, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was asked to comment on reports from a left-wing West German publication that <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operative. Instead of dismissing the claim, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> suggested the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should comment publicly on the charge. That appeared to give credence to the allegation, made by former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operative <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>, and served to keep the charge on the front pages of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers for two more days. Eventually, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she was satisfied with <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>'s denial of the charge Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s media problems are based in part on an inefficient system of access and a haphazard formula for obtaining the president's views and comments. Press Secretary <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> resigned last month effective May 16, and no successor has been named. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> was the fourth presidential press secretary since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office three years ago. His tenure was marked by frequent battles with the press over the issue of presidential access. For months, reporters' access was limited largely to `` ambush'' interviews, where journalists would gather at the entrance to her office and bark a few questions as she arrived or left. That was replaced by a system in which reporters would submit daily written questions. A few hours later, reporters received terse written replies, ostensibly from the president. The presidential staff has recently revived the weekly `` mini press conference,'' in which a few Filipino reporters meet with the president. Reporters from foreign news organizations are excluded.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, one of 10 people who graduated from a special nursing assistants course for the homeless, said his new job will be `` just the beginning'' of his plans to be a doctor some day. `` It gave me a second chance in life,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Saturday as he graduated from the training course offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> shelter and the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> public schools' adult education center. It is believed to be the first in the nation to train the homeless to be nurses assistants. `` At 39 years old, it's not easy to just jump up and say, ` I need a second chance.''' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> moved to Samaritan House with his 14-year-old son this spring. He said he dropped out of college after a few years, lost direction, floated through a series of temporary jobs, then could n't support both himself and his son after his estranged wife no longer could keep the boy. At a graduation ceremony Saturday at the governor's mansion, schools Superintendent <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Koeppe </PERSON> called the `` Operation Opportunity'' course a `` win-win'' endeavor that trains the homeless to get jobs and also eases the national nursing shortage. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., spoke at the ceremony, saying that the program illustrates that `` we have got to get together on this issue of homelessness ... and help each other keep moving forward. `` I salute your grit, your backbone, your intellect ... and your perseverance,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> told the eight graduates who attended the ceremony, dressed in white nursing uniforms. Twelve shelter residents were selected a month ago to participate in the three-week, crash program for nursing assistants at the adult education center. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said they took classes all day, were tutored at night, and burned the midnight oil studying together. Ten graduated, all with a B average or better, and have been guaranteed jobs at two nursing homes. The graduates will make more than $ 5 an hour plus benefits, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the education center. `` That's a far cry from the dead-end, minimum-wage job,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rembert </PERSON>, who directs the jobs program at <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and selected the 12 original students, said the graduates will help shatter stereotypes of the homeless. `` I was looking for five success stories,'' she said. `` We had 10.''

<HEAD>Wealth Escapes Speaker Despite Sweetheart Deals, Bailouts by Friends</HEAD>

 Starting with a fortuitous opportunity to invest in a gas well in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> staked much of his financial future on oil and gas investments. He usually made money, received a sweetheart deal or two and occasionally was bailed out of financial jams by friends and associates. But the transactions never made <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> rich. And at least one major non-energy investment turned into a substantial loss for the future <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker, whose financial climb began only after years spent in debt. Now battling <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee charges that he may have committed 69 rules violations in his private business transactions, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was a self-described pauper in 1971. `` My finances are a shambles,'' he wrote in his diary Dec. 30 that year. `` With what unbelievable folly have I so long ignored them and let them drift ... I'm driving a 10-year-old car, owe so god-awful much money I'll need luck to pay it off. But I will, somehow I will.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s luck changed one day early in 1979, when he showed up early for a scheduled lunch with a family of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> oil investors, the <ORGANIZATION> Moncriefs </ORGANIZATION>. By chance, family members told the ethics committee, the oilmen began discussing whether to invest in an east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gas well. Family patriarch and oil lobbyist <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>, and his son <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>, had little interest in the relatively small investment. But <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> suggested that his grandfather make the deal for some of the other grandchildren <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and asked if he wanted `` to take a little interest in this deal.'' The then-House majority leader accepted, later investing $ 19,788. Before that day <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had assets of between $ 72,000 and $ 170,000 _ mostly the value of his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> home _ according to his 1978 financial disclosure form. The report requires listings of income and assets only in broad ranges. From then forward, his finances improved. But it was a roller coaster ride _ up one year, down the next _ according to a record pieced together from his own congressionally required disclosure statements, the report of the ethics committee's special counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, and published material. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> profited from interests in oil and gas wells, a handsome return on two oil stocks sold by his half-owned investment company, <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> gemstone and real estate investments. But he lost most of $ 100,000 he had borrowed to invest in a nursing home company that later filed for bankruptcy protection, even though he got back at least $ 22,000 in dividends that other shareholders were unsuccessful in obtaining, according to published reports. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s most profitable deal was in 1988, just before he sold his half of <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> to his partner, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. By that time <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s share was part of a blind trust he created in 1987. He directed the trustee to sell his share to recoup enough money to pay off the nursing home loan. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, meanwhile, was looking for a last, `` bet the farm'' investment. It turned up with the purchase and same-day resale of an interest in an prospective oil and gas well. <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> bought the well for $ 9,120 in cash and sold it for a $ 340,000 profit. The well turned up dry. The ethics committee is still investigating that pair of transactions, even as it plans for hearings on the 69 unrelated allegations that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> circumvented <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> income limits and accepted improper gifts from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. According to his disclosure statements, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s income was between $ 85,703 and $ 101,700 in 1979. It climbed to between $ 192,560 and $ 326,550 in 1983, the year he sold his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> home, and peaked at $ 358,764 to $ 736,758 in 1986, when he earned significant oil and gas revenue and profited from a cable television stock sale. In 1987, it fell to between $ 169,185 and $ 177,682. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> listed the value of his holdings in 1983, the peak year, at between $ 415,015 and $ 1,075,000. Half the total was attributed to investments in oil and gas wells and the value of his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> home. By 1987, when the holdings went into the blind trust, his listed assets dropped to a range of between $ 155,000 and $ 435,000. Part of the difference can be attributed to the way speaker filled out his disclosure forms. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sold his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> home, valued at between $ 100,001 and $ 250,000 in August 1983, and purchased a more expensive home in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, which last year was appraised at more than $ 352,000, according to the Wall Street Journal. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat's <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> home was listed as an asset in accordance with the rules because it produced rental income. The <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> home apparently had no rental income and was not listed as part of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s holdings. Another possible contributor for the drop in assets was <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s disastrous 1983 investment in <ORGANIZATION> Jewell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a nursing home venture Whether or not <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received favored treatment through dividend payments, as other <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON> stockholders told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> last week, his investment became worthless when the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 and later began liquidation.

 <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> often had to borrow money to make his investments. Often, he also relied on friends and business associates to bail him out. His first gas well investment in 1979 with the <ORGANIZATION> Moncriefs </ORGANIZATION> is an example. In 1983, both demand and prices for natural gas had declined, and no gas was being extracted from the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> well. By December of that year, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> owed a bank $ 20,600 in principal and interest on the loan that financed his investment in the venture. A month later the now-deceased oilman, <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>, bought back <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest in well for $ 20,000 and the speaker used the money to pay off his loan. Over the 4 -LCB- - year investment, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> paid more than $ 30,000 in drilling and monthly operating costs, but earned $ 39,353 _ $ 20,000 coming from the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> bailout <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also had purchased from <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> interest in a second east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> well known to contain substantial quantities of natural gas. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hockaday </PERSON>, an independent oil and gas consultant, told the ethics committee that deal posed no risk for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` I would be prone to think it was a sweetheart agreement,'' <PERSON> Hockaday </PERSON> testified. `` You know, I would love to have a chance to do that every day.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> paid $ 50,000 for his interest, $ 35,000 of it from a bank loan. But <PERSON> Hockaday </PERSON> calculated the value of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest at $ 132,000 to $ 140,000, because it was clear the well would produce gas. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> held onto the well at least through late 1988, paying a total of $ 56,475 in drilling and monthly operation costs and receiving income of $ 74,480 from the venture, according to the ethics committee's counsel. It was in 1980 that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, formed <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>. The company enjoyed early success through transactions in oil stocks. An investment in <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> Oil netted $ 83,000 in profits in five months. Buying and selling <ORGANIZATION> Supron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock resulted in a $ 27,500 profit over 14 months, according to the ethics panel's counsel In addition, a $ 40,000 investment in gemstones brought in distributions of $ 62,950, A profit of $ 41,182 was made on a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> real estate deal. But <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> lost money on other stock deals _ $ 6,314 in one case, $ 1,115 in another and $ 700 in a third instance. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and his wife, often had to borrow to make Mallightco investments, sometimes borrowing from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> itself. By the end of 1981, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, owed their company nearly $ 120,000. By 1984, the Wrights were no longer meeting the interest payments on their debt owed <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>. `` The company never demanded payment from the Wrights or took any steps to collect the debt,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s report said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> on Sunday said Western allies must not let a feud over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s short-range nuclear missiles become the central issue of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also reiterated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s demand that the superpowers begin talks soon on reducing the short-range missiles. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> oppose the talks. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to delay until 1992 a decision on whether to modernize short-range Lance missiles based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But, in an apparent effort to tone down the dispute that has split the alliance, he said said the disagreement should not become a dominant issue. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, in a speech in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> to mark the beginning of `` German-American Friendship Week,'' said: `` It would be out of all proportion if the question of whether to decide upon a new weapons system ... is made into the central issue of the alliance.'' A copy of <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s speech was released in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> oppposes any negotiations on grounds that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needs the missiles to compensate for the overwhelming superiority of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces. It also says the Lance rockets soon will be obsolete and must be modernized to travel greater distances. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear missiles are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government is losing support in public opinion polls and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> fears a decision to deploy new missiles could cost him the next federal election in December 1990. Referring to a wave of reforms in the Soviet bloc, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said the Western alliance should use the `` historical opportunity'' to forge new East-West relations. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, speaking at the same ceremony in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, warned <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> against `` overestimating the significance of political changes'' in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 A card game in Deadwood got Wild <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON> killed, but things have quieted down since the legendary lawman was gunned down during a hand of poker in the frontier town's shoot -'em up True, blackjack and poker are on their way back, but the new dealers of Deadwood are taking a college-sponsored course to learn how to lay out the cards, and the newly legalized gambling will be deliberately a low-stakes affair. `` I grew up in Deadwood. This is like going back in time and reliving a part of Deadwood's past,'' says <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Keehn </PERSON> <PERSON> Struble </PERSON>, 23, whose family owns the saloon where <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON> died in 1876 holding his legendary `` dead man's hand'' of aces and eights. <PERSON> Struble </PERSON> is enrolled in a course that is training blackjack dealers for the historic <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> town's new gambling halls. She plans to work as a dealer in the family's No. 10 Saloon. `` There's a lot to learn,'' <PERSON> Struble </PERSON> says. `` There's so much concentration involved.'' Voters statewide authorized limited gambling in Deadwood last November. Only blackjack, poker and slot machines are allowed, and bets may not exceed $ 5. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, appointed last month, said gambling could start late this summer. The blackjack dealers' course, which began last week, is offered through <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vocational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Twenty-eight students are enrolled in the first session. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteaker </PERSON>, coordinator of adult business and industry training, said educators consulted with community colleges in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to design the course. `` You do n't go out and find a blackjack dealing curriculum on the shelf,'' he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornhill </PERSON>, a former dealers-school owner with 10 years' experience dealing in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, teaches the course He says <PERSON> Deadwood </PERSON>'s focus on low-key gambling and games of skill should lead to success for the town of 2,000 and its players. <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> said the panel must hire a staff, write rules to control gambling and devise a security system to prevent corruption. <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> said the commission has requested copies of gaming rules from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and other states where limited gambling is allowed. The city's share of gambling revenue will go toward historic preservation, and locals say they want to keep the old-time western atmosphere in and the glitz out of this gambling center. `` The fact that we've limited the bets to five dollars is going to be less intimidating to people,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a gambling supporter and owner of the Franklin Hotel. `` You ca n't have a sign that says ` casino.' Traditionally, we called them poker rooms and gambling halls. There'll be no blinking neon lights in Deadwood. `` There are very few towns in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that have that Western mystique,'' he said. As <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> put it, `` We'll never be a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> or an <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said operators of large casinos are watching Deadwood with interest to see how the gambling venture fares. `` If we just imitate our past, we'll be successful,'' he said. `` If we become more than that, sort of a Western Disneyland of gambling, there'll be a lot of outside investors looking at us. There's that big question mark out there right now. We just do n't know.

<HEAD>PEN Writers' Group Expected To Approve Soviet Chapter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAASTRICHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 PEN is expected to admit a new Soviet chapter this week in a move that would open the international writers' group to artists from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the first time in 65 years. <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION>'s international secretary, said in an interview on Sunday that he expects the organization's 53rd International Conference to admit the Soviet chapter in a vote Wednesday. `` They're certainly welcome and I think there will be no difficulty,'' <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON> said of the Soviet chapter, which was formed last year. The PEN conference, a gathering of 300 novelists, poets, playwrights and other literary figures, opens in Maastricht on Monday. Those attending will represent the 10,000 members of <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION>, or Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists, a London-based group with about 60 chapters in its member nations. In 1924, <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> turned down the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s request to join the group, and since then the writers' group has consistently opposed Soviet membership because of the nation's persecution of writers and intellectuals. The first official act of the new Soviet PEN chapter was to condemn the death threat <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> issued against British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, according to the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>. If the Soviet chapter is approved, its members will have to sign the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> charter, which condemns censorship and says `` free criticism of governments, administrations and institutions -LRB- is -RRB- imperative.'' The newspaper said members of the Soviet chapter include poets <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Voznesensky </PERSON>, novelists <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chengiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON>, historian <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, and playwright <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>. The approval of the Soviet chapter would be a significant breakthrough for Soviet writers, who were isolated from many international cultural groups until their nation's intellectual climate began to improve recently. It would also be the latest indication that Western organizations approve of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness in Soviet cultural and intellectual affairs. One obstacle to Soviet membership has been the large number of languages used in the country, <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON> said. Because PEN chapters are usually open to only one language group, the Soviets would be entitled to dozens of chapters and therefore be able to exert a disproportionate amount of influence, he said. Under a compromise hammered out by the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> leadership in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month, the Soviets would be allowed to open a maximum of five chapters, said <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitov </PERSON>, a novelist heading the six-man delegation of Soviet observers at the conference, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Soviet PEN membership would be only `` one of the smaller changes'' made possible by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` This organization was understood to be by those in power as reactionary -LRB- and -RRB- anti-Soviet,'' he said. Even now, `` A lot of Soviet writers regard this only as an organization of prestige, not as an organization which will struggle against censorship -LRB- and for -RRB- the human rights of a writer,'' said <PERSON> Bitov </PERSON>, who himslef faced a six-year publication ban from 1979-85.

<HEAD>Soviets May Seek Extradition of Hockey Star</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet military authorities may seek the extradition of a Soviet hockey star on charges he deserted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> when he defected to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> newspaper said Sunday. Lt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> disappeared Thursday in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, after helping the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> win the World Hockey Championships. The 20-year-old forward, considered one of the country's best prospects, arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a day later on an airline ticket paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> club that had chosen him in last year's player draft. His story was recounted Sunday in the newspaper Sovietsky Sport under the headline, `` The Golden Calf and the Horsethieves from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>.'' Like many Soviet athletes, <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> is a junior officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and the newspaper quoted a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> prosecutor as saying the hockey star is now under investigation for desertion. `` If the crime is confirmed, I think we will ask for extradition of the officer,'' said Col. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Obyektov </PERSON>, prosecutor for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> garrison. `` Evasion of military service and desertion is considered to be a grave crime in all countries,'' <PERSON> Obyektov </PERSON> said. `` To study all the details of this affair, we will request through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs legal assistance of the appropriate <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. organizations.'' `` The investigation will include the interrogation of <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> and any other searches for facts which might be required,'' the prosecutor said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have an extradition agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to an embassy spokesman in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he noted, `` There have been a lot of defectors, and I'm sure many could have been charged with a violation of some Soviet law.'' The Sovietsky Sport article was one of many in Soviet newspapers that strongly criticized <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> team, for succumbing to the lure of capitalist cash. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> complained that the `` runaway'' had been spoiled in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with everything he wanted. Having consumed everything the Soviet economy could provide, `` thoughts of the forward stretched beyond the ocean where carrots are sweeter and pay is larger,'' the newspaper said. But another star Soviet hockey player, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Firsov </PERSON>, said such a defection should have been expected because of a long-simmering dispute between national team members who want to play for the West and a resisting coach, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON>. `` The situation on the team is explosive, and something like that had to happen,'' said <PERSON> Firsov </PERSON>, a newly elected member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Soviet sports authorities were due to discuss the signing of several hockey players with the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> after the team's return from <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in general has become increasingly receptive to overtures from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> professional sports leagues interested in acquiring Soviet players.

<HEAD>Greek-Cypriot Soldier Commits Suicide After Wounding Turkish-Cypriot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Greek-Cypriot </LOCATION> soldier apparently committed suicide Sunday after he fired across the Green Line that divides the capital and wounded a <LOCATION> Turkish-Cypriot </LOCATION> soldier, said a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` The preliminary indications are that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> soldier fired several shots,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulkin </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force that patrols the buffer zone on the war-divided island. `` He apparently hit the Turkish soldier in the right leg and then shot himself.'' <PERSON> Gaulkin </PERSON> said the investigation was continuing into the incident at the 40-yard buffer zone in the <LOCATION> Kaymakli </LOCATION> district of the capital. `` We have no indication of why he shot himself,'' <PERSON> Gaulkin </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government denied the Greek Cypriot fired across the buffer zone. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued an official statement saying that <PERSON> Nikolaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelides </PERSON>, 19, from <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, was standing guard on the Green Line at 5:30 a.m. when he died. The statement said he died from a self-inflicted wound but that it was unclear whether it was an accident or a suicide. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Erbil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavran </PERSON>, 20, from <LOCATION> Kyrenia </LOCATION>, was in serious condition after being shot in the leg. It said he was fired at three times from 40 yards across the buffer zone. <PERSON> Sheena </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an artist who lives near the Green Line in the district, said she heard `` a lot of bangs'' at the time. `` There were three shots and then a little gap and then four or five shots. Then it went quiet.'' <PERSON> Gaulkin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops from the Canadian contingent arrived soon after the shooting but that each side had evacuated its casualty. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been partitioned since Turkish troops invaded in 1974. Conscripts from the 13,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> are posted along the confrontation line slicing through the old walled city in the center of the Cypriot capital. Thousands of Turkish and <LOCATION> Turkish-Cypriot </LOCATION> soldiers are stationed along the northern side of the line. The two communities have agreed to a limited disengagement following a sharp increase last year in shooting incidents along the buffer zone. Five people were killed by gunfire between May and December last year, the same number of fatalities reported between 1976 and May 1988.

<HEAD>Economic Turmoil Heralds Peronist Victory; Vote Set May 14</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Presidential campaigns wind up this week much as they began: <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leads in the polls and <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> is plagued by his governing party's economic failures. Three fringe candidates have staked out issues further to the right and left but were expected to receive only 11 percent of the ballots on May 14. Argentines were also to vote for one-half the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, as well as state legislators in 16 of the 22 provinces. `` <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> could win, but his deficit is very big. If you ask me, it is n't very likely,'' said pollster <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> y <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON>. His survey two weeks ago gave the <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> candidate 29 percent of the vote, with 34 percent going to <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> and 21 percent to undecideds. Polls published April 30 in the capital's two largest circulation dailies, <PERSON> Clarin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION>, gave <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> a 10-point edge, 36 percent to 26 percent for <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>. But one in four voters was undecided. The main issue is the economy, which has declined for the past four decades but plunged this year. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s currency, the austral, has been devalued by about 80 percent since February, igniting 35 percent monthly inflation. Wages have not kept pace, business is in disarray, and basic goods like medicine, milk and spare parts for industry are in short supply or sold at several times the price of two months ago. Today's images of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are empty shelves at pharmacies, long lines at foreign exchange houses, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> out of paper to print money, doctors and teachers and mail carriers on strike, a poor housewife buying eggs and apples for her family, one at a time. `` I was better off five years ago than I am now,'' said <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Battiato </PERSON>, a 31-year-old repairman for the state telephone company. `` I voted for -LRB- President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. I wo n't vote for <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, a 57-year-old provincial governor, has n't thrown in the towel. At rallies last week he attracted large crowds. Aides predict 200,000 will attend his closing rally in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>'s prescription for the country's economic ills is conservative: sell inefficient state companies, balance the national budget, encourage foreign investment, curb the power of organized labor, increase exports, pay the foreign debt. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, a 58-year-old governor, recognizes the same problems _ triple-digit inflation, high unemployment, stagnant gross national product, a foreign debt of $ 59 billion that is third highest in the developing world _ but proposes other solutions. To curb the budget deficit he would raise taxes. To reduce the burden of state companies, he would increase their efficiency rather than sell them. To resolve the foreign debt, he would negotiate with creditors a moratorium on payments for several years. The two represent different constituencies _ <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, the middle class, and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, organized labor, state employees and the poor. Apartment owners have taken their properties off the market, fearing if elected, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> might implement a rent freeze. Investors have sent hundreds of millions of dollars out of the country, fearing exchange controls under a <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> government. Watching developments from the sidelines are the armed forces, which overthrew <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in 1955, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Frondizi </PERSON> in 1962, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Illia </PERSON> in 1966 and <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in 1976. Disgruntled officers staged three insurrections against President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> between April 1987 and December 1988, with the trials of officers a key grievance. <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> has tried to distance himself from an unpopular government and capitalize on what he calls the public `` fear of <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>.'' At every opportunity, he brings up the street violence, corruption and administrative incompetence of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> government headed by <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, the general's third wife. Results may not be known until Aug. 10, when the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> discloses the tally of its 600 members. The inauguration wo n't be until Dec. 10, the final day of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s six-year term.

<HEAD>Settlement in Racial Bias Suit at McChord AFB</HEAD>

 A judge has tentatively approved a settlement of a decade-old class-action racial discrimination lawsuit filed by black civilian employees of <ORGANIZATION> McChord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said Friday that he found the settlement fair and reasonable, but the agreement wo n't be final before mid-August. About 125 current and former black employees who were denied promotions they sought or who were discouraged from applying are eligible to receive a total of $ 415,000 in back wages the government agreed to pay under the agreement. The suit included about 300 current and former black employees. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said payments should range between about $ 500 and $ 15,000. The settlement is designed to correct what black employees said was a system that fostered discrimination in promotions at the base. The federal government did not admit wrongdoing in the agreement. `` I'm very confident that the people in the civilian personnel office will make a legitimate effort to ensure that what occurred in the past does not occur in the future,'' said <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who has worked at <ORGANIZATION> McChord </ORGANIZATION> for 33 years and filed the original claim in 1979. `` If nobody ever complains, nothing ever changes,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The preliminary settlement provides for the promotions of 12 blacks to currently vacant supervisory positions or higher-paying positions that eventually could lead to supervisory posts. The promoted blacks also would participate in future promotion decisions at McChord. <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said he would n't comment on the settlement The federal government fought the case for more than 10 years, the first four in a fruitless effort to prevent the suit from being certified as a class action.

 Hunger activist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON>, after blasting the media for getting in the way of world understanding, urged the creation of a global broadcast university. `` It is essential that people be given access to information on matters that influence them,'' <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> told a gathering Saturday of international contributors to the `` CNN World Report,'' a production of <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON>, an Irish rock musician and composer, organized the Live Aid benefit concert that raised $ 72 million for African famine victims in 1985. That concert sparked similar efforts, including one announced Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to aid victims of the Dec. 7 earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has asked for his help in that eight-hour concert, scheduled for Aug. 12. Calling television `` a hindrance to understanding'' and `` the single worst anti-democratic force in the world today,'' <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> told the broadcasters the mass media concentrates on images, quick interviews and controversy at the expense of improving understanding. `` Controversy is not necessarily information,'' he said. `` Giving facts is not enough.'' He called on broadcasters to communicate directly to the people in rural areas of the Third World. <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> suggested distributing solar-powered radios to people in areas lacking electricity so they could tune in to the global university, which should offer `` recognized degrees.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Says Forces Behind Medicare Equalization Bill `Well-Marshaled</HEAD>

 Six years after deciding rural hospitals could live on less than their urban counterparts, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appears ready to revise the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payment schedule to give a financial boost to isolated hospitals. But finding money to bring rural hospitals to the same reimbursement level as their city counterparts will be tough in these days of tight budgets, says Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, sponsor of the Equity for Rural Hospitals Act. Moreover, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> cautions that no single bill will solve all of the problems of rural hospitals and federal health officials say Medicare can not be the sole source of a hospital's survival. `` For some hospitals, no matter what you do to the Medicare system, you would not save the hospital or have a significant impact,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, acting administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> is `` just one piece of the picture and there is nothing <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> can do to produce more patients for a hospital that has a 10 percent occupancy rate,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said. Although <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is concerned about ensuring access to health care in rural and inner city areas, the department has not yet taken a position on <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s bill, said spokesman <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said bringing rural hospitals to the same reimbursement levels as their urban counterparts would cost $ 700 million annually when fully phased in. His bill, cosponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and backed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, calls for phasing in a uniform Medicare reimbursement rate beginning in 1991. But Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, D-Iowa and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, warned the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could face a `` drastic price tag'' for rebuilding the rural health care system if quick action is not taken. `` I'll do what I can to accelerate it,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Friday in an interview. `` You have to find the money to accelerate it, that's the problem in these budget constraints I expect to get some money for it, but not as much as those rural hospitals would want in that first year.'' `` I'm optimistic about the chances for passing my rural hospital bill this year and I'm making it a high priority,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I have some 56 senators cosponsoring it. ... I've got my forces well marshaled.'' Numerous other bills have been introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to deal with the rural health care crisis, including legislation that seeks to impose a one-year moratorium on <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> cuts in reimbursements to rural hospitals. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> established the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> prospective payment system -LRB- PPS -RRB- in 1983, lawmakers assumed rural hospital cost would be lower than city hospitals. Under <ORGANIZATION> PPS </ORGANIZATION>, rural hospitals are reimbursed at least 12 percent less than urban hospitals by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> _ the government's health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. But lawmakers say that differential can no longer be justified: rural hospitals frequently pay higher labor costs because of the difficulty of attracting professionals to an isolated area, they are n't big enough to buy supplies in bulk, they are more dependent on Medicare patients than city hospitals, and the costs of indigent health have become a growing financial burden. Sen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., said the problems of rural hospitals also stem in part from the changing demographics and economic environment of rural communities `` The country as a whole is developing a two-track economy,'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The more prosperous one is centered in major cities on both coasts, and in stark contrast, the ` heartland' communities are in recession.''

 New <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> is 4 years old and an also-ran in the cola wars, but <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says there's plenty of fizz left in the beverage that helped revolutionize the marketing of soft drinks. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> was the world's most popular soft drink and more. The brand had become a symbol of the pervasive influence of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> power and culture around the globe. So it was no small decision when the company decided to reformulate the cola it had sold for 99 years. And it triggered no small reaction. The consumer backlash to the new drink was so strong that the company quickly brought back the original formula under the name Coca-Cola Classic. Four years later, what goes by the label of <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> is virtually ignored by consumers while Classic <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> reigns No. 1. But company officials say they have no plans to drop the new formula, and industry analysts say they're right. `` It's regarded as the absolute biggest marketing travesty ever hoisted on the American public. With God's help, everyone will have similar mistakes,'' said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, who publishes Beverage Digest in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The announcement of new <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> gave new birth to all Coca-Cola products and the entire soft drink industry,'' he said. The introduction of the new <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> heated up the `` cola wars,'' and saw companies step up their efforts to introduce new variations of their name-brand products to gain a greater share of the $ 45 billion soft-drink market. Now there is not only <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and Classic Coke, but diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, caffeine-free <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and even regular and diet <ORGANIZATION> Cherry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. Arch-rival <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> may regard the new <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> as a `` pretty nominal player,'' but it believes a company's full product line is more important than any single drink, said spokesman <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>. `` The parts make up the whole,'' <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said. Indeed, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> emphasizes that its entire line of soft drinks is strong and claims to hold a dominant 33.7 percent share of the retail market. The brand name with the new formula that for years was the best-seller had dropped to 10th place at the end of 1988, tied with RC Cola and caffeine-free Diet Pepsi. The new <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> had a mere 1.4 percent of the market, down from 1.6 percent in 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Classic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> _ the old <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> with the new name _ held the No. 1 position with 20.1 percent of the market. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> Cola was No. 2 with 18.7 percent. Even with its slim market share, the new <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> makes money and generates $ 675 million a year in revenue, said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, a spokesman at the company's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> had any other name on it, it would be perceived as a huge success,'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said. `` Because the can has ` Coca-Cola' on it, the expectations were huge.'' <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a soft drink industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said the new <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> still sold 4 billion cans last year, which makes it unlikely the company would drop it. `` There are people still drinking it,'' he said. `` If they take it away, they may go somewhere else.'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said taste tests continue to show consumers like new <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> better than <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>. Improving the taste was behind the decision to alter the formula, the company said when it announced the change in April 1985. The new <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> hit the stores on May 8 of that year, the 99th anniversary of the date the first Coca-Cola was sold. But notwithstanding test results, the backlash was swift and harsh from consumers who resented the removal of a drink they had enjoyed for generations. Two months later, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> apologized to the public and brought back the old formula as Classic Coke. `` There's no question it did n't work out as planned,'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said. Still, the bungling has n't tarnished the vaunted brand name, <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> asserts. `` In the public's mind, what they call <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> is what the company is <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> calls Coca-Cola Classic,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> on Sunday restated his view that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be cautious in reaching an arms accord with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> based simply on the apparent goodwill of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> needs to proceed cautiously, conservatively ... and make certain we are not dealing with a temporary aberration in Soviet behavior,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in an interview on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, addressing various aspects of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic policy, said the administration: _ Refuses to negotiate with the Soviets on the withdrawal of short-range nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, because it is first necessary to eliminate the 2-to-1 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> edge in conventional forces West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose party faces a tough election next year, has been urging <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to open such talks. _ Will encourage development of democratic governments in Soviet-controlled Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ Places great hope in the eventual development of Star Wars defenses, although it reduced the budget requested for the Strategic Defense Initiative from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal of $ 5.8 billion to $ 4.6 billion next year <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> sparked a debate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week by predicting that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms would fail and that he would be replaced by someone more hostile to the West. That observation, repeated three times over the course of a week, prompted President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to declare that they hoped <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms would succeed. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Sunday that he thought his remarks `` got overplayed.'' Even so, full details of the new administration policy toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> remained unclear. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was expected to disclose the administration's arms control stance this week during a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In a speech last week, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> echoed <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s cautious attitude, noting that `` the Soviets continue to pose a significant military threat to Western interests.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Sunday that `` the key emphasis on arms control in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ought to be on conventional force reductions _ that the Soviets retain an overwhelming conventional superiority.'' He ruled out talks on short-range nuclear missiles before the conclusion of ongoing conventional arms talks, in which both sides have proposed sharp cuts that would end Soviet-bloc numerical superiority in tanks and troops in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We do not foresee a set of circumstances in which you would have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops deployed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where you would not also have as a significant component of deterrence, nuclear weapons _ short-range nuclear forces. That's a fact of life,'' said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. In related developments, two leading Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the chief arms control aide to then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take a more flexible approach in negotiating with the Soviets. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., urged the administration to consider `` mandate talks'' with the Soviets to decide how to deal with the issue of short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., said he did not think `` we can sustain the position that we will not negotiate on the short-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> proposed that any reductions be linked to cuts in Soviet conventional forces. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s senior arms control adviser, said he did not see how the West German government could agree to the dual policy of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, urging modernization of the short-range Lance missile while refusing to enter talks with the Soviets on that class of weapons. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> both appeared on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> appeared on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show, `` Meet the Press.''

 As Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> begins her sixth month in office, she faces rising domestic opposition that is undermining her power in the four provinces. The squabbling has interfered with her push to implement a populist socio-economic program focused on local projects to improve health, education and public works. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, 35, was sworn in as prime minister Dec. 2 to become the first woman leader in the modern Moslem world. Her <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was popularly elected Nov. 16 in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first free election in more than a decade. She rode a wave of sympathy for her father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, deposed by Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> in 1977 and later executed on charges of conspiracy to murder a political opponent. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in a plane crash in August 1988. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s opponents have done a great deal to curb the sympathy wave since her election. She ranks a close second in popularity, after bipartisan President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, according to a recent Gallup Poll conducted among <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s urban dwellers. Nevertheless, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s nemesis is her opponents in the provincial governments, who either are challenging her leadership or deserting coalitions headed by her party, which she describes as a social democratic party. The <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, aided by smaller parties and independents, still controls the powerful <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, or lower house of parliament, but the provincial skirmishes already have limited her political and economic options. In <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the biggest and richest province and home to 56 percent of the population, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> mounted two major asssaults by moving a vote of no confidence against right-wing Chief Minister <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> in the provincial legislative assembly. Both attempts fell short of a majority. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> is the linchpin of the nationwide, eight-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> wants to do away with all of her opponents in order to create one-party rule in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' charged <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>. In volatile Sindh, the southern province the <ORGANIZATION> Bhuttos </ORGANIZATION> call home, Chief Minister <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Qaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> commands 84 of 114 votes in the legislative assembly. But after months of squabbling, a 28-member group called <ORGANIZATION> Mohajir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Qaumi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> consisting of Moslem immigrants from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> pulled out of the coalition May 1. `` <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> failed to protect the lives of immigrant students and -LRB- mohajir -RRB- population, which is facing violence by the local population in numerous cities,'' said <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON>, chief of the Moslem party. Newspaper reports say that mohajirs, fearing violence from native Sindhis, are deserting their villages and towns and migrating to major cities such as <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hyderabad </LOCATION>. The powerful and vocal mohajir movement can cause Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party plenty of trouble She is upset by recurrent violence in <LOCATION> Sindh </LOCATION>. `` There is a mini-insurgency,'' she said in a recent speech. It is like `` a crushed egg, which needs delicate handling to bring it into its original shape.'' Ethnic riots involving the mohajirs and other groups have left nearly 700 dead since 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s provincial coalition Cabinet in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frontier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> border collapsed on April 27 when the pro-Soviet Awami -LRB- People's -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> pulled out. Leaders of that party said she reneged on a promise to give them the provincial governorship in exchange for their role as a coalition partner. `` <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> failed to keep each one of her promises,'' said <PERSON> Nasim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a veteran women's leader of the party. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s provincial Chief Minister <PERSON> Aftab </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherpao </PERSON> still has support of 37 legislators _ the largest single bloc _ in a house of 86 after the 14-member <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> quit. However, opponents in Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party warn that the future loyalties of 10 of <PERSON> Sherpao </PERSON>'s supporters can waver. The southwestern province of <LOCATION> Baluchistan </LOCATION>, also bordering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, is in the hands of another group of <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> opponents, led by <PERSON> Nawab </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bugti </PERSON> is the provincial chief minister and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Baluchistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. He is supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> in addition to the right-wing Jamaat-e-Ulema-e-Islam -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The groups are peeved at Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s refusal to give <LOCATION> Baluchistan </LOCATION> a larger share of federal tax revenues and royalties on oil and natural gas produced in the province. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is facing a 12 percent annual inflation rate, compared to 5 percent last year. The prices of some essential goods have gone up 18 percent. A wage hike will push prices up further and enlarge the current $ 2.75 billion federal budget deficit. It equals about 6.7 percent of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s gross domestic product. The next national budget, due June 1, may fuel more inflation as independent economists fear more taxes across the board.

 The doghouse or the henhouse? Foghorn is a bit confused about home. The rooster has turned up his beak at the hens on <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s farm to share a large, turned-over barrel with a friendly, female mutt named Muffin. `` What we have here is a pretty unnatural situation,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Foghorn is a silky rooster rather than one of the more popular varieties of farm roosters, such as <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Red, she said. His feathers are unique _ `` more like hair,'' she said. `` Maybe that's why he thinks he belongs in the doghouse instead of the henhouse. Muffin, a medium-sized dog with German shepherd features, does n't seem to mind the company. The two are pals and sleep together in the barrel turned on its side that serves as Muffin's home Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> tried to confine the rooster with the hens after she was given Foghorn this spring, but he would n't have anything to do with his own kind and soon sought out the dog. `` He does n't seem to care a thing about the hens,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Muffin recently got away from her feathered companion long enough to mate with her own species. She's the mother of a new litter. `` When it comes to dogs, people will believe about anything, but they wo n't believe ... Muffin and Foghorn until they see it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` After they see it, they get a funny look on their face.''

 A mock electric chair, pastel placemats, art deco furniture and other props from the `` Miami Vice'' television series were bought up by fans who clamored for a piece of the show even before its final episode. `` It's better to sell everything, and everybody gets a little piece of the show,'' <PERSON> Cici </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, the show's location auditor, said Saturday. `` There's a lot of junk, but they're buying it.'' The final scenes for the hit series, which began in 1984 and made <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and pastel men's suits famous, were filmed April 27. The last episode, its plot a closely guarded secret, is due to be broadcast May 21. A cramped warehouse held what was left of props used in the 108 episodes of MTV-era detective show. People carted away voodoo statues, Santeria candles, Rolodexes and anything else they could carry. Hundreds of pink flamingos and briefcases, one riddled with bullet holes, were hot items. `` Everybody _ like madness _ went right to the flamingos,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>, the show's Emmy Award-winning set decorator. The items had been destined to be shipped to <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said it was better to sell the items to the people of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The money raised from the giant garage sale will be credited to the show, she said. `` People feel united _ that ` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice' was really a part of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> instead of just using <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, 45 of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. She dragged away a blanket stuffed with placemats, pillows and other items she will use to decorate her home. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> paid $ 100 for the gray, metal desk that was used in the show by <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tubbs </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The desk used by <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, was already sold. `` It's just an old, junky desk. ... I do n't need any new desks,'' <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said. `` We got it as a sentimental sort of thing.'' <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> VanDerMark </PERSON> carted away a box of stuff on an old red wheelchair. <PERSON> VanDerMark </PERSON>, 45 of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said he's never seen the show `` We're not buying it because of the show. We're buying it because it's good junk,'' he said, After five years, <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> said he felt odd watching the items he purchased for the show being sold. `` I got a little goose bumpy,'' <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> said. `` It was a good way to go out.''

<HEAD>Injuries Rising in Violent Crimes, Report Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The percentage of victims of rape, robbery and assault who were physically injured during the attack increased from 1979 to 1986, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> survey. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON>, the statistician who prepared the report issued Sunday, said that although violent crime rates dropped about 11 percent from 1973 to 1986, the number of injuries _ about 2.2 million a year _ did not. `` Since injuries have remained relatively constant over the period, a higher proportion of victims of violent crime today are injured,'' she said. The report covered only rape, robbery and assault for people at least 12 years old. It did not cover murder, manslaughter and child abuse. The report was based on findings of the National Crime Survey, which questioned an average of 116,000 respondents in 55,000 households in each year of the survey. The results include crimes not reported to police. Because of the large percentage of people questioned each year compared with the total number of crime victims, the results are not subject to the margin of error limitations of a smaller poll. Over the years 1979-1986, a total of about 63 million people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were victims of rape, robbery or assault, of whom 17.7 million were injured, the report concluded. Of the average 2.2 million people hurt each year, 357,830 suffered serious injury and 1.83 million suffered minor injury. About 1 percent or almost 23,000 people suffered gunshot wounds, about 77,000 had knife wounds, 141,500 suffered broken bones or teeth, 64,000 had internal injuries and 84,000 lost consciousness, according to the report. The percentage of victims who were injured during the attack was 27.5 percent in 1973 and remained relatively constant except for a drop to 26.9 percent in 1982 before climbing the next few years to 30.3 percent in 1986, Ms. <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON> said in an interview, citing figures not included in the report, which covered only 1979-86. The actual rate of violent crime, that is, the number of victims of rape, robbery or assault per 1,000 people, decreased substantially in the last few years of the survey, she said. The highest rate since 1973 was in 1981, when 45.6 per 1,000 were victims of such crimes. That number dropped to 36.7 per 1,000 in 1986, but preliminary figures for 1987 and 1988 indicate the rate has increased again, Ms. <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the injury rate _ the number of people per 1,000 who suffered injuries as victims of those violent crimes _ stayed relatively stable. In 1973, the rate was 11.4 per 1,000. It rose to a high of 12.7 in 1981 and then dropped to 11.1 in 1986, she said. Neither Ms. <PERSON> Harlow </PERSON> nor the report she compiled gave reasons for the 1981 spike in crime and injury rates. While almost half of the injured victims received some medical care, including almost a fourth being treated in an emergency room or hospital, one in 25, a total of about 87,650 people, needed to stay overnight in the hospital, the report found. Those most likely to suffer injuries were men, blacks, people age 19 to 24, people with at most a high school education, those who were separated or divorced, poor people with family incomes under $ 10,000 a year and residents of central cities. Those least likely to be injured were women, whites, widows, those 50 or older, people with family incomes of $ 30,000 or more, those who had attended college for a year or more and those who lived outside metropolitan areas.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> property owners, who won a court battle over control of access to the mile-long stretch of sandy shore, reacted angrily Sunday as town officials proposed that the beach be reopened to the public anyway. `` I object to allowing hordes of people to come onto my property,'' landowner <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Galt </PERSON> said at a special meeting called by Town Manager <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` This is private land. Every one of us knows that.'' Even though the town of <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> and the state attorney general's office were the losers in late March when the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the property owners can bar the public from the beach, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told landowners Sunday that the town would agree to maintain the beach if it could be opened to the public `` The town will comply with the court decision,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` In the short term, we want to see ... if the property owners would consider opening it up for the summer, the summer of 1989.'' The town is seeking an appraisal of the beach to consider taking it through eminent domain, and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> found no enthusiasm for his proposal to keep the beach public in the meantime. `` I do n't feel that you people considered that these are individual pieces of land,'' property owner <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We are not operating as a country club group or a condominium group. I may decide on Tuesday I'll let everybody there. On Wednesday, I may get up grumpy and say, ` Nobody.' I intend to keep that right.'' <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> shore is rare in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, making up just 35 miles of the 3,500-mile meandering coastline, which is mostly rocky. The divided supreme court ruled in March that the only public access right to the beach was granted in a 17th century colonial ordinance that permits access for fishing, bird hunting and boating. Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> owners complained that for years, thousands of tourists have come to the beach without respecting their property. The landowners asked town selectmen Sunday whether it would be possible to stop local motels and campgrounds from bringing in tourists on buses, but Town Attorney <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> said there would be constitutional problems with such a ban. After the landowners made it clear they would not consider opening the beach to the public, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said that the town will abide by the court ruling. But he has said it will be difficult to keep tourists away.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Syrian and Christian gunners blasted residential districts of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sunday in savage artillery duels that killed at least 20 people as the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> moved quickly to try to revive a collapsed truce. A police spokesman said 100 people were wounded in a seven-hour bombardment that left the streets blanketed with debris. The spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said about 20,000 shells and rockets were unleashed on the divided capital and surrounding areas. Fires burned out of control in both Moslem and Christian sectors. Hundreds of charred cars smoldered in parking lots, and severed power cables dangled from twisted poles or shell-pocked apartment buildings. `` Almost every district, every street and every alley is shelled. The capital looks like it has been struck by a killer earthquake,'' the spokesman said. Blazing pine trees lit up the night sky as Christian artillery positions began the exchange by firing 155mm howitzers at Syrian and Druse positions across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and neighboring hills. The Syrians responded with rocket fire at <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the city's port, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> harbors of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Byblos </PERSON>, and a cluster of deserted summer resorts in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central mountains. The deaths and woundings increased the overall toll to 298 killed and 1,111 wounded since the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war broke out March 8. The fighting pits army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian soldiers against an alliance of Syrian troops and 7,000 militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Christians resumed shelling Saturday night after nine days of unanswered Syrian attacks on the Christian sector's coast. Those attacks were in defiance of an April 28 cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British and French ambassadors on Saturday night that he would respond to the Syrian fire, a spokesman for his headquarters said. An hour later, the Christian firing began. The Syrians and their allies have said they will keep shelling until the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> dispatches a multinational 321-man observer force to monitor the truce. They want the observer force in place to prevent arms from reaching <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces. But the current escalation threatened to block the arrival of the observer force under the command of Kuwaiti Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Momen </PERSON>. It will be drawn from the armies of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. Arab League Secretary-General <PERSON> Chedli </PERSON> <PERSON> Klibi </PERSON> sent fresh appeals Sunday to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and to acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> to `` spare no effort to restore the cease-fire and enable the observers to deploy within the next few days.'' <PERSON> Klibi </PERSON> also immediately dispatched his deputy, <PERSON> Kakhadar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, back to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to resume his peacemaking mission, sources at the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> headquarters said. A mediation panel set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in January has made four cease-fire calls. All have collapsed, although the league had promised this last one would be different because it would be monitored by the observer force. When the shelling slackened at dawn, tens of thousands of dazed residents emerged from underground bunkers to assess damage, buy food and water, and hurry back to the shelters. `` The executioners of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> are going to resume their moronic bombardment,'' said <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> Taleb </PERSON>, a Moslem housewife holding her 2-month-old baby and carrying a supply of of powdered milk. Among those inspecting the damage was <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a mostly Moslem Cabinet competing with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. `` No words are enough to describe this horror,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> told reporters as he toured the battered two-story prime ministry. `` I repeat my plea for a total cessation of hostilities out of mercy for the innocent population.'' One shell devastated Defense Minister <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON>'s office in the prime ministry building in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s commercial <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> district. The latest fighting erupted after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, in a bid to reassert state authority, clamped a blockade on three illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north of the capital. The Syrians later joined the fighting. The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops across almost 70 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> lost their credibility as neutral peacekeepers by siding with the Moslems. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s rival governments emerged in September when outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to rule pending <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s election of a new head of state Moslems and leftists rejected the appointment.

<HEAD>Bush's Explanation of Iran-Contra Role Unsatisfactory, Congressman
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that investigated the Iran-Contra scandal on Sunday labeled as unsatisfactory President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s explanation of his role in an arrangement to provide the Nicaraguan rebels with aid. `` I'm not satisfied with his answers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind. `` I think we need to know a lot more about ... then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s activities.'' On Thursday, the same day a jury returned its verdict in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` there was no quid pro quo'' arrangement discussed in his meeting in early 1985 with Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>. Documents introduced during <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial indicated that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved a deal in 1985 in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and economic aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would be expedited in return for <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> aid to the Contras. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras, who were camped just inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' cited past White House denials of arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> involvement in supplying the Contras with aid _ allegations that later proved to be true. `` I'm skeptical,'' he said, regarding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s denial Thursday of talking with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> about any arrangement to indirectly funnel aid to the Contras. `` That's the whole story of Iran-Contra, I think. I'm bound to be skeptical of what the executive branch has said to me.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said the documents in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial `` show that we contacted <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, we increased aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, in return, aided the Contras.'' `` Those documents are about as clear a statement of quid pro quo as you will ever see ...'' he said. `` They are contrary to what the president says; we ought to pursue them.'' However, there is no immediate need to recovene the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra committees, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. The next step, he said, is for the intelligence panels of both bodies to obtain the documents and examine them. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called new efforts to link <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the Iran-Contra affair `` a bad mistake, not only in terms of foreign policy, but just in terms of general public policy in this country. `` Throughout the entire period of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, we were giving a lot of assistance to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` And we did so simply because they were very helpful to our foriegn policy and the prosecution of what we were doing in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The relief plane executed a corkscrew dive in case of missile attack, leveled off and landed in <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, a once-bustling southern town transformed by civil war and fa mine into a dusty rebel outpost. Shoeless young men, wearing only tattered shorts and glistening with sweat, unloaded the 14 tons of maize. It was the plane's second delivery of the day Under the shade of a mango tree beyond a ridge of earthen fortifications, rebels in army fatigues and civilians in ragged clothing relaxed and watched what has become a regular exercise. The airlift is part of a program coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to save 100,000 southern Sudanese from starvation by stocking food throughout the region before the annual rains, which begin this month and will make roads and airstrips unusable. Operation Lifeline-Sudan, begun April 1 and expected to cost $ 132 million, is intended to prevent a repeat of last year's disaster The director of the operation said Sunday that it was well behind schedule but `` virtually certain'' to stave off massive starvation. `` The back of the disaster has been broken,'' the director, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, told a <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> news conference. He said about 45,000 tons of food and supplies has been moved into southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and another 50,000 tons is expected to be moved into the region by the end of June. The operation's deadline was pushed back a month due to the delays and will continue to deliver food into southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> through the rainy season, said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. Deliveries could not begin until the government and rebels agreed to suspend fighting along specified `` corridors of tranquility'' along which the food and other supplies could move. Aid is being sent to both rebel-held areas and those controlled by the army. A monthlong truce followed the initial agreement, but the original goal of stockpiling 170,000 tons of supplies in the south still is unlikely to be achieved. Relief officials say as many as 500,000 people died of drought, flood and famine exacerbated by the 6-year-old war between the army and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> led by former Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>. Most southern Sudanese are black, predominantly Christian or animist. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> and his rebel army are fighting for autonomy and a better economic deal from the government in the Arab, Moslem north. No one knows for sure how many of <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>'s 30,000 people perished before rebel fighters drove out the last soldiers in February, ending a yearlong siege of this river town ringed by the jagged <LOCATION> Imatong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate up to 1,000 died each month. Rebels found fewer than 1,000 civilians remaining in the town's huts of mud and thatch, relief officials said The rest had died or fled into the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> to escape the war and to forage for food. Residents who stayed or have returned since February say they were denied any of the supplies government soldiers received through army airdrops and survived on mangoes and a clover-like weed the local <LOCATION> Latuga </LOCATION> tribe calls ogasik. <PERSON> Laudina </PERSON> <PERSON> Legga </PERSON>, 28, said 15 members of her family starved to death before she, her mother and her two children fled to the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> early this year. `` We ate only ogasik for nine months,'' she said in a conversation on a dirt road. Ms. <PERSON> Legga </PERSON> was returning home from the relief plane with a basket of maize balanced on her head. She and the others returned to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> at the end of April, lured by the new security and growing stocks of food. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says about 20,000 people have come back to the town and surrounding area since the rebels took control. Many huts still appeared empty during a tour of the town. People interviewed seemed in good health and relatively well-fed. <PERSON> Olaug </PERSON> <PERSON> Husby </PERSON>, one of three Norwegian Church Aid health workers based in <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, said the apparent lack of hunger was partly due to resumed harvesting of food from the countryside. Other relief officials said the people may not have been as desperate this year as had been thought. Whatever the explanation, `` they are not starving now,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative coordinating storage in <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>. He said some of the relief food had been distributed but most would be stockpiled for the rainy season, when floods normally isolate <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> until November. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials expect the town's population to reach 50,000, with the influx of refugees, and plan to stock 8,000 tons of food. <PERSON> Martinson </PERSON> said about a quarter of that had been delivered by May 1, two weeks after airlifts and road convoys started moving from <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. Convoys from <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> were suspended May 1, three days after the second attack along the road. Eight rebel escorts were killed April 18, when a missile destroyed the lead vehicle in the first attack on a relief convoy. <PERSON> Martinson </PERSON> said he suspected the raids were carried out by tribesmen in the area or by Ugandan insurgents who had filtered into southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Voters in lines that snaked across an empty lot Sunday were not discouraged by a hot tropical sun as they waited patiently to cast their ballots in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s second presidential election in 21 years. Some brought parasols or even chairs for the wait. Others turned out before dawn, two hours before polls opened at 7 a.m., while still others just sweated in the sun. `` Everybody votes in the morning, then goes home to wait,'' said <PERSON> Nellida </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON>, an opposition party pollwatcher. Voting was slowed by late-opening polls, careful checks of booths by pollwatchers and the somewhat cumbersome process of casting ballots. But voters remained in the long lines. Election officials sat at a rough wooden table with party pollwatchers arrayed behind them at ballot box 2742, inside one of seven sheds placed on a dusty lot in downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Voters stepped up to the bench and proferred their identity cards, which were checked and punched. A man whose ID card did not quite match the registration list was allowed to cast his ballot after a quick discussion among poll officials and pollwatchers. `` We all know each other here,'' said one official. `` The instructions say to assume minor problems are just mistakes or typos.'' The turnout at 2742, as at others throughout the nation, was extremely heavy. By 8 a.m. more than 100 of the 348 people assigned to the station were in line, but only 20 people had voted. `` I've been on line an hour and it looks like I have another hour to wait,'' said <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynaud </PERSON>, his skin shiny with sweat. `` But I'm going to vote.'' At one voting station, acting president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was greeted with a mixture of boos and cheers. Opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> appeared at another polling booth and was greeted by a joyous, chanting crowd. It was a calm Sunday, and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s streets were almost entirely empty. No liquor sales were permitted between noon Saturday and midnight Sunday. U.S.-style ballots are not used in the voting process in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Voters are given an empty envelope when they enter a booth. Inside are stacks of colored cards for each candidate. A voter puts the cards of the candidates he supports into the envelope, then deposits the envelope into a cardboard urn. Loud cheers broke out when a woman who had taken fully five minutes to complete the process finally emerged. Poll officials brought forward the elderly and the handicapped, saying they did not have to wait in line. Complaints were minor. Voters at one booth said they tried to disguise their motions as they selected their cards because the curtain was too short and allowed officials to see inside. Pollwatchers at box 2742 complained that the booth's light bulb had been stolen, which would complicate the initial count after polls close at 5 p.m. `` I'll get a flashlight,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, another opposition pollwatcher. `` No, I'll have my father bring a light bulb from home,'' said <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON>.

 Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> on Sunday indirectly endorsed as his successor <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who has urged a terror campaign against Westerners to avenge the deaths of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied lands. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> also backed constitutional reforms that are expected to give the president more executive power, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as telling worshipers in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, `` Fortunately, the people's attention has naturally been drawn to one of the most prominent faces of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> by name but made an obvious reference to him, saying: `` The candidate that some groups have identified for the presidency revives this hope in us that, God willing, our nation will have a much brighter future.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 54, one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s most prominent political personalities, is the only declared candidate so far in presidential elections scheduled for late summer. Two influential clerical groups, one composed of hardliners and the other of liberal theologians, have said they will back the parliament speaker. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, a longtime political ally of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, made the endorsement during a sermon to mark the Eid al-Fitr feast that ends the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. `` God willing, this year the matter of the presidency will be good news for our people,'' he said. Under the 1980 constitution, the 50-year-old president can not run for a third four-year term. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who also serves as acting commander of the armed forces, earned a reputation as a moderate through his support for rebuilding ties with Western nations. He hoped to speed reconstruction of the country after the eight-year-long <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, halted by a U.N.-mediated cease-fire on Aug. 20. But he recently changed tack, supporting <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomenei </PERSON>'s Feb. 14 call for the death of British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. And in an inflammatory speech broadcast Friday, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said five American, French or British citizens should be killed in retaliation for each Arab slain in the uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He urged Palestinians to hijack planes or blow up factories in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> countries in order to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to release prisoners. Last month, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> backed a decision by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to amend the constitution and said he hoped the reforms would give the next president more power. Executive power is divided between <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has the last word in decision-making as the country's spiritual leader. But the prime minister holds more authority than the president, and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> has said that must be rectified if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is to have a strong government. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> appointed a 20-man committee to revise the constitution, which must then be approved by the people in a referendum. Both <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> are committee members. Analysts have speculated the committee may suggest the prime minister's job be abolished altogether. In his sermon, <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> was quoted as saying a stronger presidency and constitutional reforms would allow `` greater room for realizing the nation's potential.'' Also Sunday, the president opened the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> International Book Fair with an attack on the West for supporting <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book `` The Satanic Verses,'' the official news agency reported. `` We can see how colonialist hands are supporting a writer and publishers who have insulted the sanctities of 1 billion Moslems,'' the agency quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as saying. The book prompted worldwide protests by Moslems, who view it as blasphemous. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for his death. The news agency said despite a boycott by some Western publishers, 237 foreign publishers and 270 local companies are participating in the 12-day fair.

 The body of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> paratrooper sergeant who was missing since Feb. 16 was found Sunday buried near the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and Israeli officials accused <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas of killing him. Hundreds of angry Israelis gathered outside the victim's home in the port city of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>, shouting `` Death to the Arabs!'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said some Israelis attacked an Arab laborer at a nearby grocery store. It said police rescued the Arab and sealed off the area. Also Sunday, Arab hospital officials said 15 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers, despite widespread curfews ordering 450,000 Palestinians to stay in their homes. Twelve of the wounded were shot in clashes in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and three refugee camps, the hospital officials said. They said at least three were shot in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The army said it had no reports of woundings. The slain soldier, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON>, 21, disappeared after leaving his southern base for his home. He was last seen hitchhiking at a junction about 10 miles from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt it's homicide. Preliminary findings show he was shot,'' an army spokesman said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, however, said a knife was found near the body. The radio said <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON> was found when private investigators who were searching for stolen cars in a helicopter landed and spotted a hand sticking out of the ground. The army, backed by police and volunteers, had searched extensively for <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON> since his disappearance. At one point, the search covered 200 square miles and involved 22,500 people. Late in February, a caller claiming to represent the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a previously unknown group, told the <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> news agency and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the group was holding <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON>. It demanded the release of 1,500 Palestinians. Meanwhile, some 1,300 soldiers carried out a massive search in the area north of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> for another <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier believed kidnapped. The soldier, <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON>, 18, was last seen Wednesday getting into a white car driven by men wearing skullcaps of observant Jews. `` We do n't know if there is a link, whether this -LRB- was done by -RRB- the same guerrilla group,'' Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` So far, he is missing.'' `` This disguise, passing off as religious people, we are familiar with this technique,'' he added. <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON>'s tearful mother said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> that `` This boy is my soul ... I'm only asking God to let him come back in peace.'' <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON>'s death raised to 21 the number of Israelis killed in the 17-month Arab uprising, along with 465 Palestinians. The army said Sunday its investigation of Saturday's clashes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> showed two Palestinians were killed and 77 wounded as soldiers opened fire to quell protests on Eid Al-Fitr, a major Moslem holiday. Arab hospital officials reported three killed and 135 injured in the Saturday violence. The toll of wounded was the highest in a single day in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> since the start of the uprising. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, Chief Military Spokesman Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON> defended the army against Palestinians' charges that the presence of soldiers outside a mosque in the Nusseirat refugee camp provoked the clashes Saturday. `` The local people in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> ... searched for confrontation with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers.'' According to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports, the trouble Saturday began as Moslems leaving morning prayers found about 100 soldiers waiting outside the mosque. Stone-throwing started and the troops opened fire. Also in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, Jewish settlers announced they founded a new settlement near <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION> where five Palestinians were killed last month in one of the worst confrontations with Israeli forces in the uprising. More than 70,000 Israelis already live in about 130 settlements among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has called the settlements an obstacle to peace.

 Officials at a concert arena got an order seizing <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s private jet Sunday to cover expenses of a brief, profanity-filled appearance in which the country music star failed to finish a single song. But a spokesman for the singer said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 39, was sorry about Saturday night's concert at the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centroplex </LOCATION> and would put everything right. After the concert ended, a few among the 7,000 concert-goers threw bottles and tried to burn souvenir T-shirts, said police, but there were no injuries or arrests reported. Damage to the building was described as minor. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, director of the 11,000-seat arena, said the singer `` would do three or four bars ... and then use some profanity and say ` We do n't need this song,' and then immediately sing something else.'' After about 20 minutes during which he talked incoherently and attempted several songs, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> threw his fiddle into the air and stumbled offstage, helped by members of his entourage, witnesses said. Fans had been told by a member of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> entourage that they could get their money back at the box office, but the box office did n't have that kind of cash on hand, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` The folks were aggravated,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogillio </PERSON>. `` We understood it. All we tried to do was try contain them from damaging anybody or anything. I think we were successful to some extent.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was voted Academy of Country Music entertainer of the year three times, was apologetic and promised to pay for ticket refunds, other expenses and any profit the arena would have made, spokesman <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Arwood </PERSON> said Sunday. Arwood, interviewed by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, said the incident was caused by a personal problem he would not disclose, and bore no relationship to the incident last month in which <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> stormed offstage 40 minutes into a concert in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arwood </PERSON> said several times that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is not an alcoholic and that a problem he had acknowledge having with pills is a thing of the past His father, the famous country singer-songwriter <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, died in 1953 at age 29 of the effects of alcohol abuse.

 Less than five months after she gave birth while in a coma, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> has composed a poem and is learning to eat, dress and groom herself. In a meeting with reporters Saturday outside the family's rented home, the 24-year-old woman said little more than `` hi,'' sitting in a wheelchair with her eyes fixed on her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>. He said she composed the following poem to him on a computer keyboard: `` I know in my heart what is wrong, what is right `` I know in my heart our love is worth the fight `` So hold on to me, babe, hold me tight, hold me fast, `` I know in my heart our love is going to last.'' As he sat beside his wife, <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> gave a bottle to their son, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> by Caesarean section Dec. 9, five months after Mrs. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> was injured in an automobile accident. She was the fourth woman in recorded medical history to carry a healthy fetus to term while in a coma. Mrs. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> was three months pregnant when the vehicle in which she was riding collided with another vehicle June 30, injuring nerves between her brain and the spinal cord. Her cousin, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, was killed. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, who was wearing a seat belt, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, then 13 months and strapped into a car seat, escaped injury. Doctors had held out little hope that Mrs. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> would recover, but she began to regain consciousness after her son was born. Since Feb. 14 she has spent most of her time in rehabilitation therapy at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, visiting her family at home on weekends. A statement issued by hospital officials said she had learned to eat, was learning to drink liquids and was trying to become mobile enough to get into and out of bed, dress and groom herself and perform other functions. She is able to stand only with assistance. Now that she has mastered the use of a keyboard, the next step is learning to use a device that translates typed messages into human speech. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> said he returned to work a month ago after using up sick leave and vacation time donated by co-workers at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, where he and his wife worked before the accident. `` I've learned a lot more about responsibility,'' he said. The other driver, <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Stackhouse </PERSON>, who was slightly injured, was convicted of vehicular assault and sentenced to three years in prison. Testimony indicated his blood alcohol content after the accident was more than twice the legal threshhold for driving while intoxicated.

 Assassins shot to death a legislator from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, officials said Sunday. It was the second such slaying in nine days. <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormeno </PERSON>, of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was shot by two men Saturday night in <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a slum on <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s outskirts, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> said There was no word on who might have carried out the killing. According to the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cronica </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormeno </PERSON> was in his car in front of a pharmacy and was ordered out by the gunmen. The attackers opened fire when the official tried to resist, and they fled in <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormeno </PERSON>'s vehicle, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronica </PERSON> said. On April 27, congressional deputy <PERSON> Eriberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON> of the Marxist coalition the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> was killed. Police blamed that slaying on the Mao-inspired <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, but some <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> officials blamed the anti-rebel death squad the <ORGANIZATION> Rodrigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>.

The Shining Path has assassinated scores of politicians during its nine-year fight to impose Marxist rule.

The Franco Command surfaced a year ago, vowing to kill leftist guerrillas and their supporters. Opposition charges that the <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> is linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have been denied by government officials.

 Authorities who fear more ethnic strife took a conciliatory tone with Armenian protesters Sunday, dispersing several thousand of them with a pledge to allow a rally later this week, a local journalist said. Gen. Maj. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Surkhov </PERSON> of the local military district confronted the protesters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, according to an editor with Armenpress, the republic's official news agency. He persuaded the crowd to break up by assuring them a legal demonstration could be held on Thursday, the journalist said. The editor, who spoke in a telephone interview on condition of anonymity, said the protesters were demanding freedom for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who have been jailed since December. The group led calls last year for the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, an Armenian-dominated region of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The dispute between the two southwestern republics led to the deaths of more than 90 people in ethnic violence last year. The Kremlin placed the disputed region under its own control. A new round of ethnic protests broke out last week. Local activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, also speaking by telephone, reported strikes by students outside the university and other schools in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> authorities arrested <PERSON> Movzes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogkesian </PERSON>, editor of the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION>, for an unknown reason. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> also said a general strike was continuing in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> itself to back demands that the mountainous enclave be put under Armenian control. <PERSON> Valeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidorov </PERSON>, speaking for the Kremlin-appointed commission now governing the disputed region, said the strikers' demands had been forwarded to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. However, he said local authorities were less worried about the strikes than about preventing a new outbreak of ethnic violence. `` The situation has to be closely watched'' because the atmosphere is so tense, he said. Several days ago, authorities took a harsher tone, warning they would use `` all available means'' to prevent more unrest.

 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> rivers cleared their banks Sunday, flooding part of downtown <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, in the aftermath of weekend storms that killed at least 23 people throughout the South. Damage estimates from the storms rose into the tens of millions of dollars, and while some people went to church to give thanks for survival, others found their churches were barely standing. `` I do n't know what we'll do. I do n't know if there's enough left to repair,'' J.T. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Farmington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> board of deacons, said as he looked at the tattered remains of his church in <LOCATION> Davie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The steeple of the small church, built in 1878, was torn from the roof during a tornado Friday night and crashed into a vacant house next door. Part of the roof went with the steeple as it splintered. The twister was part of a strong storm system that swept across the South on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Altogether, seven people were confirmed dead from floods or storms in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, five in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, five in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. More than 100 people were injured. In the most recently reported fatality, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state police on Sunday recovered the body of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 26, who was swept down the <LOCATION> Levisa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Buchanan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after an accident Friday night. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> rose to 5 feet above flood stage Sunday afternoon, and several streets on the eastern edge of downtown <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> were closed by flooding. In the yards of two riverfront cement companies, the tops of phone booths and overturned garbage containers poked out from swirling brown water. Officials said they did not expect the water to reach low-lying areas of the city's business district. The <LOCATION> Rivianna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Palmyra </LOCATION> crested about 10 feet above flood levels Saturday, and the <LOCATION> Appomattox </LOCATION> rose slightly above flood levels Sunday morning. The worst twister damage occurred in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> on Friday. In <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on Sunday, members of <ORGANIZATION> Ebenezer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> held worship services in a nearby recreation center after the storm left gaping holes in the roof and walls of their sanctuary. `` The destruction has happened _ we ca n't do anything about that,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>. He said the storm struck just 90 minutes after the church day care program had closed for the weekend. `` I feel they were very fortunate not to have had anything scheduled there at that time,'' <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON> said. `` You do n't need luck when you have the Lord.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where some of the most severe damage was reported. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he requested federal assistance earlier Sunday, and that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed to send assessment teams to determine what kind of aid the state is eligible for. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditt </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said damage across the state exceeded $ 28 million, while other estimates ranged far higher. About 74,000 <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers were still without power Sunday morning as weary workers tried to repair lines that had been torn to pieces in some places by winds gusting to 100 mph. <PERSON> Ditt </PERSON> said teams in 17 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties had reported 124 homes destroyed, 171 seriously damaged and 671 that received some damage. The storms also destroyed 42 businesses and seriously damaged 11 more, damaged 51 schools and churches and damaged or destroyed 79 farm buildings across the state. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> toured the stricken area in his state by helicopter Saturday and said he expects to ask for federal disaster relief assistance. In hard-hit <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman for the county Emergency Preparedness Division estimated damage at about $ 1.5 million. The losses include 25 houses and 13 mobile homes, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the estimate included only damage to buildings, not crop damage, damage to personal property or cleanup costs. Those estimates are still being prepared, she said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcers expressed relief Sunday that four suspected members of a drug-smuggling cult that killed 15 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They committed the crimes in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent in this border city at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' southern tip. `` If they commited murder in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, we ca n't charge them here.'' Cult leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, and a follower, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, were killed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, authorities said after a shootout there. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> college honor student described as the `` godmother'' or `` witch'' of the cult, was arrested at the same <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> residence with four others suspected of belonging to the murderous drug ring. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, 24, said in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday that <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> ordered himself and his right-hand man, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, killed when police closed in. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> agreed that it was best that Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and the others were arrested in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It's great,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. `` It will save us from having to extradite them'' -LRB- to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -RRB-. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> were among 11 people indicted by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand jury in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> on drug charges in the case. `` The only reason we were looking for them was so we could extradite them to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> so they could be tried there,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. `` The only purpose of the drug indictments here was to have probable cause to pick them up and turn them over to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' The task force that handled the case included the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cameron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said he did not expect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to try to extradite those in custody in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I hope they stay over there in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, because that's where the murders were coordinated and they have to stand trial over there,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. Under Mexican law, the worst punishment any of the suspects could receive is 50 years in prison. <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials last month located 15 bodies at or near a ranch west of the border city of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The dead, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college student, are believed to be the victims of a cult that performed human sacrifices and mutilations to bring magical protection to drug smuggling. Five men arrested the week the bodies were exhumed have been indicted on Mexican federal charges, including first-degree murder, kidnapping, illegal burial, weapons and drug violations and cover-up. Of the 11 indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, two are dead, one was in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody and six were in Mexican custody Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Sunday told thousands of cheering supporters to take a first step toward a free <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by electing union-backed candidates to Parliament next month. After Mass at the Plock cathedral, about 5,000 people walked down a grassy hill to an open amphitheater overlooking the <LOCATION> Vistula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. There, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> introduced the union's five candidates to represent the region in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> emphasized his roots in the rural central Polish region, a three-hour drive from his current home in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. He was born in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Popowo </LOCATION> and told the crowd he had been baptized in Plock. He urged voters to take advantage of new reforms that allow limited opposition participation in the June 4 legislative elections for the first time in the history of Communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` If we stand aside ... someone else will shape this <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for us again. So I appeal to you, let's build <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> together,'' he said. `` Our representatives at the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can create a platform from which we will jump into freedom and independence. If we do n't do that, our chance to have influenced decisions will be much smaller,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. The Solidarity-led opposition agreed to participate in elections as part of broad accords reached with authorities April 5. The agreement resulted in the legalization of the trade union movement after a seven-year ban. It also resulted in the creation of a new legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and more-open elections for the existing parliament, the Sejm. Independent candidates can run for 161 seats of the 460-member <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, in which a Communist-led alliance is still guaranteed a majority. All seats are open to any candidates in the new 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first freely elected legislative body. The two chambers form the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Stomma </PERSON>, an 81-year-old <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> lawyer and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with Solidarity's endorsement, thanked the crowd for the privilege of running from their town and said he would spend more time there if he were elected The law does not require candidates to live in the areas they seek to represent. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s close adviser, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Celinski </PERSON>, a 39-year-old <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> sociologist and candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, told the crowd: `` It will depend on us just how much freedom and justice and Solidarity there will be in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' Three other Solidarity candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> also made short speeches. While union supporters in Plock welcomed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> warmly, he drew some disapproving glances when he drove up to the bishop's residence in a shiny blue Mercedes `` Do n't worry, it's borrowed,'' he said. `` Good thing,'' quipped a woman in the crowd. The opposition rally came during a three-day miners' strike that has stopped nearly all copper mining in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Negotiators resumed talks Sunday in an effort to find a compromise in the dispute, according to <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. It gave no details, however. The strike, involving about 20,000 workers, is the country's first major bout of labor unrest since the opposition and government reached their accords last month The strike broke out at four mines near the city of <LOCATION> Lubin </LOCATION>, about 200 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The mines represent nearly all of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s copper production, which is an important source of hard-currency earnings. Miners are demanding a 50 percent pay increase, according to <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON>, a local Solidarity activist. They now earn $ 118-176 a month.

 Airline passengers who survived a crash-landing in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> kept calm as they waited overnight for rescuers to cut their way through dense jungle, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Sunday. `` They did everything they could to help each other and to help themselves,'' said <PERSON> Gennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular representative who was working with crash victims. The Aerocozumel flight carrying 18 people, mostly Americans, crash-landed at about 2:30 p.m. Friday in a remote area about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>. Authorities blamed engine failure for the crash. Six people, all American tourists, were killed and 10 people were injured. Fifteen of the 16 tourists aboard were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and one was a Canadian. The airline identified the dead as <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Canby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>; <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>. All the dead were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, and only the hometown and age of Ms. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> were available. A Mexican navy helicopter Saturday ferried the last survivor to a <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> hospital nearly 24 hours after the accident. `` They're in shock,'' said <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>. `` But I do n't have anybody who is not handling it. It's impressive. It was a serious emergency.'' The most badly injured was a man with a broken hip, said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, a representative for Aerocozumel. Three people were released on Saturday after undergoing brief observation, <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON> said it took two hours for rescue aircraft to spot the downed Tilatus Trislander, a British-made, triple-engine aircraft, after a passing commercial jetliner had picked up the plane's distress signal. Scores of rescue workers, assisted by local residents familiar with the jungle turf, hacked a trail with machetes to the downed plane Friday afternoon. They worked throughout the night and finally reached the plane at about 8:30 a.m. Saturday. Rescuers cleared a site just big enough to allow a navy helicopter to land. It began ferrying out the dead and wounded at mid-morning. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said she did n't think a faster rescue would have saved lives. `` What I've heard is that most of those who died died instantly,'' she said. The Aerocozumel flight was returning to the resort island of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> after taking the tourists to view ancient Indian ruins at <LOCATION> Chichen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Itza </LOCATION>, 115 miles west of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>. It crashed about two miles outside the <LOCATION> Playa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmen </LOCATION> airport, or about 125 miles northeast of Chichen Itza. <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON> said Capt. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Corso </PERSON>, 34, made the landing after two of the three engines apparently failed.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s top environmental official testified Sunday that a `` reluctant and myopic'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stalled efforts to clean up the nation's largest oil spill by largely ignoring damage outside the immediate spill zone. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, commissioner of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, told a congressional panel the spill has caused `` 550 miles of oil, filthy foam and tar balls.'' He said that on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, it would be the equivalent of oil washing up on beaches from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> south to the mouth of <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and possibly to the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` The industry's response was reluctant and myopic, chacterized by stalling techniques, disinformation, and a refusal to pay real attention to damage outside of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> told the five-member subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The congressional panel planned two days of hearings in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, with testimony scheduled from state, federal and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials. In another development Sunday, a state official said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to pull cleanup crews from an oil-stained beach caught authorities by surprise, but a spokesman for the oil company defended the decision The oil company removed its workers Saturday from a pebble-strewn beach on the north edge of <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a site described only shortly before by the ranking federal official in charge of the cleanup as `` far from clean.'' The site was one of those visited last week by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during his stopover in the state. Crews remained on the island, but at another oil-fouled landfall nearby, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said. The island is considered crucial to the annual seal pupping cycle. `` The people who were here last night from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> did n't know anything about this,'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, a scientist with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday. Exxon and state and federal officials have been conducting nightly meetings on the progress of the cleanup. <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said state and federal officials were surprised that the beach cleanup was halted because `` the beach was not adequately clean.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stilling </PERSON> said the cleanup crews were moved off the northern beach in order to attack more heavily soiled areas nearby. `` I think we fully intend to come back to that beach. I wo n't tell you we'll be back on that beach tomorrow,'' Stilling said `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- best judgment at this point is that it's time to move on.'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, an assistant regional administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said he was on the north beach Saturday morning and found it still `` very difficult to walk on'' because of the oil. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> faces a Wednesday deadline to have the worst of the oil cleansed from several islands in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, and has promised to clean some 364 miles of coastline by Sept. 15. The tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground on a reef in the sound on March 24 after filling its storage tanks with crude from the trans-Alaska pipeline. More than 10 million gallons of oil poured into the sound.

 Eight carnival-goers trapped in a broken `` super loop'' ride were rescued Sunday after being left dangling upside down and 60 feet in the air for more than two hours. `` Apparently, a light fixture had shaken loose and had come down on the tracks and jammed. When the little train came by it was stopped,'' said Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>. The ride in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, which was part of a traveling carnival and consists of connecting train cars that run on a hoop-shaped track, ground to a halt late Saturday at the top of the loop, leaving the eight thrill-seekers screaming for help. After a while, the trapped riders, tiring of being upside down, unbuckled their seat belts and sat on the safety cage surrounding the seats. Rescue workers feared it might not hold their weight, <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. Around 12:15 a.m., after about 2 -LCB- hours, firefighters using a cherry picker were able to take the passengers off the crippled ride two at a time, he said. No one was seriously injured, but two riders were taken to <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for treatment for exposure, <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said.

 Some foreign observers of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s presidential election said Sunday they saw no evidence of voting irregularities despite opposition predictions of fraud, but others were less flattering `` They -LRB- the government -RRB- tried to put on a nice play, but it was n't <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a West German observer invited by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s human rights commission. Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, invited by the Panamanian government, appeared satisfied with the voting process. `` The only problem I've seen is with the number of voters,'' he said, referring to the long lines of voters as he visited polls at the <ORGANIZATION> Torrijos-Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the sprawling, dusty, working-class suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>. He said there had been complaints in some precincts about ballots arriving late, but `` I've checked with the opposition and the government representatives at the polls ... and they do n't seem to have any problems at the places where I've been.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., part of an univited 13-member delegation sent by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said his group had seen irregularities `` The general belief is that the election will be stolen sometime tonight,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said as polls closed at 5 p.m. `` We've seen many irregularities but it is difficult to judge the extent of the irregularities,'' he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delegation arrived Saturday, apparently traveling under temporary duty orders from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. The Panamanian government had said the delegation was not welcome and would not be issued visas. But election officials allowed the group to visit polling places. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> echoed complaints by pollwatchers from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that hundreds of voters had been instructed to go to certain voting stations in precincts known to favor the opposition, only to get there and be told they were not registered. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` tolerated observers but did not let them get to close to the action,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was greeted in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> by cheering crowds of voters who yelled, `` <PERSON> Viva </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>!'' and `` We love you very much <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>.'' The elementary school is named after the 1977 treaties under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to hand over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, the late Panamanian dictator, signed the treaties. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> headed an observer delegation that included former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. He visited more than a half dozen voting places around <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delegation leader Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., said he saw no signs of irregularities but guards had threatened to remove a Costa Rican observer from polls at one precinct near the capital for allegedly being too close <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON> said the attempt was shouted down by opposition voters. `` People feel very strongly about this election. It is going to be difficult to have a fraudulent election and overcome what the polls indicate,'' he said. Published polls gave opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> a 2-to-1 edge over pro-government candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. The opposition, while welcoming the observers, predicted the election would be rigged. It said the government issued duplicate voting cards to some Panamanians, allowing them to vote more than once, and planned a fraudulent computer vote count. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, a Mexican observer invited, like <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, by the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said `` It's all quiet so far.'' He and other observers were told by the rights commission to stay 100 feet or so from the nearest booth to avoid the appearance of interference. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON>, an opposition spokesman, claimed that five Costa Rican observers were detained Saturday night in <LOCATION> Chitre </LOCATION> province, interrogated and had their luggage searched. They were released Sunday morning, he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was waiting for better weather Sunday before attempting to rescue 41 people stranded on a <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> island after their skiff capsized in rough seas. Crew members from the crab-processing ship <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> were stranded on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> after leaving their ship for a beachcombing trip Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. The ship, the 320-foot <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, is anchored an undetermined distance off <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which is about 425 miles north of the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The 66 crew members stil aboard the ship floated survival suits, food and radios to the island to held their stranded colleagues survive their first night. On Saturday, a C-130 aircraft dispatched from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> dropped tents, food, warm clothing, sleeping bags and fuel to the island, where it was snowing, <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. `` They are safe for the time being and I think relatively comfortable,'' he said Sunday. `` They were able to build a fire.'' As they waited for calmer weather, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>' crew patrolled the island's north coast, looking for a stretch of beach on which to land a flat-bottomed rescue vessel. Winds of 45 knots and seas up to 15 feet had prevented vessels from providing help on Friday and Saturday. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said he assumed the skiff had been ferrying small groups of crew members to the island when the craft capsized, tossing an undetermined number of people into the icy water. But he said the passengers were close enough to swim to shore, and there were no reports of injuries or hypothermia. The crew members are workers aboard the fish processor. `` I have no idea why they would be beachcombing in weather like this,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. The Coastal Star, which can carry 120 people, is based in <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and owned by <ORGANIZATION> Icicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafoods </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. No one answered the telephone at Icicle Seafoods on Sunday.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Jump Nearly Two Cents Per Gallon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gasoline prices jumped nearly two cents a gallon in the past two weeks as wholesalers passed on rising costs and took advantage of rising demand, an industry analyst said Sunday. The national average retail price for all grades of gasoline, including taxes, was 117.38 cents per gallon May 5, <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. That figure was up 1.95 cents per gallon over the price reported in the April 21 survey of 12,000 stations nationwide. Average prices at self-serve stations, which comprise most sales, were 106.60 cents per gallon for regular leaded, 108.13 for regular unleaded and 123.19 for premium unleaded. Full-serve prices were 130.08 for regular leaded, 132.39 for regular unleaded and 143.96 for premium unleaded. The jump was far smaller than the approximate 10 cents per gallon hike last month after the Valdez oil spill temporarily cinched oil supplies, but consumers who expected a price break were disappointed, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. `` A great deal of the prices we've seen in recent weeks has been directly related to the rising price of crude oil,'' which has risen by several dollars a gallon, she said. Prices also were affected by increased demand and by changes in gasoline composition mandated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to make gas less volatile during hot summer months, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. Prices could `` rise even faster and go significantly higher'' as summer demand goes up, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. But she said that was by no means certain because the seasonal demand, which peaks in July or August, is mitigated by increased competition.

 One of space shuttle Atlantis' main computers quit Sunday, and although it came back on line, ground controllers had the astronauts install a spare for Monday's critical re-entry and landing The flight crew dropped all other jobs to concentrate on the 4 -LCB- - hour job of installing the spare When the astronauts finished, <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> communicator <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jernigan </PERSON> radioed, `` We send our congratulations. Good work. This is the first time such a changeout has ever taken place in orbit.'' The extra work forced the crew members to delay their sleep period by an hour. Atlantis has four operating computers, one backup and one spare. They control and monitor all spacecraft systems, and actually fly the shuttle most of the time. Atlantis could land Monday with only one computer operating, if necessary. Flight director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON> said the loss of the computer posed no threat to the mission. `` We just do n't have the confidence to run with it for entry,'' he told reporters. Shuttle commander <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, `` It looks like GPC-4 has failed.'' He was directed to switch on General Purpose Computer No. 3, the spare. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> then restored No. 4 to operation. `` It seems to be working,'' he reported. After ground experts determined there was a hardware problem, they decided to take no chances with the unit and ordered the spare installed in No. 4's place. `` We'll terminate all the experiments and get at it,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. Dropped were one sample run in a materials processing furnace and photographs being taken of lightning and polluted areas on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON> said computer No. 4's reactivation indicated the failure was temporary. `` There might be something floating in there that caused a short,'' he said. `` We just know we do n't want to trust it.'' `` The failure had no impact on the the flight,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeson </PERSON>. `` The vehicle continues to perform normally.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> checked shuttle systems Sunday, making sure they were ready for the hourlong plunge from 184 miles up through the atmosphere Monday. Landing is scheduled for 12:43 p.m. PDT at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. CBS, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> plan to provide live coverage Monday of the landing of the space shuttle Atlantis. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage plans were incomplete Sunday. Earlier, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> had reported <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> was performing flawlessly and that the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, a robot probe the crew launched on a flight to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, was operating without a hitch. If Atlantis' flight continues as well as it has, `` I'd sure give it a 10 on my personal scale,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` You could n't ask for a better flying machine.'' The shuttle commander was answering questions beamed up from reporters at the Johnson Space Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> remarked that the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> launch was significant because it shows `` the human race is continuing its exploration of the solar system.'' <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> was more than a half-million miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Sunday on its 15-month journey to cloud-shrouded <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, and project scientists said all its systems were working well. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> was more than 158 million miles away. When <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> reaches <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in August 1990, it is to fire into orbit about the planet and map up to 90 percent of the surface with a high resolution radar system. Astronaut <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON> told reporters that the images obtained by the $ 550 million Magellan project should tell scientists not only about the history of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> but also about the evolution of its sister planet, <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. He noted that <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, shrouded in sulfuric acid clouds and a carbon dioxide atmosphere, has a runaway greenhouse effect that has resulted in surface temperatures of 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Many scientists fear that Earth is warming up and may experience a severe greenhouse effect itself sometime in the future. To help prevent that happening, <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON> said, `` we need to know the mechanisms whereby these things occur.'' The Edwards forecast called for favorable weather, with high scattered clouds and visibility of seven miles. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> expected a relatively small crowd of 100,000 on hand for the landing. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said <PERSON> Atlantis </PERSON> was n't expected to draw as many people as some past shuttle flights because it is landing on a weekday. An estimated 460,000 people watched Discovery touch down March 18, a Saturday. Mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON> began packing up and stowing equipment and experiments as the four-day orbital journey neared an end. The workload was limited because the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe and its rocket booster, which together weighed 45,000 pounds, did not allow for many experiments to be carried aboard. Cleave said the light workload enabled her to concentrate more time on a materials processing furnace where she melted and resolidified small samples of a metal called indium to see how the process works in weightlessness. `` It's been working perfectly and we hope to bring back some good indium crystals,'' she said. Potential applications for such space-made materials include advanced electronic and optical devices devoid of the contamination that occurs naturally during processing in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s gravity. Most of the other experiments involved photography of polluted areas on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and of lightning strikes in the atmosphere.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said Sunday he is counseling the teen-age suspects in the gang rape of a Central Park jogger to ease their suffering and has visited the victim and her family several times. `` It was clear that she and her family were suffering so much,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said of the victim and her parents. But the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader said he felt compelled to also reach out to the suspects' families. `` I realized that the families of those boys would be suffering and I would make myself available to do anything that I could do to help them,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said outside St. Patrick's Cathedral. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he wrote the parents of the six youths accused in the April 19 attack and `` told them that I was available to assist in any way that I could without entering into the judicial process.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he subsequently met with five of the boys at <ORGANIZATION> Spofford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and with the sixth suspect at the <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> jail. It was not clear when the visits took place. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he `` walked away with a great sense of sadness'' after his visit with the boys and described the park attack as a `` complex nightmare.'' `` Those kids, their lives will have to be changed whatever happens to them by way of the judicial process and the families, they must be traumatized,'' he said. The victim, a28-year-old Wall Street investment banker, was attacked while jogging after dark along her usual route in Central Park. She was beaten, raped and left for dead in a mud puddle, and spent two weeks in a coma, police said. She emerged from a coma last week, and was in critical and stable condition on Sunday, hospital officials said. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he deliberately avoided talking about the attack with the suspects and spoke in general terms to the boys. `` I talked the kind of thing that one talks with lads who are confined under those circumstances,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` Where are you in school? Where are you in the family? How many kids in your family?'' He said the boys were glad to see him and asked him to return. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he planned to meet with some of the boys' parents sometime this week.

 Panamanians voted for a new president Sunday in an election fraught with charges of fraud and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference, and some foreign observers complained of voting irregularities. The election, seen as a referendum on the de facto rule of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, pitted <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, hand-picked by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, against <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, the candidate of an opposition coalition. `` The triumph of the opposition is indisputable,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said after polls closed at 5 p.m. -LRB- 6 p.m. EDT -RRB- but before any results had been announced. He called for a march Monday to safeguard the results. Although <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> cited no figures, the opposition released an exit poll claiming that 55.1 percent of 1,022 voters said they had chosen <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and 39.5 percent said they had voted for Duque. In the only reported incident of violence, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church said a Dutch priest was shot and seriously wounded by soldiers as he urged people over a loudspeaker to go to the polls in the western city of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. Voters began lining up at some polling stations at 5 a.m., two hours before the scheduled opening. At one booth, more than 100 of 348 registered voters were in line by 8 a.m. By late afternoon, the lines were gone. The government promised official results within 24 hours after closing time. The opposition accused the government of making arrangements for its supporters to vote `` early and often'' and said they feared the election would be stolen as votes were tallied at the Election Tribunal. Opposition leaders pointed out that the 15,000 members of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> were allowed to jump to the front of voting lines and they could vote at any booth, making multiple voting possible. They said hundreds of opposition supporters who went to the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bautista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> to vote were told they were not registered to do so. The college is in a wealthy <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> district. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., part of a 13-member uninvited delegation sent by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said: `` The general belief is that the election will be stolen sometime tonight. `` We've seen many irregularities, but it is difficult to judge the extent of the irregularities,'' he said. `` They tried to put on a nice play, but it was n't <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a West German observer invited by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s human rights commission. Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, however, said he had seen no irregularities. `` The only problem I've seen is with the number of voters,'' he said, referring to the long lines of voters. He said there had been complaints in some precincts about ballots arriving late, but `` I've checked with the opposition and the government representatives at the polls ... and they do n't seem to have any problems at the places where I've been.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was invited by the Panamanian government along with former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic bishop of <PERSON> David </PERSON>, said that Rev. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleef </PERSON> was arrested inside a car by the Defense Forces while urging a high voter turnout and criticizing fraud over a car loudspeaker. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleef </PERSON> was shot while inside the car and was listed in `` grave'' condition, the church said. Telephone calls to government spokesmen for comment were not returned. The government contends the opposition has joined forces with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an effort to abrogate the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, which call for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999. As proof, <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> pointed to damaging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and reports that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided the opposition with $ 10 million in campaign assistance. The opposition denies the government charges, and says <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must be eased out as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces if democracy is to progress in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> and acting president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> received a mixture of boos and cheers when they voted. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, 59, are both businessmen. A new president takes office Sept. 1. A pro-government newspaper, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Republica </PERSON>, published official <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> figures showing pro-government parties with 611,000 registered members out of 1.18 million registered voters. Opposition vice-presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> issued a statement saying he had `` not the slightest doubt that there will be fraud.'' He was one of the leaders calling for a protest march Monday. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> repeated accusations that the electoral register included 100,000 duplicate names and that out of a sampling of 3,000 recent deaths, the names of 27 percent of the dead were still on the register. Several voters told reporters they had checked to make sure dead or absent relatives were stricken from the voting list. `` That's two less votes they can steal,'' said <PERSON> Lilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> after making sure officials crossed off the names of her brother and father, both out of the country. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hold over the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> has given him effective control of the government since 1983, and he has been able to remove presidents at will. In the last election, in 1984, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> was narrowly elected over <ORGANIZATION> Arnulfo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> amid cries of fraud. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> resign and installed <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president in 1985. When <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in February 1988 after the general was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster and installed <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> as acting president. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the drug charges.

All of those rescued were in good condition, <PERSON> Merrell </PERSON> said. The crab processing ship, the 320-foot <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, was anchored off the island about 425 miles north of the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The sailors were stranded on the island Friday after leaving the ship for a beachcombing trip, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. The 66 crew members still aboard the ship floated survival suits, food and radios to the island to held their stranded colleagues survive their first night. On Saturday, a C-130 aircraft dispatched from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> dropped tents, food, warm clothing, sleeping bags and fuel to the island, where it was snowing, <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. Winds of 45 knots and seas up to 15 feet prevented vessels from providing help on Friday and Saturday. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said he assumed the skiff had been ferrying small groups of crew members to the island when the craft capsized, tossing an undetermined number of people into the icy water. But he said the passengers were close enough to swim to shore, and there were no reports of injuries or hypothermia. The crew members are workers aboard the fish processor. `` I have no idea why they would be beachcombing in weather like this,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. The Coastal Star, which can carry 120 people, is based in <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and owned by <ORGANIZATION> Icicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafoods </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. No one answered the telephone at Icicle Seafoods on Sunday.

 An out-of-season snowstorm left more than 10 inches of snow on the ground in western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state on Sunday, and powerful thunderstorms caused flash flooding in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Low-temperature records were set in more than a dozen cities from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, 10.1 inches of snow piled up by late Sunday, shattering that city's record for snowfall by more than 6 -LCB- inches. Seven inches of snow fell in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and snow broke tree limbs and downed power lines throughout the western Finger Lakes. The unusual weather was caused by low pressure centered over extreme south-central Quebec that drew moist, cold air south across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Appalachian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. Snow fell over parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. By early afternoon, temperatures had risen above freezing over most of the area and the snow was either mixed with rain or changed to rain. Severe thunderstorms raked parts of north-central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with heavy rains and golf ball-size hail. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was especially hard hit. The slow movement of the storms caused some flash flooding over parts of Young, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pinto </LOCATION> counties. Elsewhere, scattered showers lingered from <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, and rain and snow were mixed across northern sections of lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, recorded a record high temperature for the date of 79 degrees.

<HEAD>Congressmen Criticize Boeing Sale to South African Airways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it will sell up to $ 502 million worth of 747 jumbo jets to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in a deal which drew strong criticism from members of the state's congressional delegation. The aircraft maker based here and <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Transport Minister <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Louw </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> said in separate announcements Saturday South African Airways would buy two <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 jets for $ 256 million. The planes are to be delivered in November 1990 and May 1991. The government-owned airline also has options for two more aircraft, which would be delivered in 1992 for another $ 256 million. Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., is `` violently opposed to the sale,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` He finds it very inappropriate.'' House Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> he thinks <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials know there are strong feelings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid, or racial segregation <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he had a `` forthright talk'' with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Commercial Airplanes President <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, who told him that `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has a longstanding policy to sell its planes without regard to foreign policy as long as the sale is legal.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies do not prohibit such sales to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> shareholders recently voted down a stockholder-proposed measure that would have prohibited doing business with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has no office, employees or investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleh </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> markets to airlines throughout the world so long as they're countries the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government permits sales to be made in,'' <PERSON> Schleh </PERSON> said. `` When it comes to the question of whether aircraft should be sold in a particular country, it's a decision best made by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, a Democrat whose district includes <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, opposes the sale and is a sponsor of a resolution to increase trade sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>'s staff director, said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> earlier in the week that a sale was being negotiated. `` I've come back to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to try to meet with them and see what's going on and why,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Representative <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> has expressed in no uncertain terms that he is opposed to the sale.'' `` At this point there is no specific violation of the 1986 Anti-apartheid Act because it appears to be a commercial sale,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' spokeswoman. `` But that does not excuse the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> from taking an insensitive position.'' The Anti-apartheid Act prohibits the sale of some technology to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that could be used by the government or military. `` This is considered a commercial transaction,'' <PERSON> Schleh </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has sold 53 airliners to South African Airways.

 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s billboard confronts one of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s greatest concentrations of influential businesses, catching the eye like a red flag on the I-94 `` automation alley'' thoroughfare linking <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> `` <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, Start Your Engines. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Is Open For Business,'' it reads. The <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> corporations and communities help pay for billboards such as that one in cities ranging from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. Visits from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> emissaries follow in search of more industries like <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>'s high technology and computer companies, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>'s medical research facilities and forest products enterprises statewide, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> officials try to lure companies and travelers by advertising in other states too, but they are n't heading for <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> _ with banjos, billboards or any other direct counterattack. `` We do n't do billboards. We've never felt it would necessarily do the job for us,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandner </PERSON> of the tourist-seeking state <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. There will also be no ` Bama billboard battle by the state <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which goes after new offices and plants, marketing unit director <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` As opposed to going into a number of different states, we have targeted particular industries,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` Then we have searched out the most rapidly growing industries in those categories.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s department spends $ 3 million a year on advertising to lure business to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sandner </PERSON>'s agency spends $ 4.5 million to draw tourists. Battling back, neighoring <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are familiar advertisers for tourists in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, as well as southerly destinations like <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> spends its tourist ad money on television, magazine, newspaper supplement and radio ads in many of those same states, <PERSON> Sandner </PERSON> said. It attracts most of its tourists from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. When summer simmers, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, are ideal targets for magazine spreads showing rippling waters and golf greens that stay green. `` We'll use a four-color photo of some spectacular Great Lakes scene _ water scenes _ and hint that the water goes on forever. The subliminal message being when July and August get to be too much in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, come on up to our peninsulas and cool off,'' he said. When <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> wants to bag businesses, it does n't aim at neighbors, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` Our posture has been not to go robbing <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> to pay <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. Ultimately you end up redistributing the number of businesses between the two states and really not increasing the amount of business activity. `` You're just capturing one for the one that left,'' he said. `` We're looking to expand the ones that are here and capture the ones looking at new locations.''

<HEAD>Family Seeks Restructuring of Stock-Holding Method</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The family of the man who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> discount chain wants to restructure the way they hold company stock, which could result in substantial tax benefits, according to the company's proxy report. The <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> family members now hold 218 million <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> shares, worth about $ 7.7 billion, as owners of a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> corporation called <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> that actually holds the stock. The individual <ORGANIZATION> Waltons </ORGANIZATION> _ company founder <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> and his four children, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Alice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> _ own roughly equal shares of <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. The recently released <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> proxy report says the family has proposed to hold ownership of the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> shares through a partnership instead of a corporation. The report said family members `` may obtain very substantial future tax advantages'' by changing their holding method to a partnership. To do that, the <ORGANIZATION> Waltons </ORGANIZATION> have proposed an exchange of stock with <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, provided that there is a tax ruling that the exchange itself would not be taxed. The <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> board has named a committee of its independent directors to review the proposed exchange and negotiate its terms. Little Rock tax lawyer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plastiras </PERSON> said tax laws would apply differently to <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stock held in a partnership instead of through a corporation if there later is a distribution of the stock to individual partners, upon dissolution of the partnership, or to <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> stockholders if it were dissolved as a corporation. `` They can dissolve the partnership in a non-taxable event,'' <PERSON> Plastiras </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON>, an analyst for the Little Rock investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Staephens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal `` has nothing to do with the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- company'' as such. The Walton-controlled stock still would be controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Waltons </ORGANIZATION>, he said.

 They know their efforts could be wiped out by the liquidation of their company or a housecleaning by a new owner, but a group of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees is keeping up a skeleton operation at the strikebound carrier. `` It's a risk, but I happen to believe in what we're doing, so it's a risk you take,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tripp </PERSON>, explaining why he has stayed with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> despite its uncertain future. <PERSON> Tripp </PERSON> was mopping floors Friday as the strike by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s machinists, pilots and flight attendants entered its third month The 23-year Eastern employee wearing the grimed workclothes is normally manager of internal distribution. `` This is Management Development 101,'' he said. `` I'm doing all the things I usually supervise from my white-collar job.'' With 4,500 employees, down from nearly 30,000 before the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers are averaging 10 to 12 hours a day without extra compensation and most have several sets of duties. The carrier is flying about 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, is hoping a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge will approve a plan that provides for the sale of $ 1.8 billion in assets, leaving a smaller, reorganized carrier staffed by nonunion workers. Eastern's unions say the carrier, which filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code after the strike began, should be sold to one of several prospective buyers who have until May 10 to submit bids. Some independent analysts have said Eastern should be liquidated. But the remaining <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers want to see their company pull through. `` Chapter 11 _ It's the First Chapter of the Rest of Your Life'' proclaim posters throughout the carrier's headquarters and its shops at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` Eastern Will Survive,'' other signs promise. Smaller, handwritten signs taped to bathroom doors remind employees that there are no paid cleaners anymore, so each employee must help keep things clean. Few people are doing only their normal, prestrike jobs. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, the domestic advertising manager, was in overalls Friday, working in the wheels and brakes department. He also helps pack the liquor kits for flights. Nearby, two computer programmers were repairing plane tires. <LOCATION> Cira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tellechea </LOCATION>, an area sales manager, was welding an aluminum patch onto a plane part. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> averaged 71 passengers on its 110 or so daily flights _ less than one-third capacity for many of its planes. But the airline's remaining workers point to stellar on-time rates of 96.5 percent and reduced complaints about lost bags and other passenger problems. `` It's a piece of cake, no sweat at all,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouellette </PERSON>, a supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, where dispatchers monitor the locations of all of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s planes and crews. `` With 110 flights a day when we're used to 1,000 or more, things are very efficient.'' Eastern is getting ready to add more flights, with 264 new pilots in training and interviews scheduled with 270 more this week. The company took out newspapers ads Sunday to hire new mechanics, and the first new flight attendants began training last week and schools for 56 each in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will probably begin this week.

 Insurance company officials, freed by a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling from the prospect of mandatory rate rollbacks, say they could adapt to the rest of an insurance initiative passed by voters last fall. The court's ruling Thursday upheld most of Proposition 103, a consumer-sponsored initiative that gives the state greater control over insurers. But the court rejected parts of the initiative that called for mandatory rollbacks and a one-year freeze of auto, property and liability rates at 20 percent below November 1987 levels.
