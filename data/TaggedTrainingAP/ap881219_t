<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> on Monday announced plans for talks on possible reforms to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s electoral laws, a key demand of opposition politicians from both right and left. A statement from the president's office said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will begin `` a great public consultation'' next month and the Chamber of Deputies will discuss electoral reform at a special June session. The opposition says election laws are designed and administered to ensure continued rule by the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has held power since 1929. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, who ran for president as nominee of the right-of-center <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has been on a public fast since Thursday to dramatize his party's demand for electoral reform. Party president <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' proposals do not go far enough for <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> to stop his hunger strike. He complained that `` they still have n't set up a special commission in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to begin changing election laws right now.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' announcement came after he met with representatives of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>, which backed runner-up <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> in disputed July 6 elections. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> came third. It was <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' second meeting with an opposition party since he took office Dec. 1. The day after his inauguration, he met <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> maintained his lead Tuesday in presidential elections marred by attacks from Sinhalese extremists who killed at least 15 people, officials said. Although the violence did not stop Monday's balloting in this ethnically divided island nation, it kept droves of eligible voters away. Turnout in reporting districts was below 50 percent of eligible voters. With 104 of 182 polling districts counted, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 1,155,594 votes, or 51 percent, according to state television. His main rival, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 1,001,572, or 44 percent. <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonesekera </PERSON>, head of a coalition of four small leftist parties, polled 99,129, or 4 percent. About 9.3 million people were eligible to vote. Turnout in the reporting districts was about 47 percent of eligible voters. Deputy Elections Commissioner <PERSON> Lakshman </PERSON> <PERSON> Perera </PERSON> compared it with 80 percent nationwide in the last presidential election six years ago. Sir <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has 9.3 million registered voters. In the north, where militants of the Tamil minority are fighting for an independent state, many districts reported less than 10 percent turnout. And in the south, where Sinhalese extremists of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> oppose government concessions to the Tamils, turnout ranged from 20-70 percent All three candidates pledged to end ethnic strife that has brought this former tourist paradise off the southern tip of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to the brink of ruin. At least 8,500 people have been killed since separatists from the Tamil minority began a civil war in 1983. `` This is a battle between the ballot and the bullet. The bullet must not win,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said after voting in the capital, <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Attacks by Sinhalese militants began after an agreement 18 months ago that promised Tamils regional autonomy in the north and east and introduced Indian troops to help disarm the rebels. <PERSON> Perera </PERSON> blamed violence and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> threats to kill voters for the low turnout. The front is made up of Sinhalese extremists who oppose terms outgoing President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> offered for settlement of the Tamil war. They have vowed to kill anyone who supported the government. All the presidential candidates are Sinhalese, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> group that makes up 75 percent of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and runs the government, judiciary and military. Tamils, who are overwhelmingly Hindu and total 18 percent of the population, claim discrimination by the Sinhalese. Hundreds of people have been killed in the violence blamed on Sinhalese extremists. On Monday, police and military officials reported bomb and gun attacks on five voting stations in the Sinhalese heartland near the capital in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Nine voters, a soldier and a policeman were killed and 25 people were wounded, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A police sergeant, an election official and a driver were killed in ambushes of two jeeps carrying ballot boxes after polls closed in the southern <LOCATION> Moneragala </LOCATION> district, the military said. Police in <LOCATION> Ambalanagoda </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, reported an officer killed. Military forces and police guarded polling places, particularly in the south where the Sinhalese gunmen operate. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel with automatic rifles joined police on guard duty at <LOCATION> Kaluthra </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of the capital. Soldiers were deployed at such crowded public places as the town's main bus station. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> campaigned as a champion of the poor and promised monthly allowances equivalent to $ 75 for the poorest families but did not explain how he would pay for it. He and Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, who was prime minister in 1960-66 and 1970-77, oppose the agreement with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> under which 47,000 Indian troops are in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, former known as <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abeygoonasekera </PERSON> blamed both major parties for <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s economic and ethnic problems

<TEXT>
 Spiraling real estate prices last year have boosted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s actual assets past its gross national product for the first time, the government said today. The value of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s actual assets _ its land and structures _ rose 20.2 percent to $ 3.04 trillion last year, while its GNP was $ 2.87 trillion, said <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Eiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakao </PERSON>. Last year's soaring prices made land assets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a country roughly the size of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, worth 4.1 times as much as all the land in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In 1986, Japanese land value was calculated at 2.5 times that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Financial assets such as equity and deposits also rose, to $ 23.2 billion _ a 15.6 percent increase over 1986, the agency said. `` Rapid rise in land prices and booming stock trading'' fueled the explosion of assets, agency officials said. Urban land prices have stabilized somewhat in recent months following a series of measures by the central and local governments to control the spiral, but prices continue to rise in fast-growing suburbs.

<TEXT>
 A winter storm that locked much of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in an icy grip of snow and frigid temperatures has left at least six people dead and five others missing and presumed drowned, news reports said. About 30 small mountain villages in central and southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and 10 on the island of <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> were still isolated Sunday by snow, up to two six-feet deep in some places. The snow blocked blocked roads and passes. Four of the missing were aboard the oceanography research vessel Posillipo-Loran, missing and presumed sunk in the storm-tossed sea off <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. Waves as high as 21 feet hampered the search for the crew. The body of a fisherman whose boat apparently was swamped during the storm washed up on a beach near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> early Sunday. Authorities were still looking for the other man aboard the boat, who was presumed drowned. Italian news reports said five other deaths from traffic accidents and heart failure had been attributed to the snow and cold. The thermometer dipped as low as six degrees below zero in the Dolomites in far northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and to freezing as far south as <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. None of the snow fell on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but the city was gripped by freezing temperatures.

<TEXT>
 A federal study to determine whether a drug can fight the onset of AIDS in people who carry the AIDS virus may be delayed because of a failure to attract enough volunteers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to a published report. Six <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> medical centers participating in the study have attracted only 257 volunteers, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. Recruitment may be suffering because carriers of the AIDS virus do not want to risk being among the volunteers given a placebo and not the drug, it said. The study was designed to see whether AZT, or azidothymidine, can prevent or delay the onset of AIDS in people who carry the virus but have not developed symptoms of the disease. The antiviral agent has already been shown to prolong the lives of seriously ill AIDS patients. Some volunteers in the study are given AZT while others are given a placebo. Clinics in other cities participating in the study have not experienced serious recruitment difficulties. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> had 166 patients enrolled in the study, while <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had just nine volunteers after five months of recruitment through newspaper advertisements, doctors who have large AIDS practices and gay organizations. The recruitment problems in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has more AIDS patients than any other city, could slow down the entire study, the Times said. Some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> study participants also may be cheating by taking steps to find out if they are getting AZT or the placebo, and then dropping out of the study or getting AZT from other doctors, the newspaper reported. Some volunteers in the study also are said to be taking anti-AIDS drugs that have not been approved for use, it said. Act Up, an AIDS organization, has charged that other tests for experimental drugs at three city medical schools have excluded the poor, minorities and women by drawing their volunteers from private hospitals, where most AIDS patients are white, middle-class men, rather than from municipal hospitals, the Times said.

 Chinese have died in fires at a rate of seven per day over the past decade, an official newspaper reported today.

 The spirit of polygamist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, gunned down by lawmen nearly a decade ago, is a constant presence at the murder trial of three young men who took up arms for his cause. It lives in his son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, who has spoken with anguish of his father's death, and in the testimony of <LOCATION> Addam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swapp </LOCATION>, husband of two of Singer's daughters and his father-in-law's spiritual heir And it is felt in the German immigrant's handmade buckskin coat, worn by <PERSON> Addam </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, and in the volumes of Mormon scripture the three defendants have brought each day to a courtroom where closing arguments were scheduled today and the jury, after nine days of testimony, was expected to begin deliberating. Singer and the Swapp brothers are charged with murdering a state officer during a gunfight that ended the clan's 13-day standoff with police at their Marion homestead last winter. The confrontation began after Singer and the Swapp brothers bombed a nearby Mormon chapel on Jan. 16, the ninth anniversary of the elder Singer's death, and retreated to the family compound. Clan leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, said the bombing was prompted by a divine revelation. `` It has to do with the injustices perpetrated against our family,'' he testified. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> was shot in the back, and nobody cared. `` The truth has been trampled on more than once, and we took a stand,'' <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said. `` We knew we had to do it. We knew we had to take one day at a time and trust in our God.'' Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, who had joined an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> team in an attempt to arrest the Swapps on Jan. 28, was ordering a reluctant police dog to subdue the pair when he was shot in a volley of rifle fire from the wheelchair-bound Singer. Singer, 22, admitted firing the fatal shot but contended he was aiming at the dogs. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, an excommunicated <PERSON> Mormon </PERSON>, married <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> in 1980 and her sister <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> a few years later. The father of seven, he has said he believed the bombing would trigger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s resurrection and the collapse of a `` wicked and corrupt'' church and state Singer's widow, <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON>, says her husband's death was the result of a conspiracy between state authorities and church officials angry at his open practice of polygamy and refusal to send his children to public schools. The Mormon church officially abandoned polygamy in 1890. The Singers, also excommunicated Mormons, taught their children at home to shield them from a system they believed was tainted by sexual promiscuity, drug abuse and racial mixing. Finally, fearing the state would place his children in foster homes, Singer, 48, holed up in the compound for 18 days before being shot by officers in 1979. Police said he pointed a gun at officers trying to arrest him. In an interview taped by federal agents and played for the jury, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> said that his father was shot as he walked to a mailbox. `` All these men zoomed in on him on snowmobiles, 10 men, what I've heard,'' he said. `` And he pulled out his gun and he, you know, -LRB- said -RRB- ` Back off, I do n't want any trouble now.' And he turned around to run home, my sister saw this through binoculars, and as he turned around to run home they shot him two to three times in the back.'' The younger Singer, a thin, quiet man left a paraplegic by a logging accident four years ago, told of his mother's wrongful death lawsuit, which was dismissed by a federal judge for insufficient evidence. `` I mean, we could n't get justice,'' he said. `` I mean, my dad's been killed and shot, and it would n't even be tried. If convicted, Singer and the Swapp brothers face five years to life in prison. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> already has been sentenced to 15 years in prison on federal charges related to the bombing and standoff. Singer and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> were given 10-year sentences in the case, while <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> was sentenced to five years.

<TEXT>
 The columns of tanks are gone from city streets, and hundreds of soldiers who staged an abortive rebellion earlier this month have returned to the barracks. But <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s military remains restive, and no one is predicting that the third insurrection in 20 months against the civilian government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> will be the last. `` The military crisis was resolved, not the military question,'' says <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berhongaray </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` There could be another insurrection.'' Government officials have worked since the four-day revolt ended Dec. 4 to assess the loyalty of army units _ some of which openly sided with the rebels, and others which refused to confront them _ and to meet some of the rebel demands. A general who publicly sympathized with rebel commander Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> was retired, and the government hastily put together funds to give soldiers a 20 percent pay increase and a Christmas bonus. That may reduce tensions in the ranks, but it does n't address the root of the problem, say some prominent Argentines. Many in the military want an end to human rights trials of officers for their roles in a campaign of repression during the 1976-83 military dictatorship. They want a better role in society for the military, which lost the 1982 Falklands War and led <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> into economic chaos during its rule. But <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s military has toppled six civilian leaders since 1930, and some say it has never learned its place in society. `` The point is, the central point is, the military does not respond to civilian political power,'' says <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, director of the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize. In an interview at his sparsely furnished office, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> referred to one of the last incidents of the rebellion and said, `` Right in front of ` loyal' troops, ` rebels' fired tear gas and shot at civilians.'' `` There are n't ` loyal' troops. They're all accomplices of the rebels,'' he said, his voice devoid of stridency or anger. `` They share the same ideology. They only differ in method. Some were against the insurrection, some wanted to work through the political system.'' On Dec. 12, the commander of the 5th army corps, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrucci </PERSON>, confirmed the suspicions of many when he said the insurrection ended with an agreement between army chief Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>. There is widespread doubt that loyal troops `` suffocated'' the rebellion, as <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> ordered them to do, but instead reached an agreement with the rebels, the terms of which have yet to be disclosed. That prospect unsettles, among others, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, president of the 8,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Asked if the end of the rebellion meant democracy in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> was strengthened, or the institution of the presidency was fortified, <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> shook his head from side to side and said: `` I think the situation of civilian political power is worse because the armed forces demonstrated that they are loyal to themselves and not to the president and commander-in-chief -LRB- <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> -RRB-. `` The conclusion I draw is that the military does n't want power right now because the situation is not favorable. They would be repudiated by the people and economically, they would be taking over a situation that would not allow them to govern. ... They do n't want power, but they want to give the orders.'' Their demand for a recuperation of military honor and dignity, which had widespread resonance through the ranks, was a reaffirmation of the military view that the battle to curtail the kidnappings, bombings and assassinations of the 1970s was a civil war. A speech Saturday by Defense Minister <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> supported that view. <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> said the campaign, through brutal, was necessary. The view of human rights groups and others is that the arrest, `` disappearance'' and presumed execution of 9,000 Argentines was a brutal repression of society. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> has portrayed the end of the rebellion as a clear-cut victory in which organized labor, big business, foreign governments and tens of thousands of Argentines who gathered in plazas to protest the insurrection forced the rebels to give in. But the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with an eye to May 1989 national elections, is criticizing <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> for his handling of the revolt, and demanding he develop a policy toward the military that reduces the risk of another revolt. Asked what effect the insurrection might have in the election, pollster <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON> said, `` We're asking ourselves that, but so far we do n't know ... It has n't ended.''

 Seventeen-year-old <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galang </PERSON> still wakes up screaming, haunted by the faces of the 23 relatives he lost a year ago when the ferry Dona Paz sank with more than 3,000 people aboard. <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON>, then a high school senior, was one of only 26 passengers and crew who survived after the 2,215-ton <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> collided with the 629-ton oil tanker Vector and exploded off <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> island the night of Dec. 20, 1987.

It was his first time on a ship. Suddenly, about 10 p.m., he felt a strong thud. He ran for a wall and squeezed himself through a porthole. `` I struggled free and fell into the water,'' he recalled. `` I could n't hear anything anymore. There was just silence. The sea was on fire. My face was scalded. The water was very hot as if it were boiling water. I swam so fast. I do n't know how I did it.'' <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> and the other survivors were rescued by a passing ship and brought to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. There, he saw Rose. Burned and bandaged, he raced to embrace her. But the joy of reunion soon gave way to resentment. Relatives blamed him for not saving other family members. `` They ask me ` <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON>, Why did you not save your cousins?''' he said, fighting back tears. `` I tell them, ` There was nothing I could do.' It was difficult enough saving myself. Maybe if I tried to save them, we would all have died.'' Since the disaster, <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> said he has shunned other relatives, including his parents, who live in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> is also bitter at the government, which he says abandoned him. He received 5,000 pesos, or $ 250, which President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> allocated for each survivor. But he said there has been no psychological counseling or rehabilitation for the survivors. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> recommended <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> for a job in a pharmacy but the company refused to hire him. His family is too poor to afford fees to complete his final year of high school. He works as an unpaid volunteer for an association of relatives of <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> victims and survives on charity. <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> said he and some relatives of victims have refused to accept a $ 1,500 lump sum payment from the shipowners, <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, because the company insists they sign a waiver promising no further claims. In April, a group of survivors and relatives filed a class action suit seeking more compensation. The case was dismissed and an appeal is pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In the meantime, <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> is considering becoming a priest. `` When I think about the things I've gone through and am going through, I think that maybe God wants me to be a priest and serve him,'' he said. `` At this point, I have nothing else to lose and I am ready to offer my life.'' The sense of loneliness and abandonment is all the more painful at Christmas. Last Christmas, five days after the tragedy, <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> spent the day crying in a corner of his parents' home, gazing out the window. This year, he plans to spend the holiday alone. `` I ca n't bear to face them again,'' he said.

 The scantily dressed dancers are long gone. The last liquor store was blown up six years ago. This ancient Roman city now is the capital in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of Shiite Moslem fundamentalism. Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief male-female unions called pleasure marriages are condoned. On the surface at least, life in <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> is governed by the dictates of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s stern brand of Islamic fundamentalism in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which to Western eyes appears joyless and forbidding. Wearing make-up or jewelery in public is taboo. So is singing and dancing at mixed gatherings, because as one woman noted, `` it causes psychological imbalance and tempts men.'' But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like chadors Shiite women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of shorts and strapless tops, along with make-up and perfume. `` People think we're made of stone just because we cover ourselves with chadors. But we're not. We're ready to do anything to please our husbands,'' said <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, a housewife. Before <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war erupted in 1975, <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> was a cultural center where dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking Roman amphitheaters. Now the ruins echo to Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage political rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>! Death to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>!'' The amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sectarian fighting. The Shiites' strict lifestyle has drawn bitter criticism from many Lebanese, Moslems and Christians alike, who say that the fundamentalists' `` double standards'' has brought Islam into disrepute. Most Shiites in <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> belong to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Party of God -RRB-, which is believed to be an umbrella for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> kidnappers holding most of the 15 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It's made up of zealots blindly loyal to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. `` We follow whatever <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> decrees. Whatever he rejects, we reject,'' said <PERSON> Zeinab </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, an administrator at the women's `` haouzeh,'' or religious center, in <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on by other Lebanese, especially moderate Shiites and Sunnis. In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl of her hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in the name of religion. But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered respectable and far from promiscuous. The practice is widespread in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where overwhelming majority of the 54 million population is Shiite. <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> said the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period which could last `` for an hour, two days, a month, or as long as they desire.'' `` It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born after the marriage contract expires,'' she explained. She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s economic crisis because `` men can not afford a regular marriage, and let's face it, they have physical needs `` If these can not be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage provides the outlet,'' she added. `` It's much better than doing it illicitly.'' No cleric is required to perform the cermony. The woman, who should preferably be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, `` I give myself to you in pleasure.'' He responds: `` I accept.'' And that's it. Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek it. As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical music `` because it does not have any negative psychological effects,'' <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> said. She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is bad for `` the nerves and the blood circulation.'' Like other factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where the government has collapsed, the Shiites have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leader, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` Social work has become one of our main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We've founded the <ORGANIZATION> Imam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khomeini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> here which provides free medical treatment. There are similar centers in other Shiite areas.'' He noted: `` We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit, as well as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near future. `` We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to provide wells in remote villages, especially those we consider have military or political importance.'' Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and night clubs, <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON> noted: `` We're not imposing Islamic values on people. No one can say we've raided houses where people gamble or drink.'' Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: `` There were incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal after witnessing aberrant behavior. But <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is against that.''

<TEXT>
 A 39-year-old alderman on Sunday became the only Hispanic candidate to enter the mayor's race, while reports conflicted on whether former Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> would announce her intention to regain her old office. <ORGANIZATION> WBBM-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported late Sunday that Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said she would file her nominating petitions Monday and would announce her candidacy as a Republican. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> confirmed Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s plans and also said he would meet Monday with another rumored <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate, former <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, the television station said. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s home telephone went unanswered Sunday evening. A local radio station, WMAQ-AM, said it had talked with Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> on Sunday and she had indicated she did not intend to file petitions Monday, the deadline. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliz </PERSON>, president pro tem of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, announced his candidacy, saying he could bridge the city's racial divisions better than either the announced white or black candidates <PERSON> Soliz </PERSON> joined five other Democrats _ three black and two white _ in seeking the highest office in the heavily Democratic city. The only announced <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate is <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON>, the son of a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> secretary of State. Republican slatemakers recently declined to endorse <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON>, saying instead that <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> and four lesser-known unannounced candidates have their go-ahead to run. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> served her term as mayor, 1979-83, as a Democrat. In the Democratic mayoral primary of 1983, she split the white vote with <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, which allowed the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> to win the nomination, and ultimately to become the city's first black mayor. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> died of a heart attack in November 1987 a few months after winning a second term. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has set April 4 as the date for a special election to fill the remaining two years of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second term The Democratic primary is scheduled for Feb. 28. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, again is a candidate for the Democratic nomination, as are <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s successor, Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aldermen </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, former state Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soliz </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and Bloom are white, while <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> are black. Another black alderman, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, dropped out of the race Thursday, saying <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> would win the election unless blacks unite behind a single candidate. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> pledged his support to <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Soliz </PERSON> said he hopes for the support of other local Hispanic leaders, although he acknowledged that two other Hispanics in the City Council have already thrown their support to <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. The city's population is a little more than 40 percent white, 40 percent black, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent of other races.

 The government is looking for a dozen men who would n't mind feasting on a diet of King salmon for 100 days. They'd even get paid a $ 2,300 salary. But there's a catch for those who participate in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> study. `` We're talking about salmon with dill weed, broiled salmon, baked salmon _ just like the fine restaurant food,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, project coordinator for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the Presidio. He said the study should begin in January, and cautioned that it might not be quite as tantalizing as it sounds because it entails confinement, lots of physical tests and no conjugal visits. Participants will sleep, eat and drink at the center's hotellike facility that has a pool table, compact disc player and television. There will be daily walks and some organized activities, but no monkey business allowed. `` We do n't want anyone to sneak a candy bar or a beer,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> originally wanted women for its study, but could n't find any takers. The study is intended to gauge the effect that a steady diet of fish has on keeping arteries free of blood clots.

 Not far from where Marine <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> ended his heroic march through the scorching <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> lies the shimmering ribbon of old Route 66. He nearly made it. Assigned to traffic duties during night desert maneuvers on Aug. 31, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> was to have been picked up by 1 p.m.. A communications foul-up left him stranded with three canteens of water, some dry rations and a poncho to protect him from the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, where temperatures soar beyond 110 degrees Nearly two days passed before a search for the 19-year-old Marine began. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the delay and why <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> was stranded by his unit of the 2nd Marine Division based at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Those matters, as well as why <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> was posted alone, will be raised during court-martial proceedings against <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s superiors `` The real issue is why it was 40 hours before we started looking,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The mistake of <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s superiors cost him his life. Two officers have been relieved of their commands as a result. Another officer and two sergeants face special courts-martial for charges of dereliction of duty. Meanwhile, the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> ordered his own inquiry to prevent a future tragedy. At some point during his ordeal, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> set out, marking an arrow with stones to point his direction as he marched south out of a canyon. Leaving two additional arrows, he turned north and began walking toward the highway that was once <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Route 66, the cross-country road of hope and despair described in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s novel, `` The Grapes of Wrath.'' `` Who knows how long he waited?'' said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Deputy Chief <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringhofer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ringhofer </PERSON> led the 160-member team that ultimately discovered <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s skeletal remains Dec. 4. Two earlier Marine-led searches yielded some of <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s equipment: a helmet, pack and flak jacket he abandoned on his way. `` We always advise that anyone in the desert or mountains stay put. But once he decided to move, he moved with direction and purpose,'' said <PERSON> Ringhofer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s bones, a wallet, his poncho, his clothing and an M203 rifle-grenade launcher were found near the community of <LOCATION> Bagdad </LOCATION>, less than a mile from old Highway 66 and just north of the boundary of the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> Twentynine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> training base, about 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He covered approximately 17 miles,'' <PERSON> Ringhofer </PERSON> said. `` He made a heroic effort, and he almost succeeded. `` He had to see the highway. You ca n't miss it.'' At the last, suffering from heat exhaustion and dehydration, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> took off his clothes and neatly folded them. He neatly folded his poncho. He was probably delirious. `` He removed all his clothing, all his gear. He walked away and wandered,'' <PERSON> Ringhofer </PERSON> said. `` At that point, it was over.'' The case is an unwanted first in an arm of the services that prides itself on taking care of its own. Of the tens of thousands of Marines who train every year at the <ORGANIZATION> Twentynine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> was the first lost to the blistering wasteland. `` It is beautiful and unforgiving country,'' <PERSON> Ringhofer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> defended the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>' initial failed search for <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>, citing the use of about 1,700 people, aided by aircraft, thermal heat imaging devices and the expertise of desert survival experts. The real issue in the case, he said, was how <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> was left unaccounted for, for nearly two days. `` The -LRB- commandant's -RRB- investigation is to try and determine how did all this happen,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. `` It has never happened before and we do n't want it to happen again.'' Last week, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> was buried with full military honors at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snelling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> near his hometown, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` He was proud of being a Marine,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` Every time he came home, he presented himself to his friends in uniform.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: A Peaceful Interlude But For How Long?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take over next month during a period of unusual international harmony, with both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> sounding increasingly moderate. Foreign forces are likely to begin withdrawing from southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and Soviet troops should be about to conclude their scheduled departure from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. These are good portents for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but history shows how ephemeral peaceful interludes can be. Just ask <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. It was just 10 years ago _ in December 1978 _ that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> could look out at the world with an air of confidence, able to boast three foreign policy breakthroughs that won him widespread, albeit temporary, admiration. Over a period of a few months, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> successfully guided the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties past a skeptical <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, reached agreement with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on the establishment of diplomatic relations and _ his most shining achievement _ spurred the Camp David breakthrough between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At the end of 1978, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s standing in the polls had risen to 50 per cent, high by standards of the time, and he seemed destined for a second term in the White House. Then came 1979, a year which ranks among the most disastrous endured by any president. The year began with the ouster of the pro-Western monarchy in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its replacement by an avowedly anti-American Islamic fundamentalist regime. It ended with the seizure of American hostages in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and their detention for 444 days. Indeed, the takeover of the American embassy there was part of a pattern of anti-American turmoil in Islamic countries in the fall of 1979. In the space of one month, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were attacked by mobs. Before the year was out, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, starting a downward spiral in superpower relations that was n't reversed for years. The invasion induced <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to slap a grain embargo on the Soviets, to withdraw from the 1980 summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and to shelve the SALT II treaty, which had been the centerpiece of a June summit meeting between <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. It seemed a new development buffeted the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration every month. Vietnamese troops occupied neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Leftists took control in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, paving the way for perhaps the most divisive foreign policy issue of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency: <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for the Nicaraguan Contras. Almost unnoticed at the time of the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was the collapse of a coalition government in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which in turn laid the groundwork for a civil war that claimed the lives of an average of 800 civilians a month in 1980. On the domestic front, the news for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was no better. By year's end, inflation reached 12 per cent, the result in large measure of a hefty midyear price increase decreed by the oil export cartel. There also was the widespread perception that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> looked foolish when his subordinates claimed to have `` discovered'' in the late summer of 1979 the presence of a Soviet brigade in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, only to concede later that the brigade had been there for years. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s showing in the polls dipped to 32 per cent in October after the brigade fiasco, reviving somewhat by year's end because of initial public support for his handling of the hostage crisis. But restiveness within the Democratic party over <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s performance was such that Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., decided in November 1979 to challenge him for the party's 1980 presidential <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> survived that challenge but lost 44 states in his re-election bid. He never recovered from the 1979 debacle. In contrast to that dismal era, the world nowadays seems downright tame. Being president seems easier than it did in 1979. Or was <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> just more fortunate than his hard-luck predecessor?

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has an opportunity to pull the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from the quagmire of purchasing scandals by appointing strong managers to monitor the weapons buying process more closely, analysts say. `` It's the best opportunity we've ever had,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official now with the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think tank. `` If someone goes in there with the right team and the right attitude, you can do more good for this country, in my view, than any secretary of defense.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated a desire to reverse the trend that has made household names of such scandal-ridden contractors as <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and has made the practice of defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> almost commonplace. The president-elect on Friday announced the appointment of former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Although Tower earned a reputation as a friend of military contractors during his years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and has worked for some of them in recent years, he bowed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oft-stated commitment to reform. `` The bottom line is that we must provide at least as much, if not more, defense for less money. And to meet that challenge, we must do several things. We must rationalize our force structure, we must refine and reform our management and procurement procedures, we must have biennial budgeting,'' Tower said. During the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> embraced the recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a panel appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to study ways to reform the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In its 1986 report, the commission proposed creation of an undersecretary of defense for acquisition, strengthening the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and having the president submit a two-year military budget for congressional approval. The panel was headed by former Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>. `` I favor the <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reforms,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told employees of a <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, plant in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, last October. `` The head of that commission, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, supports me for a good reason. He knows that I'm going to put his reforms into effect because I understand that those reforms ca n't be carried out piecemeal,'' the vice president said. During the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> relinquished control of the acquisition process to the various armed services, according to <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, who served as assistant secretary for manpower installation logistics from 1981 to 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already has acted on the commission recommendation to create the undersecretary position for acquisition. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> currently holds the post, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likely will name his own person to the job -- a critical selection, analysts said. `` For the administration to run a more effective bidding process, they must have top quality personnel,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Koswinsky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also approved reorganization legislation sponsored by former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., and the late <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a Democratic congressman from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> The law overhauled the upper echelons of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and designating the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> as the principal adviser to the president and the secretary of defense. `` Up until 1985-1986 ... <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> traditionally had prevented secretaries of defense from running that department because it was an alliance between services and these uniformed guys and these old barons on the Hill,'' <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> said. `` With the passage of <ORGANIZATION> Goldwater-Nichols </ORGANIZATION>, they gave the secretary of defense and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> ... the power to run it.'' The department Tower will run has been rocked by one scandal after another, culminating with a federal investigation this year into allegations of purchasing fraud and bribery involving government officials, military contractors and consultants. Targets of the two-year probe include <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a former assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary who became a consultant to several aerospace contractors immediately upon leaving the Pentagon. Some of the largest defense contractors, including <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had their offices searched, as did <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a top <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> acquisitions official. Among the other scandals: _ In December 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty to falsifying payment requests for defense contracts and paid a $ 1 million fine _ Reports circulated in 1984 that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 7,622 for a 10-cup coffeemaker used on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s C-5A cargo plane and $ 600 for a toilet seat cover _ In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its request for $ 491,840 from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> for the 76 trips <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the company's chairman, made from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, where he owned a The company later withdrew $ 23 million in bills. _ In 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors revealed that four former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe federal, state and city officials The four also pleaded guilty to grand larceny and bribery charges, conspiring to submit $ 5 million in phony government invoices and fraudulently passing off the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> as a minority-owned business. _ In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, manufacturer of electronic, mechanical and hydraulic systems for aircraft, pleaded guilty to four counts of defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by overbilling on aircraft parts The company also pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to mischarging on government contracts.

<HEAD>Reagan Officials At Odds On Weapons Plants Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says its new budget will contain enough money to run the nation's nuclear weapons plants safely, despite <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>'s warning of a $ 360 million shortfall that could lead to shutdowns. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, said Sunday that `` unobligated balances'' found within the department will make it possible to bring the facilities into compliance with safety and environmental laws. `` Mr. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> suggested that he wanted some additional spending rather than going into the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> resources and looking for some money, which we have done,'' <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said in an appearance on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet The Press.'' `` The president has said consistently we wo n't operate any of these plants unless we can operate them in a safe manner,'' he said. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> suggested in a Dec. 9 letter to <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> that the department might have to shut some of its plants unless the administration proposes more than the $ 12.9 billion planned for fiscal 1989. `` I must in good conscience advise you that ... the system will, in all likelihood, be operating beyond the bounds of acceptable risk,'' he wrote. Details of the letter were published in Sunday editions of The Washington Post. If the department gives priority to production rather than upgrading safety at the plants, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said in the letter, `` then unresolved environmental and safety issues are likely to lead to further shutdowns in the weapons complex.'' He said `` a significant increase in resources'' is needed over the next five years or the government will risk compromising the country's ability to produce and maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> told <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> in his letter that the department would use the last of an emergency contingency fund to pay for $ 200 million in improvements at its <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which has been plagued with safety and environmental problems. He also cited unforeseen expenses at Rocky Flats, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area plutonium processing facility with hazardous waste problems that are jeopardizing its operation, in explaining the expected $ 360 million shortfall. <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said he had sent a response to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. He did not indicate on the television program whether the unobligated money to which he referred was in the contingency fund or elsewhere, and did not say how much money had been found within the department. <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> said the department is in line for a $ 900 million budget increase next year, up from its current budget of $ 12 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operates 17 weapons plants. It has proposed spending $ 50 billion in the next 20 years to build new facilities and correct the most pressing environmental problems.

<HEAD>Outgoing Pentagon Chief Advises Tower to Stick to His Guns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> served in the job little more than a year, but he has some advice for his successor _ work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but do n't stop fighting for an increase in military spending. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also says former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> should n't turn the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on its head in the name of reforming the weapons-buying process, despite a string of scandals under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense industry needs stability and without it, the industrial base could collapse. He has called for a 2 percent increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget while President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, faced with a huge federal deficit, has talked of zero-growth. `` It's not a question of we ca n't afford it,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` If you look at the domestic programs, they continue to go up at a rate of about 8 percent. Therefore, using that yardstick, I see nothing wrong with 2 percent in defense,'' he said. Asked if he thought a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would go along with an increase, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> replied, `` If you do n't try it's not politically doable.'' The defense secretary said he thought Tower, a veteran <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, could make the case `` the world is coming our way'' in part because of a stronger military. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was interviewed last week in his Pentagon office as he awaited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement of the man who would replace him. There is no question Tower will have problems managing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracting, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. Indictments could be returned any day in the long-running <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud. `` But the last thing the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> needs is somebody to come in and yank the procurement system out by the roots again and say we're going to reform it or change it,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` The best reform for the procurement system is stability, predictability. The blueprint is laid out ... we've made a large number of changes in the procurement system. Real changes are taking place in the procurement system and I am proud of them.'' He said he had instituted a `` total quality management program'' to impress on contractors the need for quality products as well as ethical conduct. The 58-year-old defense chief said he was looking forward to finding a job in the private sector but had yet to do so. He listed among his accomplishments `` establishing a good rapport'' with his Soviet counterparts, protecting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and convincing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it was time to close unneeded bases. He said in addition to the Pentagon purchasing problems, Tower will have to help develop arms-control strategy and strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> while convincing <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies to resist `` the seductive appeal'' of Soviet arms-control proposals. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for the last 14 months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said he had enjoyed the position but found it truly was `` a full-time job.'' `` On a per-hour basis, I make about as much as my babysitter,'' he joked, adding the secretary's salary of $ 99,500 is `` lousy.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' decision to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is merely a first step into a baffling maze toward <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. Myriad thorny obstacles lie ahead and centuries of enmity must be surmounted. The competing claims of Arabs and Jews to the same lands are rooted in thousands of years of history. Many Israelis and Palestinians harbor the often justified fear that their foes would like them to forcibly disappear. It is a fear that makes every compromise a national trauma, seemingly a step toward national doom. Every Israeli recalls the vow of former <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukairy </PERSON> to `` drive <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into the sea.'' Every Palestinian recalls the contention of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s late Prime Minister <PERSON> Golda </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> that the Palestinian people `` do not exist.'' Both sides cherish the memories of thousands of heroes who died in the name of nationalism. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has now met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criteria for negotiation and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has begun talking with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders, despite nearly universal acknowledgement that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> represents the Palestinians, still refuse to deal with what they call a `` terrorist'' organization. Before any kind of peace talks can start, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s objections must be overcome _ or a way found to sugarcoat the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s bitter presence. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration has favored submerging the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> delegation to talks. It has also toyed with the idea of having the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> represented in talks by outside negotiators. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> rejects both plans. Israeli leaders have suggested staging limited elections to choose Palestinian negotiators from in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But the last elections there produced a clutch of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters, most of whom were deposed or deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Due in part to their year-long uprising in the occupied lands, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have won wide international acceptance of their call for a U.N.-sponsored peace conference. But the ground rules remain a major point of contention, even beyond the invitation list. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reject the Arab idea that a conference could force a solution if the parties themselves reach a deadlock. The Palestinians also say a conference should be based on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, which it seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, as well as creation of a Palestinian state. But even Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, a moderate <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader who favors some form of international conference, refuses to consider a total withdrawal from the occupied lands. And no <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader would even consider the key Arab demand that <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> be capital of the Palestinian state. The Israelis annexed the city's eastern Arab sector after seizing it in 1967. And what of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state? The Palestinians accept at least a period in which it would be demilitarized _ a nod to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security fears. And they call for confederation with moderate <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> _ an attempt to assuage <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> worries about a radical, independent actor on their flanks. Israelis and Americans, however, have tended to speak of such an entity as a province of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, or a sub-state whose police are overseen by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself. Such an entity would be located in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But roughly 70,000 Jewish settlers now live there _ and half the land has been confiscated or bought by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Much of the area's water, a commodity as precious as gold in the region, is already used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which would be hard-pressed to forfeit it. The Palestinians would find it difficult to thrive without it. More than 3 million Palestinians live in diaspora, and most claim legal rights to homes and lands in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or Israeli-controlled lands. The right of return they claim would cause shattering trauma in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. While many might remain in the countries that have sheltered them for 40 years, compensation would cost billions of dollars. And many would not accept. While the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> itself has agreed to live in peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a handful of splinter groups regard acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as tantamount to treason. Some Israelis who believe all of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> was promised to them by God would also object. Any peace settlement would almost certainly unleash terrorism by people desperate to sabotage it. Some leftist Israelis and some Palestinians see the answer in a confederation between the two feuding peoples themselves. And many Palestinians still cling to the hope that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, one day, will peacefully decide to merge with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. `` I ca n't even visit the family tombs in the yard of my house'' in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Hassan </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, who said he still hopes for such a peaceful road to a `` democratic, secular state.'' `` We ca n't have a democracy via violence,'' he said. For many Israelis, however, even a peaceful end to their state would be unthinkable.

<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> is leaving office firm in his conviction that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is doomed. `` In the long run, the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel can not survive,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said in a recent interview marking the end of his nearly four-year tenure. `` Cartels do not work. They have never worked in history.'' Several of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s larger members have new incentives to produce oil, rather than comply with last month's decision by the cartel to limit production to 18.5 million barrels a day. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> cited the following examples: _ <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has a major stake in the <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> chain of service stations and despite previous support of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation's `` future is here, not with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. _ <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is buying service stations and a refinery from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> `` and that's a major change. _ `` We've got two countries who have been at war for eight years -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> -RRB- with 40 to 50 billion dollars in war debt, and a reconstruction budget that is going to be horrendous, with one thing to sell _ oil.'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> contends that ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distribution facilities by overseas producers should be welcomed because of the incentives it gives producers to bring oil to market. `` It's good for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and it's good for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. No. 1, it's a guaranteed market for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and No. 2, it's a guaranteed supply for us,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. Those who fear a resumption of the oil shocks of the 1970s do n't realize `` we live in a fundamentally different world,'' he said In the first half of 1986, the oil industry was devastated by the collapse of crude oil from above $ 27 a barrel to less than $ 12 -LRB- measured by average refiner cost -RRB-. Half the 1,980 exploration rigs active in 1985 were idled and 120,000 out of 585,000 exploration and production jobs vanished. Crude oil now sells for about $ 15 a barrel. Imports have risen from less than 30 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption in 1985 to more than 40 percent now. At the same time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production has fallen by a million barrels of crude a day to a little more than 8 million barrels. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers of crude oil have pleaded for trade protection, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> maintained that quotas or tariffs would harm the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy more than they would help the oil industry. A tariff might be politically impossible anyway because of the demands for exemptions by <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> consumers, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the petrochemical industry plus the mandatory exemption for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> under the free-trade agreement, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said `` cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is not the solution,'' although he said he understood why <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> sent observers to the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` This is not an industry we can allow to go by the boards,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. He said he did not know just how big an industry the nation should try to preserve, but, `` I think it should be a lean, mean, efficient industrial part of our economy, which I think it is today.'' On other issues, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has to become more energy-efficient. The nation has made big gains in efficiency. The economy in 1987 was 40 percent larger than it was in 1973, but it used only 2 percent more energy. However, the gains are slowing down. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> use energy with twice the efficiency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` That's got to change. Now, is that the federal government's job? <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said. `` My position is, a lot of these problems are tax policy questions'' that will yield to `` tried and true'' tax incentives. Advocacy groups have blasted <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> and his predecessors under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for sharply curtailing spending on conservation, efficiency and renewable sources of energy. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> dismisses the criticisms. `` Are we spending enough money? I think we are. It's true we're not building the giant wind machines for $ 10 million any more, like Mod 2 and <ORGANIZATION> Mod </ORGANIZATION> 3, that we're reselling years later for $ 13,000. As for an environmentalist favorite, higher taxes on gasoline to discourage consumption, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> admitted that a big increase would do the job but said `` I stand foursquare with the president'' against more taxes.

<HEAD>Salmon Soar as Commercial Crop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Salmon production is soaring at fish farms worldwide, spurred in part by greater demand and buying power in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says. `` Worldwide salmon production is estimated up 75 percent from last year to over 300 million pounds,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the top producer, likely raised about 160 million pounds in 1988, almost double 1987's output.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> salmon farming, or aquaculture, is concentrated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and, most recently, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Last year's production was around 85 million pounds, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> salmon figures for 1988 are not available yet. Large Japanese demand and the strong value of the yen has boosted competition in world salmon markets, the report said. The heavy buying by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has reduced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply of top-quality salmon available to consumers, forcing some restaurants to remove salmon from their menus. `` A buying frenzy resulted from early reports of a small Alaskan catch coupled with losses in the Norwegian salmon crop because of a ` red tide' infestation of a microorganism that reduces the oxygen level of the water so the fish suffocate,'' the report said. Salmon farming makes up only a fraction of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture production, but some authorities believe the industry is poised for a major expansion, perhaps doubling or tripling domestic output in a few years. The report was prepared by economists <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, who are the agency's chief aquaculture specialists <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> salmon production figures are being studied and revised to get a more accurate picture of how much of the output goes into the commercial food supply. Also, he said, whether the current salmon boom continues will depend on many economic, legal and consumer factors. Overall, including food and non-food fish, shellfish and other aquatic products, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquacultural output rose by 20 percent in 1987 to almost 750 million pounds worth $ 650 million. The 1987 expansion was led by catfish, crawfish and salmon, with a combined production of more than 550 million pounds, or about 73 percent of the total. Catfish output was estimated at 370 million pounds; crawfish, 95 million pounds; and salmon, about 85 million pounds. But the report said that expansion probably will slow to less than 10 percent a year in the next 10 years unless new technology and more resources become available. `` A shortage of water supplies likely will impede expansion, particularly in areas where production is already highly concentrated,'' the report said. `` Where aquaculture is just beginning to develop, limited management resources, capital and industry infrastructure will constrain expansion.'' With a slower growth and little increase expected in the commercial catch of wild fish, Americans probably will depend increasingly on imports, which totaled $ 8.8 billion in 1987. However, the report added, this could be modified by new technology, growth of the commercial fishing fleet and shifts in consumer demand. The report noted some of the new research and technology in the industry: _ In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, research continues on lobster production, and in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> scientists are working with the black cod, a favorite in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ Striped bass, or rockfish, were in short supply following a ban on their catch three years ago in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the main production area The fish are now being produced in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, with production likely starting up next year in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. _ Oysters, littleneck clams, red fish and sturgeon are other species traditionally supplied from the wild catch that are now being farmed _ The development of genetically superior catfish and trout offers potential for expansion For example, <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has crossed a commercial blue catfish with the channel catfish to produce a hybrid with a 40 percent greater growth rate and a high tolerance for low-oxygen water.

<HEAD>Soviet Press Gave Hints of Coming Troop Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly four years after <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began his policy of greater openness, Westerners still search the Soviet press for subtle hints about what is going on in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. Close reading of an article buried in the inside pages of Sept. 16 editions of the main Soviet military newspaper warned <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers that civilians would be giving them more orders _ a strong hint that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> soon would be announcing troop cuts. Two weeks later, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> consolidated his power in the Kremlin. And on Dec. 7 he announced a decision that had been opposed by the military, a 10 percent reduction in the Soviet armed forces, including withdrawal of 50,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. One Kremlin-watcher is the former head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's super-secret <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, ret Lt. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>. He sees a strong link between the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> shakeup, in which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> demoted his conservative rival <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, and announcement of the troop cuts. At the same time that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced the troop cuts, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> spokesmen confirmed the resignation of a leading military opponent of unilateral Soviet reductions, Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, the chief of the Soviet General Staff. Both <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> made the mistake of publicly contradicting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and they paid the price. In July, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> had reasserted the class basis of international relations, undercutting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s bid to mend fences with the West. And in that same month <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news conference that the Soviets would not cut their forces unless the West did likewise. Both statements have assumed greater importance in retrospect than they were accorded at the time in the West. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, who published an article on `` Soviet Military Doctrine'' in the winter edition of Foreign Affairs magazine, said in a telephone interview it is not yet clear whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be able to change the deployment of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops sufficiently to reduce Western anxiety about Soviet offensive military capability. `` I am waiting with bated breath to see whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can make it stick,'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The situation as I see it is that the lines are drawn on the military issue between the General Staff and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reformers.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his civilian allies realize that the enormous sums the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> spends on defense are helping to cripple the rest of the economy. `` Today's Soviet forces are so large that one must ask why they have been created and deployed, `` wrote <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>. `` They overshadow not only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces but also exceed the combined forces within the Western alliance structure.'' Indications that Soviet civilian reformers were prevailing came in the Sept. 16 article in `` Red Star,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The article set off alarm bells for several reasons, among them the identity of the author, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kokoshin </PERSON>, a think-tank scholar who for more than a year has been leading a rhetorical assault against the pre-eminence of military officers in formulating national security policy. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is answerable to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s ruling Politburo, lower-level civilians previously had not been allowed a say in national security policies. The Soviet defense minister and his aides have traditionally been uniformed military officers, in contrast to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the top <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials are civilians and national security issues are publicly debated in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the press. In essence, <PERSON> Kokoshin </PERSON> said civilian scholars would be telling <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers which weapons they needed and how to use them, a domain that has always been firmly in the hands of uniformed officers. So, while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s theatrical announcement of the troop cut was seen as a diplomatic coup, the substance if not the timing came as no great surprise to those who read between the lines of Soviet newspapers. Western analysts began to pay serious attention to the military doctrine of `` reasonable sufficiency,'' which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> used as a rationale for the troop cuts, after a non-military Russian-language journal called <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations published an August 1987 article reassessing an important Soviet battle in World War II. The battle of Kursk, in 1943, was the largest tank engagement in history, and ranks with the more famous battle of <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION> as a decisive defeat for the Nazi invasion of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in World War II. The article concluded that a sound defense can defeat a blitzkrieg, and by implication, that the Soviets had no need to maintain a massive tank army of the kind now stationed in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Money Drain from Third World Nations Up This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Third World debt crisis will drain another $ 43 billion this year from nations that can least afford it, up from the $ 38.1 billion loss last year, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> says. This year's total is swollen by $ 31.1 billion leaving heavily indebted nations such as <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the bank said in an assessment issued Sunday. The outflow from Third World countries consists largely of debt repayments to commercial banks, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, other industrial countries and intergovernment lenders such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, money in the form of loans and investments tended to flow from the wealthy countries to development of the poor ones. The bank, which is owned by 151 countries with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holding the largest number of shares, said the report indicated that development and quality of life in many Third World nations may be taking a back seat to debt reduction. `` Although both incomes and consumption have fallen _ incomes in most highly indebted countries are lower today than a decade ago _ the adjustment burden has fallen mainly on investment,'' the report said. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, vice president and top economist at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said two messages emerged from the report: `` The first is that despite remarkably rapid growth in the industrialized world in 1988, growth in the debtor nations has not resumed. The second message is that the debt strategy is entering a new phase, in which debt reduction is playing an increasingly important role,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. The report raised the bank's estimate of Third World debt to $ 1.32 trillion at the end of this year. The total is expected to drop to $ 1.3 trillion in 1989. Debt has been growing more slowly because of changes in currency values, some agreements to reduce debt and the continued reluctance of commercial banks to make new loans. Average annual income in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> dropped to $ 1,630 last year from $ 1,990 in 1980, according to the bank. In African nations south of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, the average annual income fell from $ 570 in 1980 to $ 440 last year. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> urged governments of the creditor countries to encourage imports from the debtor nations. Debtor countries, meanwhile, should change their policies to encourage loans and investments, the bank said.

 At 13, Sharanne Au sees childhood passing by in a blur as she scrambles to excel in school and join what researchers call a cheerless, over-pressured, and sometimes suicidal generation of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> scholars. `` I am ordered by adults to hurry, to go faster and faster, to rush into adulthood while I am still a child ... `` We must be successful. Nothing else counts. Honesty, compassion, understanding are given lip-service, but all that counts is to be the best in material things ... There is schoolwork, extra-curricular work, homework, holiday homework and work to ` enrich' my life. They have taken away time,'' the schoolgirl wrote in a letter to a local newspaper. In this island republic of 2.6 million and throughout <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, youths are seeking psychiatric help in increasing numbers because parents relentlessly pressure them to achieve academic credits they hope will lead to the good life. Competition for university enrollment is hotter than in the West, in part because <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> has fewer colleges and in part because of the emphasis placed on education here. According to one survey from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION>, the number of new cases at the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> jumped from 677 in 1983 to 1,071 last year. Seven - and 10-year-olds talked of suicide because they could not cope with their studies `` To most of them, education was stress and pressure,'' said teacher <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Loh </PERSON>, chairman of the committee, which recommended reducing the emphasis on tests, widening curriculum and hiring full-time counselors at schools. Another study described the typical 19 - to 24-year-old in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> as out of shape, unappreciative of the arts, uninvolved with community service, and obsessed with high grades `` All of them equated a degree with a well-paying job and better standard of living,'' said civil servant <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Song </PERSON> <PERSON> How </PERSON>, whose committee conducted the survey. Educators blame the parents and parents blame the system, which begins separating children by academic levels at the age of nine. Tutoring has become a multimillion-dollar business, and some find work prepping kindergarten children. There are no dropouts in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> _ the official label is `` premature school leaver.'' One teacher said some parents also suffer from neurotic anxiety when children do not excel. `` It is not just the children losing the rat race, it is a reflection on their heredity,'' he said. When college admission examination results are announced, student suicides peak in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and several other countries. Failure is regarded as a stunning loss of face. About 9,700 Singaporeans study overseas, mostly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, compared to 15,000 at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION>. Some opt to go abroad to gain foreign credentials, but most of those who can afford it have little choice after failing to gain admission to <ORGANIZATION> NUS </ORGANIZATION>. The International Association for the <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Achievement </ORGANIZATION> said in an analysis issued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this year that students from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> scored best in four out of five science tests it conducted in 17 countries in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This appears to be partly the result of `` streaming,'' the phasing out of the less academically bright. Students in some countries have to choose between science and art when they reach 14. Those who pick science then concentrate almost exclusively on math, physics, chemistry, biology and computers. In <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, streaming starts at the end of third grade, when students are about nine years old, and further streaming takes place at the end of primary school. Education experts also ascribe the test results in part to parental pressure, based on stronger motivation linked to the the emphasis their cultures traditionally placed on learning, and the material and social rewards promised by a college degree. Families in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are pushing their children to learn too much too fast in their attempt to get their kids on the fast track, an official newspaper said recently. Parents have stopped teaching their children values, such as morality and the joys of labor, because they are spending too much time cramming their heads with facts, the paper said.

 The case of two fair-skinned firefighters who were hired under a minority preference plan after saying they were black has spawned citywide investigations of minority hiring and sparked debate. The strange case of 33-year-old twins <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> was not challenged until this summer, though the <ORGANIZATION> Malones </ORGANIZATION> have been with the department for 10 years. They were suspended from the department without pay in August for allegedly misrepresenting their race as a minority. They are awaiting an appeal of their case in the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, the racial backgrounds of 36 other firefighters have been investigated, according to department officials. Eleven firefighters, most who identified themselves as Hispanic, now face hearings but are still working. The Police Department was investigated as well, but no evidence of suspected minority misrepresentation was found. A review of the city <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is ongoing. The <ORGANIZATION> Malones </ORGANIZATION>, who live in suburban <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>, have refused to discuss their case publicly on the advice of their attorneys. Theporters. `` It all comes down to who says who is black and how black do you have to be,'' said <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>'s wife, recently. `` We're trying to be optimistic because they -LRB- the brothers -RRB- want their jobs back.'' The twins first applied to the Fire Department in 1975, identifying themselves as white. But their scores on the state civil service exam were too low on the grading curve for acceptance into the department. They took the test again two years later and this time identified themselves as black. They later explained that their mother told them in 1976 that their maternal great-grandmother was black. At the time, documentation was not required to back up their claim. By 1978, when the twins got their jobs, there was a minority preference plan for hiring in effect and their scores apparently were sufficient for them to be hired as minorities. The controversy over their claims to be black arose earlier this year when the twins took the lieutenant's exam and scored well, said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>. When state civil service officials returned the list of scores, the brothers were identified as black. <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> and Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, who both worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Malones </ORGANIZATION> in a station house, have said they never knew the <ORGANIZATION> Malones </ORGANIZATION> had been hired as minorities until they saw the indications on the lieutenant's exams. `` They look like ... 6-2 white guys, Irish guys, maybe a little German because they have blond hair,'' said <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> instituted a minority preference hiring plan after a federal judge ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 to bring minority representation up to levels comparable to the city's population. At that time, just 19 of more than 2,100 city firefighters were black or Hispanic. Today, the department is 21 percent black and <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON>, compared to 29 percent for the city's population. `` It's a very serious situation,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolling </PERSON>, who is black and who represents a predominantly black section of the city. <PERSON> Bolling </PERSON> had asked Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> to conduct a full investigation of minority hiring after the <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> case was publicized. `` The <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> brothers characterized themselves as black and took two positions that should have gone to minorities,'' he said. <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> said the department changed its guidelines after the <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> brothers were suspended, with incoming firefighters now required to furnish more documentation about their racial background. The state criteria for determining who should be designated as black for minority hiring purposes involves a three-part test: visual identification; documentary evidence; and evidence that the individuals consider themselves minority in the community. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> uses the first two parts. `` Part of the problem is that it's never really been defined just what a minority is,'' said <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>. `` We need to determine just what is a minority.''

 The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen today, and share prices fell slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 124.02 yen, down 0.08 yen from Friday's close of 124.10 yen The currency, which opened at 124.20 yen, moved within a range of 123.93-124 .33 yen A dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar-yen rate today hardly moved. `` The dollar slightly weakened toward the end of trading because of position adjustment,'' but it did not lead to a strong dollar-selling trend because `` the majority of traders are still expecting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate might be raised toward this weekend,'' she said. The 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION>, which lost 169.04 points Friday, dropped an additional 66.63 points, or 0.23 percent, to finish at 29,470.08. On Friday, the index closed at 29,536.71. The index rose 56.64 points in early trading but erased the gain in directionless trading without fresh market-affecting news in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, dealers said. Some market players were concerned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index for November, due out Tuesday, might be an indicator of whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would raise its discount rate, said a trader with a major securities firm. A dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said investors were staying on the sidelines amid concerns over a possible hike in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate.

 A past and present prime minister and a political newcomer were the candidates in today's election for president, the top government job. All are members of the country's Sinhalese ethnic majority Here are brief profiles: <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> _ The 64-year-old prime minister is the candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, headed by President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> who is barred by law from seeking a third six-year term. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> campaigned as the champion of the common man. Unlike most top Sri Lankan politicians who come from elite castes of society, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> was born in the slums of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and struggled to the top echelons of power. First elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1954, he has been <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s prime minister for the past 10 years. However, he has had his differences with his political mentor. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> was an outspoken critic of the 1987 peace accord <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed in an effort to end the insurrection by Tamil separatists. <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> _ Head of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> became the world's first woman prime minister in 1960.

She served as prime minister from 1960 to 1966 and again from 1970 to 1977 at a time when the post was still the most powerful job in government. Now 72, she says she would not return to the stringent economic controls and nationalization policies that led to her downfall more than a decade ago.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Soldiers Leave Cambodia As Part of Major Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 200 vessels carrying Vietnamese soldiers sailed past <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> on their way home today as part of a major troop withdrawal, the official Cambodian news agency reported. The <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> agency said about 10,000 people, including <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and military officers, lined the banks of the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to bid farewell to soldiers of Division 339. Red banners expressing gratitude to the soldiers were flying and many people waved miniature Vietnamese and <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> flags as the fleet passed, the agency said. An army band played songs praising Cambodia-Vietnam friendship and hundreds of schoolchildren and other people shouted slogans hailing the soldiers' service. The fleet then sailed southward for the 70-mile journey to the border of southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. A large group of foreign journalists invited to watch the pullout followed in helicopters. The agency said Cambodians bade farewell to other departing Vietnamese soldiers in ceremonies in <LOCATION> Ratanakiri </LOCATION> province in the northeast, in <LOCATION> Kampot </LOCATION> province south of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Kompong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cham </LOCATION> province east of the capital. The report monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> did not say how many troops were involved in the movements. The largest guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, called the movements mere troop rotations and said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had sent in fresh units by land and sea. The departing soldiers are among the 50,000 troops that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says are being sent home this year in its seventh annual partial withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> claims to have pulled out 32,000 troops already this year, and 18,000 more are to leave by land and water in a weeklong transfer ending Wednesday. Some Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> say they believe only 15,000 to 20,000 soldiers have left this year. The soldiers have been fighting a largely stalemated war against Cambodian guerrillas since massive Vietnamese divisions invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Christmas Day 1978 and installed the pro-Vietnamese government of President <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it will withdraw by 1990 the 50,000 troops that it says will remain after this week's pullout, leaving the fighting to <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON>'s forces. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said Friday that all Vietnamese military and civilian advisers have already left his country. `` This will not affect the balance of forces on the battlefield due to our <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> troops, who are in control of all areas from which the Vietnamese have withdrawn,'' he told a news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> said Vietnamese soldiers, not those of the Cambodian government, are engaged in `` tense, continuous fighting'' in the interior and along the western border with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. `` They have also ordered Vietnamese aggressor troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to disguise as <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> puppet soldiers,'' it said in a radio broadcast Sunday. The text was seen today. `` They have hidden these important combined units in areas that are inaccessible to foreigners and far from populated areas and strategic roads.'' Claims by the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which massacred hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion, are widely regarded as exaggerated.

<HEAD>A Small Private Plane Did Not Crash Into The Seine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For a while this morning, it looked like the end of the `` Black Baron,'' the mysterious pilot or pilots who have from time to time flown illegally over <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in small aircraft, violating the prohibition on low-level flights over the capital. Responding to urgent telephone calls from `` witnesses,'' police divers rushed to the scene and recovered the tail of an airplane from the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. But that's all there was. Only a tail. No body. From a plane that crashed two years ago. A hoax. The joke had officials running for several hours. The first call came about 3:30 a.m. from a person who told police that an aircraft was making low-level flights over the 15th and 16th districts of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on the south and west side. A series of similar calls were received by several police and security agencies. About 5:30, a `` witness'' reported he saw the wreckage of an airplane in the river between the Sevres and <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION> bridges. Several rescue teams were dispatched to the area. Divers pulled the tail of a plane from the water, but found nothing else. The tail of the plane showed signs of rust. After checking the identifying letters, GDPK, authorities discovered it belonged to an aircraft that crashed Aug. 28, 1987 west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Police, recognizing they had been had, say the tail of the plane obviously was thrown into the river by pranksters.

 Deposed Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who contends he is too ill to travel for arraignment on racketeering charges, will remain under round-the-clock care for congestive heart failure, his doctors said. An ambulance took <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> home Sunday from the hospital, where his doctors said medication and rest had controlled the life-threatening ailment. A court-appointed doctor concluded in late October that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was well enough to travel. It was not known whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' hospitalization would affect a court order requiring a trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for an arraignment Asked Sunday if the court would order another examination because of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' hospitalization, a spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said that he would have no comment. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in a stretcher Sunday afternoon. He did n't acknowledge reporters' questions as he was wheeled to an ambulance. Doctors said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' health had improved since he was admitted to the hospital Dec. 9, but his heart condition would require a doctor's supervision. `` Initially congestive heart failure is life-threatening, but his condition has stabilized,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' cardiologist `` His congestive heart failure has reversed itself. It could recur.'' <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has a history of congestive heart failure, which means the heart is unable to pump the amount of blood required by the body. `` The president is going home where we have set up a hospital setup,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' private physicians. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said he did not know the prognosis for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Test results wo n't be known for several days, he said. Neither doctor would comment on whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is too ill to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the court appearance. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> accompanied her husband to the ambulance, then climbed into the front seat of the vehicle for the two-mile trip to the couple's home overlooking <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since his ouster in a February 1986 civilian-military revolt. He and his wife were indicted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, accused of plundering their homeland's economy and stashing millions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the charges. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' legal team retained three physicians to examine <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and review the results of his hospitalization. He declined to name the doctors. The doctors' findings were expected to prove to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is too ill to travel, <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said Saturday. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cardiologist who examined <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> before his most recent hospitalization told a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that although the former president suffers from various ailments, he is well enough to travel. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> repeatedly faked pain during the three-hour examination, according to the doctor, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> indicated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not exclude <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from future peace talks provided <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declarations renouncing terrorism prove true. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> did not name <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in a television interview Sunday, but said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was prepared to talk with `` every Palestinian, no matter what his biography was, if he is not shooting and killing.'' He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will wait `` a month, a couple of months,'' to see if terrorism, including uprisings in the occupied territories, ends. Israeli officials have denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decision last week to hold a `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, strongly condemning a move that grants diplomatic credibility to a man Israelis accuse of masterminding a campaign of terror against the Jewish state. Terrorism played a large role in the first talks <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials held in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last week. The session took place after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last week met American conditions that included recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renunciation of terrorism. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, in the interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' appeared to step back from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to take part in talks that include <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. He linked such negotiations, however, to an end to violence in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in speaking against terrorism, has not included the stone-throwing and other acts carried out by Palestinians under Israeli rule. So far, 332 Palestinians have died in the year-old clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, including three who were killed today. And despite the movement towards peace talks, statements from other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials indicated violence was far from a thing of the past. <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, second in command <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> group, meanwhile, told an <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON> news conference that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s denunciation of terrorism last week `` did not include military attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Our struggle will continue until we raise the Palestinian flag over <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said in the television interview, `` I shall say, very clearly, I am ready to sit with every Palestinian who is not engaged in terror, who is seeking peace and who wants to negotiate the peaceful solution with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Asked whether that included sitting down with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, he said, `` I am not ready to refer to a single person because I do n't think that's the issue. But I am saying, in a very clear way, with every Palestinian, no matter what his biography used to be.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> added he has `` doubts about Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>.'' But he said, `` I am ready to sit with every Palestinian, no matter what his biography was ...'' `` If Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> says, ` I'm going to stop violence and terror,' okay, let's wait a month, a couple of months and see if this is really going to happen,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. It was unclear from the comments whether that view would carry over into a new Israeli government. Talks between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' Labor Alignment and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> over a new government have broken down, leaving <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aides talking about forming a new governing coalition with ultra-orthodox Jewish parties.

 Here are some facts and figures about <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 LAND _ <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> is an island of 25,332 square miles, about the size of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, off <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern coast. It was known as <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION> until 1972 and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> traders of long ago called it <LOCATION> Serendip </LOCATION>, or the Land of Pleasant Surprises. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> means `` bountiful island' in the Sinhala language.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PEOPLE _ The breakdown of the island's 16 million population is: 75 percent Sinhalese, 18 percent Tamil, 7 percent Moslem and a few descendants of European settlers. The Sinhalese, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, and Tamils, most of whom are Hindu, came from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> centuries ago across the narrow <LOCATION> Palk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HISTORY _ Since ancient times, the island was invaded by the armies of Indian kings. The Portuguese colonized it in the 16th century, the Dutch ruled in the 17th century and the British were in control from about 1800 until independence in 1948. Battles between Sinhalese and Tamils are rooted in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s history, but the basis for the current civil war was laid by British encouragment of minority Tamils in education and jobs under the `` divide and rule'' policy After independence, the Sinhalese tried to contain Tamil influence. A law passed in 1956 declared Sinhala as the official language. Tamil riots began and resentment grew of Sinhalese dominance in government, the military and education. The problem was excerbated by the religious difference. The civil war began when Tamil rebels killed 13 Sri Lankan soldiers in 1983, setting off riots in which more than 1,000 Tamil civilians were killed.

<TEXT>
 A group of homosexual Roman Catholics and their supporters sang songs and prayed during a march to protest their eviction from the last parish church in a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city in which they were allowed to meet. Holding hands, singing traditional church hymns and carrying crosses and lighted candles, about 500 people marched a mile from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boniface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> after an `` exodus service'' to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday night `` The church has been my father, my family, for much of my life, particularly after my physical family rejected me for being gay,'' said sobbing marcher <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Koerner </PERSON>, 31. `` Now I'm doubly an orphan.'' Leaders of Dignity _ a 20-year-old organization of homosexual Catholics with 100 chapters and 5,000 members nationwide _ portrayed their eviction as a gift from God. It was brought about by their refusal to endorse church teaching that homosexuality is immoral. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonergan </PERSON> of Dignity told the congregation `` to stay would have meant for us to accept self-hatred and self-doubt.'' The local Dignity branch had sponsored a Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boniface </ORGANIZATION> for 15 years, but Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> on Dec. 3 banned the group from all church property after Sunday. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said a special Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday evenings would be offered as an alternative for the Dignity branch's 350 regular members Catholic officials across the country have ousted Dignity groups from parish churches in nearly 40 cities during the last two years because of the 1986 reaffirmation by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> that homosexuality is an `` intrinsic evil'' and is incompatible with <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> dogma. At the final <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boniface </LOCATION> service, the Rev. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Arpin </PERSON>, who has AIDS, said the ouster challenged the group to accept persecution as <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> did. `` To us, God is giving the holy task for being in this world filled with hatred, prejudice and death to teach the world to love again,'' <PERSON> Arpin </PERSON> said. `` We, whose love we are told is perverted.'' To cheers and applause, <PERSON> Arpin </PERSON> told the crowd it was sending `` a clear message to the church in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>: Like us or not, we are your sons and daughters, your priests and nuns, your faithful ones. We are the church.'' By sponsoring its own Mass, Dignity was able to get priests to give talks reflecting its views, not necessarily the church's, on homosexuality and other issues. Monsignor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Dignity was the group's last branch in a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> city that was still being allowed to use church facilities. Dignity services are being held in churches in a few small cities in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but neither the church nor Dignity would identify them.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and Chinese leaders spent most of their time together today discussing their troubled border, the main issue dividing the world's most populous nations, Indian journalists said. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also discussed <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and trade with his Chinese hosts. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s premier, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, met for two hours in the morning following <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s arrival from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. They continued meetings after lunch, said the journalists who attended a news briefing closed to non-Indian reporters. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s five-day visit marks the first time an Indian leader has come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1954, when his grandfather <PERSON> Jawalharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The last time Chinese and Indian leaders met was in 1960, when Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> Enlai </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Two years later, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> fought a war over the border and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> occupied a large chunk of Indian territory. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> flew into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> accompanied by about 100 top officials and the two nations were expected to sign agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and technology. Consular offices in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> may also be established. Little progress was expected on the 2,400-mile border. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and Indian journalists said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> agreed that the two nations had to find a way of settling the border question peacefully. `` We should work now toward resolution of the border issue while we work at the same time to expand and strengthen our bilateral relations,'' the journalists quoted <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said the border problem was hindering the two countries' relations, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> also said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> expressed `` admiration'' for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s position on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> province bordering <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has reiterated that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and forbids Tibetan refugees in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> from engaging in political activities. In 1959, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s leader, and thousands of Tibetan refugees fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after an abortive, anti-Chinese uprising. On Dec. 10, at least one monk was killed in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> during a clash between Chinese troops and Tibetans who seek an end to 38 years of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> rule. It was the third bloody clash in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> in 14 months. Earlier Monday, at the Great Hall of the People in downtown <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was given a 19-gun salute and met by Premier LI. Indian and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> flags lined <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, colored flags lined the city's main boulevard, <LOCATION> Changanjie </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> soon after <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s 1949 revolution. In the early 1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and personal and political disagreements between <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> and Prime Minister Nehru. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now claims 36,000 square miles of Indian land. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> rejects the claim and demands that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> return the 15,200 square miles it took in the war. In the late 1970s, relations improved slightly when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began emphasizing traditional state-to-state relations instead of exporting socialist revolution. Direct trade resumed in 1977 but it amounted to just $ 150 million in 1986-87 with few prospects for growth. The two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little progress in eight rounds. Interviews with Chinese scholars over the weekend found them pessimistic about the possibility for good Sino-Indian ties. For one, they said, the economies of the two countries are too similar to allow for much trade. `` They export textiles and we export textiles. They want high technology and we want high technology,'' said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Minqiu </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're competitors so we lack cooperative spirit.'' In addition, Chinese researchers said the border question appears intractable. `` In some of the areas that we claim, the Indian government has made big investments and has registered good economic growth,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON>. `` It's very hard to see them giving it up.''

 A teacher who disarmed a student accused of killing one teacher and wounding another said he thought it was a prank when he first saw the teen-ager wielding a semiautomatic handgun. `` I thought it might be one of those Uzi-type water pistols,'' <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchins </PERSON> <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> said. `` Then the glass was shot out and I knew it was a reality.'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, 16, allegedly shot the window out of a locked classroom door at <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to reach a student he wanted to kill. `` My original thought was, ` Oh my God, I'm going to be shot,'' <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> said about the Friday incident. `` Then I remembered I had 38 students in there.'' So <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> stretched his arms in an effort to shield as many students as possible while pleading with the teen-ager not to shoot. `` I cried out to him, ` No, no, do n't do it. This is no way. Please do n't do this,''' <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> said. Police say <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> fired two shots, including one that narrowly missed <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON>, before his Cabray M-11 pistol jammed. <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> tackled <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and held him down while student <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> grabbed the gun, a cheap imitation of a combat assault weapon. `` I've never been in a situation where I had to fight for my life,'' said <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON>, 24. `` I thank God for giving me the presence of mind and the physical ability to get the job done.'' Police say that by the time <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> reached <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON>'s Bible class, he already had killed <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, 40, and wounded <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, 37. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> was in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Sentara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> had gone to Ms. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>'s classrooms in search of a student who had been tormenting him `` I think it's a classic case of the school bully vs. a meek and mild kid and the boy finally got fed up with it and just snapped,'' a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> detective told The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star. The newspaper reported Sunday that authorities were saying privately that racial insults may have ignited the boy's anger. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> is one of four blacks in the student body of 510. Principal <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he was unaware of any racial friction, but he could not rule it out. `` Let's face it, we're dealing with kids and sometimes they go at it,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Police were at a loss to explain why the student shot Ms. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who was alone in her portable classroom. Authorities said that moments after that shooting, the youth went to <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>'s classroom about 50 feet away and showed him the pistol. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> told the boy it was against the rules to bring a gun to school and asked for the weapon before being shot in the shoulder. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> is being held on charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder, malicious assault, use of a firearm in a felony and firing into an occupied building. Relatives and friends have described <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> as a quiet loner with an affinity for guns. He spent most of his time playing with his pet pigeon, watching television and reading gun magazines.

<TEXT>
 More than 100 activists, from farmers to artists, have joined forces to create a united voice for the mainstream opposition and say their first goal is legalization of Solidarity. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, chairman of the free trade union movement, convened the group Sunday. Previously, it had been an informal council that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had gathered five times since May 1987 to make broad policy statements on the behalf of the opposition. The so-called Citizens Committee, comprising 128 intellectuals, Solidarity supporters, opposition activists, farmers and artists, is intended to bring together disparate elements in a united voice of opposition. The participants have in common a willingness to negotiate with the government. Groups such as the Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which urge independence and the removal of the communist system, were not included. Government-controlled radio and television reported the formation of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, signaling at least tacit acceptance of the organization. In its first statement, the group said Solidarity's reinstatement is `` of crucial importance. ... Without such a decision a sufficient and credible structure for reform will not be created.'' The committee will meet four times a year and establish 15 commissions to examine specific social needs and suggest solutions, leaders said after a daylong conference in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Incorporated into the structure are commissions of opposition experts who have been preparing, at <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s request, to take part in talks with the government. Still, there are no new signs when those talks might take place, said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> who spoke for the committee. Communist authorities promised negotiations with the opposition as a condition for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s help in ending a wave of strikes in August, but they have repeatedly delayed the talks. <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON> said members of the group see the talks as only one means for beginning dialogue with the government. He said the dialogue could take other forms, through the commissions. The commissions were organized for various topics. Among them: political and economic reform, education, housing, national minorities, culture, youth and ecology. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has confirmed continuing low-level contacts between the opposition and authorities in recent weeks, but would say nothing about the content of the discussions. On the surface, relations between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the authorities have never been so cordial since Solidarity was crushed in a 1981 military crackdown and outlawed the following year. In the past month, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has been allowed to speak his mind without censorship in a national television debate, was permitted his first foreign trip since Solidarity's heyday and has seen his public statements and activities broadcast and even praised in the official media nearly every day. On Thursday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said recent remarks by government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> have come `` very close'' to Solidarity's demand for a statement of intent to reinstate the organizaton. Solidarity has asked for such a declaration as a condition for starting formal talks with authorities on tackling <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s daunting social and economic problems.

Radio reports monitored in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> indicated a total of 16 politicians were under arrest.

Under <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>'s constitution the president can only be removed on the vote of an electoral college made up of politicians and regional leaders. <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON>, in an interview today with an Australian radio station, admitted his action was unconstitutional. `` I believe I took the correct action although it was against the constitution,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I put it his way, why should I wait for the advice of the government when I know that things are not really going well.'' <PERSON> Sope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lini </PERSON>, who helped found the republic of <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> in 1980 from the former Anglo-French <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hebrides </LOCATION>, have been fighting for control of the government for a year.

 A cracked pipe at one of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>'s nuclear reactors will be replaced before the reactor is allowed to restart, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjostrom </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s acting assistant manager for reactor operations, said replacing the pipe would not delay the restart scheduled for this summer `` because we have the time to do it ... and especially because it's a smaller pipe.'' All three <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> reactors have been shut down since summer for safety improvements and maintenance. They are the nation's only source of tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons. Because tritium decays 5.5 percent annually, some federal officials say the nation could face forced reductions in nuclear weapons unless the reactors are restarted soon. <PERSON> Sjostrom </PERSON> said the crack in the 4-inch pipe occurred in an area where two pipes join, the <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> -RRB- Chronicle reported in Sunday's editions. The pipe supplies cooling water to reactor control rods which are raised and lowered within the reactor vessel to control the fission process. <PERSON> Sjostrom </PERSON> said the crack was detected Friday by ultrasonic tests during a routine check of the reactor's piping.

 Three <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> narcotics detectives suspended following the fatal beating of a suspected drug dealer were on a police department list of officers frequently involved in violent arrests, according to a report published today. Detectives <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Veal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> were named in a July 1988 `` Early Warning System'' memo, which lists officers who have five or more extraordinarily violent arrests in two years, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported. The men were among eight taken off duty with pay during the investigation of the beating death of <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> `` Cano'' Mercado, police said. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, whose eight `` Early Warning'' incidents was the second highest of the 22 officers on the list, had reputedly been targeted for assassination under a contract taken out by <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, police said. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> promised a swift investigation of the Friday evening beating. `` There are serious issues that must be investigated,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said at a news conference Sunday. `` I do n't know how to express to you how we feel, how my administration feels. We are really saddened by this incident.'' <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, 35, died just days after <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police received an anonymous tip that he had put out a murder contract on <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>. `` This thing was just a frenzy,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON>, a police spokesman. He said <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> died of internal bleeding caused by `` blunt trauma to the torso.'' Charges against the officers could include murder, he said. Six undercover officers, all members of a special unit set up to fight street drug sales, confronted <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> outside a relative's home while on duty Friday, police said Witnesses said the officers took <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> inside his relative's home, shut the door and pulled a curtain closed The officers did n't have an arrest warrant, police said <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> died Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> said the department decided to suspend the six officers and two supervisors after an autopsy Saturday. On Friday, police had said <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> was injured in a struggle that broke out when three officers approached him for questioning and he ran into the house and tried to grab a knife. On Saturday, <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> said a knife had been found, but he could not say whether <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> had brandished it. Police records show that from 1980 to 1988, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> was arrested 16 times on charges including drug offenses, assault and attempted murder, but the outcome of the charges was not immediately known. Also relieved of duty were Detectives <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, all of whom were at the scene Friday, police said. The drug squad's leader, Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, and Sgt. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Orosa </PERSON> were suspended and accused of failing to protect a crime scene and allowing key witnesses _ the six detectives _ to leave the scene.

 <LOCATION> CAGNES-SUR-MER </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Two explosions ripped through a four-story residence for immigrant workers in this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> town early today, killing one person, injuring a dozen and seriously damaging the building, police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The anti-racism organization SOS-Racism, issued a statement saying it was `` deeply shocked and indignant over this murderous attack.'' The first blast pulverized a car parked at the entrance of the building, which housed 97 people, mostly North African immigrants. Pieces of the car were thrown as far as 300 feet away and the concussion broke windows in area buildings. Four other cars also were destroyed and numerous vehicles damaged. Residents of the building were evacuating rapidly when a second explosion occurred in the stairwell, police said. `` We were drinking coffee with a colleague when the explosion blew out the door and all of the windows,'' said an employee of a transportation company next door to the residence. `` We ran outside and we saw that terrified residents of the center wanted to jump from the windows. `` We shouted to them to remain in the building and we approached it to help them. It was at that moment that the second explosion happened. I was thrown 10 meters and my colleague was hit full in the head by a piece of flying metal.'' The dead man was identified as <PERSON> Georghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Yordachescu </PERSON>, 50, a Romanian immigrant who worked as a delivery driver and had lived at the residence for about four years. Six of the injured required hospitalization and were taken to facilities in <LOCATION> Cagnes </LOCATION> or nearby <LOCATION> Antibes </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cagnes-sur-Mer </ORGANIZATION> is about six miles west of <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. The ground floor of the building suffered severe damage. Dozens of rooms were devastated and enormous pieces of concrete were thrown in all directions just as residents were fleeing the building. Some of the injured suffered broken bones and cuts. Some had jumped from the windows. After an initial panic, the surviving residents regrouped around a fire built in front of the building. `` We never received any threats,'' one of them said. `` Everything was just fine at the center. We do n't understand this attack. The prefect, or local governor, of the area, <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pensa </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauvaigo </PERSON>, mayor of <ORGANIZATION> Cagnes-sur-Mer </ORGANIZATION>, went to the scene to begin arranging emergency measures to house the survivors.

 An 11-year-old Palestinian boy died today from head injuries that his family says he suffered when he was pushed from a military jeep in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokesman said he was checking the report, but he said an earlier investigation found no evidence the child was taken away by soldiers in a jeep. Palestinians shut shops and schools on the third day of a general strike throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At least eight towns and refugee camps that were the scenes of violence Sunday were under curfew, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. Palestinian doctors said <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> <PERSON> Karada </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> died at east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> from injuries to the head suffered Dec. 10. They said relatives told them he was pushed from a military jeep after being detained by troops. In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said today the yearlong uprising in the occupied territories will continue, but he said he wants <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> help in drawing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. His visit was seen as part of his campaign to drum up international backing for a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. A total of 332 Palestinians have died in the uprising. Thirteen Israelis have been killed. Left-wing Israelis announced they formed a human rights group to monitor abuses in the occupied territories. The group was named <PERSON> Betzelim </PERSON>, `` Image'' in English. `` We formed the group to save the human image of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, that's why we chose this name,'' <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamor </PERSON>, one of the founders, said in an interview She said the organization of about 60 leftist authors, journalists and lawyers would collect affidavits and statements about abuses, as well as lobby <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about human rights violations. The attorney general ordered an investigation into a complaint by two brothers from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Taibe </LOCATION> who claimed they were severely beaten by agents of the Shin Bet security service, the Maariv daily reported. <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabli </PERSON> said they were beaten while detained on charges of illegal possession of weapons, the newspaper reported. The strike paralyzed public transportation and commerce in major towns and cities throughout the occupied territories. Most schools were reported closed, and some youths were seen persuading other students to boycott classes. The three-day strike was called by leaders of the Palestinian rebellion after soldiers fatally shot five Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> on Friday, one of the bloodiest days of the uprising. The army commander in charge of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> defended the troops for opening fire on protesters in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. `` The troops were caught in ambushes of masked youths throwing rocks and they were forced to open fire to protect themselves and carry out their mission,'' said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>. `` There may be some who think it is legitimate to throw rocks, but wheover takes upon himself to attack Israeli troops should not be surprised to get hurt,'' he said. Also today, a group of Jewish settlers staged a sit-in outside the military government headquarters in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> to protest numerous stoning attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> vehicles in the area, Israeli radio stations reported. Soldiers blocked some of the settlers from entering <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, a city of 40,000 that was under curfew, and detained 15 settlers, army radio reported.

 An apologetic man hijacked a limousine carrying a bride-to-be and her bridesmaids, but got the crying women to the church on time before he fled in the expensive car. `` When you get married you can never predict what's going to happen,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moccia </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, `` and today's events were a good indication of that.

For the ride to the reception, police offered their services, carrying the wedding party to suburban <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> in their patrol cars. `` The bandit got them to the church on time, but the police got them to the reception on time,'' said Detective <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>.

 An army helicopter searching for a deserter crashed in the Andean foothills in southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, killing three officers, newspapers said today. <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspapers cited unofficial sources as saying a colonel, a major and a captain aboard the aircraft were killed when it crashed on Sunday. A fourth occupant, an army mechanic, survived the accident and was hospitalized in serious condition, the reports said. According to the reports, the helicopter, a French-made Lama, was involved in a manhunt for a deserter from the army's 26th Regiment based near the city of <LOCATION> Coyhaique </LOCATION>, about 1,300 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. The deserter reportedly was armed with an automatic rifle and hand grenades Although no official army version of the crash was released, the reports blamed the crash on heavy winds. Also on Sunday, an army lieutenant and two corporals were injured in the bombing, apparently by leftist terrorists, of a highway bridge on the country's main north-south highway 260 miles north of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. The officers were crossing the bridge in a car when the explosion occurred, authorities said. The blast badly damaged the bridge, and forced authorities to detour traffic.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials have agreed to his proposal for an international telethon to raise money for earthquake victims in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, including funds to rebuild churches. `` It is significant that -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has dispatched a minister of culture,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` And that is a significant breakthrough, that they would allow us to rebuild churches, the center of hope for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also called for federal laws to help the homeless in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In a joint news conference Sunday with Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the telethon would be broadcast on television in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with toll-free telephone numbers provided in each country to accept donations. It is tentatively planned for February. Entertainers <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> have expressed interest in the project, and Soviet entertainers would also participate, he said. Telethon proceeds would be used `` specifically to help rebuild churches in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, to rebuild schools and to rebuild hospitals,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Later in the day, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attended a midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> rally against homelessness and told the crowd of marchers, estimated at more than 5,000, that failure to provide people with a home should be made a federal crime. `` We must make denial of the right to a house a federal crime,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` It must be illegal. ... We must join hands and march to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by the tens of thousands and put housing legislation on the books in the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Organizers bused in 2,000 homeless people from shelters and welfare hotels around the city to join the protesters who marched in the bitter cold along 57th Street, one of the city's fanciest shopping thoroughfares. `` These streets suggest great wealth but people on other blocks are freezing to death,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, spokesman for Housing Action Week, the coalition that organized the rally and six days of events that preceded it. Organizers chose the week before Christmas to hold the march, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> said, because `` this is the time of year when we celebrate the birth of a homeless child to a homeless family.'' Just as `` there was no room at the inn'' for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, he said, many poor families in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are also homeless.

 Nearly 8,000 people were evacuated from cities and towns shattered by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s earthquake as authorities began trying to clear the area of all but workers involved in the cleanup effort, Pravda reported today. Another 4,500 mothers and children were expected to leave today for <LOCATION> Anapa </LOCATION>, a Soviet children's resort in the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. Within two to three days, only men involved in the reconstruction should remain, it said. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, the 1979 Nobel Peace laureate, today offered the Soviets the assistance of her religious order, the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION>, which operates orphanages, hospitals, food centers and schools in more than 25 countries. The Roman Catholic nun met in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> with Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, who `` warmly thanked her for the kind feelings, compassion, and the offered aid,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say whether the Soviets agreed to accept help from her order. In the past, churches and religious groups have been barred from engaging in public assistance or operating hospitals, schools and other social services. The Soviets say they have received $ 100 million in earthquake aid from a total of 77 countries. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to allow Armenians to call collect to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where many have friends and relatives. Soviets usually can not place collect calls. The official news agency said Saturday that since the quake, telephone traffic between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has increased eight-fold. Armenians `` whose senses have been dulled by grief'' still hope to find survivors under collapsed homes and apartment buildings, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday, 11 days after the earthquake that killed an estimated 55,000 people. `` We must hurry! _ these words are now in the souls and on the lips of thousands of people who are helping liquidate the consequences of the tragedy,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a report on Sunday's meeting of a special Politburo commission overseeing the relief effort. There were no reports of survivors being found Sunday or today. Pravda said 15,252 people were dug out alive from the rubble in the first 10 days after the Dec. 7 quake. More than 23,000 bodies have been recovered, but that is less than half the total believed buried in piles of stone and concrete dust that were once the cities of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kirovakan </PERSON> and up to 100 villages. `` The smell is becoming more and more pronounced every day'' in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, where 15,000 of the city's 25,000 are believed dead, said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurchenko </PERSON>, a photographer for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The first sign of the terrible threat of an epidemic _ dead dogs and swarming rats _ are forcing rescue teams to hurry, since no leveling of the town can be done with corpses still remaining in their stone graves,'' he said. The city was nearly deserted, with a few people searching for relatives remaining behind and taking shelter in garages, <PERSON> Yurchenko </PERSON> said. Snow and temperatures below freezing hampered relief efforts and posed additional hardships for thousands of people left homeless. `` The first, most acute phase of the rescue effort is coming to an end,'' Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said. `` Preparations have started for restoring the industries and housing.'' There has been no official announcement of an end to the search for survivors, a potentially explosive issue in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> where some people have sat in front of bulldozers to prohibit clearing of rubble until it can be searched for victims. `` Hopes for saving them are slim,'' the Politburo commission concluded Sunday. `` But no matter how hard it is, no one has the right to start fully clearing the grounds of factories and plants until that operation is complete.'' Armenian activists, embittered by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s refusal to grant their demands in a territorial dispute with neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, have accused the central government of not doing enough to warn Armenians of the danger of an impending earthquake and of bungling relief efforts. Soviet media continued to report on an official crackdown against Armenian militants, including members of the <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> committee, six of whose leaders have been arrested. The committee has spearheaded the 11-month-old campaign for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian enclave in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said members of the committee had mounted `` continuous onslaughts'' on authorities since the earthquake and handed out leaflets calling for strikes and demonstrations.

He said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, an ally of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, felt it could not ignore the `` splendid economic growth'' of more than 40 million South Koreans. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> signed a contract last week to extend a $ 65 million commercial loan to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Another contract will be signed later to provide <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with $ 60 million in loans from a consortium of eight South Korean banks, government officials said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s links with other communist countries also have grown considerably in recent years. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and several other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc coutries have either opened or agreed to open trade missions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. More than 1,000 businessmen from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> visited communist nations in the first half of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to change trade and investment regulations it views as obstructing effective economic cooperation with communist nations, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting unidentified government sources. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON> said the government also will amend trade-related regulations, including import procedures, participation in international biddings and exhibitions. The government now allows only one South Korean business at a time to participate in biddings offered by communist nations. A competitive bidding system among South Korean firms will be considered, the agency said. The South Korean diplomatic links with the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc represent a major setback for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since 1945, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops ended the Japanese occupation of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The two sides fought the bloody Korean War in 1950-53. The president said he would continue to seek summit talks with his North Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. The summit, if held, would be the first since the division of the peninsula.

 Four people, including a teen-ager shopping for Christmas gifts, were killed and 13 were wounded over the weekend in attacks police linked to gang violence. A 15-year-old boy was killed Sunday night in <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, about 20 miles southeast of downtown. The teen-ager, who was not identified pending notification of relatives, was standing on a sidewalk when a car with five males stopped and yelled to him, police Deputy <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahla </PERSON> said. When the youth approached the car, he was shot with a shotgun, <PERSON> Wahla </PERSON> said. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. Earlier Sunday, a man bearing gang tattoos was stabbed to death in <LOCATION> Pacoima </LOCATION>, an unincorporated area 20 miles northwest of downtown in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Detectives said the victim's attackers escaped. Two alleged gang members were booked for investigation of murder after a teen-age bystander was killed in a gang shooting inside a crowded shopping mall in <LOCATION> Panorama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpuche </PERSON>, 16, of <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuys </PERSON>, who was not known to be a gang member, was hit by a bullet in the chest Friday while shopping for Christmas presents in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> mall. He died the next day. Arrested in the shooting were two young men, ages 22 and 18, both believed to be gang members. Also arrested was a 16-year-old, police said. The fourth gang killing occurred Friday night when <PERSON> Terrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was gunned down by rival gang members as he walked with his girlfriend. She was unhurt. Two gang members were wounded by rivals early Sunday. Nine people were wounded in five separate shootings Saturday night. Earlier Saturday, two <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> teen-agers were wounded in a drive-by shooting. At least 325 people have been killed in gang violence in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> this year, up from 284 in all of 1987.

 Sinhalese extremists armed with machine guns and bombs attacked at least four polling places in today's presidential voting, killing at least 15 people as others stayed home due to threats of violence, officials said Hundreds of people have been killed in the weeks leading up to the elections in violence triggered by ethnic divisions, and all three presidential candidates have vowed an end to the bloodshed. At least 25 people were wounded today when the extremists, who had threatened to kill anyone who cast ballots, fired guns and hurled bombs at voting stations in the Sinhalese heartland, police and military officials said. Election officials said the threats and violence kept many Sri Lankans from the polls. Troops and police had been deployed throughout this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> nation in an effort to assure calm balloting. `` This is a battle between the ballot and the bullet,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, 64, candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said after voting in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. `` The bullet must not win.'' Polls closed at 4 p.m. today, but results were not expected until Tuesday. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s main rival was a former prime minister, <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, 72, of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonasekera </PERSON>, 38, campaigned as the alternative candidate to the two main parties and ran with the support of a coalition of four small leftist parties. Deputy Commissioner of Elections <PERSON> Lakshman </PERSON> <PERSON> Perera </PERSON> estimated 50 percent of the 9.3 million eligible voters turned out, well below the 80 percent who voted in the 1982 election. He said election violence and threats by Sinhalese extremists kept many people away from the polls. All three candidates are Sinhalese, the mostly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> ethnic group that comprises 75 percent of the population. Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the population. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a shadowy Sinhalese extremist group, called for an election boycott and said it would kill anyone who voted. It claimed balloting under the government of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> would not be fair. It also vowed to kill government supporters after <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed an accord in July 1987 that granted some autonomy to Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland and allowed Indian troops into the country to try and keep peace. Officials blamed today's attacks on the front. They said gunmen in a jeep killed three voters and wounded 15 at <LOCATION> Matala </LOCATION>, about 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Another three voters, a soldier and a policeman were shot to death near <LOCATION> Polonnaruwara </LOCATION>, 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, and three voters were hurt in another attack in the same area, they said. Three voters were killed by a bomb in <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>, 88 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the officials said. A policeman died in an ambush in <LOCATION> Ambalanagoda </LOCATION>, 52 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, local police said. In the southern district of <LOCATION> Moneragala </LOCATION>, a police sergeant, an election official and a driver were killed in two separate ambushes on jeeps carrying ballot boxes after polls closed, the military said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abeygoonasekera </PERSON> offered themselves as alternatives to a governing party they said had let the ethnic tensions get out of control. The fighting is no longer a clearly defined conflict between Sinhalese and Tamils. Sinhalese are killing fellow Sinhalese, and rival Tamil factions clash with each other and with Indian troops, who now number about 47,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, who became the world's first female prime minister in 1960, opposed the accord <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed. She served as prime minister from 1960 to 1966 _ when it was the country's most powerful post _ and again from 1970 to 1977 and said she would not return to the stringent economic controls and nationalization policies that led to her downfall. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> also opposed the accord. He also claimed his humble beginnings made him the candidate of the poor and promised to provide about $ 75 a month per family to the nation's most impoverished people. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> was barred by the constitution from seeking a third six-year term. Sunday was marked by at least 22 killings and four kidnappings, and a bomb went off at a <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> polling station and slightly injured a policeman, according to police and military officials. Since the accord aimed at ending the Tamil insurrection was signed, the government says the front has killed more than 650 people. The Tamil insurrection has claimed at least 8,500 lives since 1983.

 Americans' generosity is being tested this holiday season as they respond to both the tragic earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and needs at home that appear greater than ever. By at least one measure _ <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>'s projection for the year of 6 percent to 7 percent growth _ donations nationwide appear to have increased. Charities in many communities say contributions of money, clothing, toys and food are at least keeping pace with last year and should pick up this week before Christmas. But in other cities, contributions have dropped, hampered by cold weather, a shortage of bell ringers, shopping malls that banish fund-raisers from entrances, weak local economies, or even a drain on givers from campaign contributions earlier this year. Efforts to aid the victims of the earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> appear to be having an impact on domestic giving in some cities, but not in others, say spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, Volunteers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>, food banks and other charities. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, with an Armenian population estimated at more than 60,000, most charity officials said it is too early to tell whether that has cut into local giving. But at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the tragedy appears to have prompted an across-the-board increase in giving, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON>, manager of operations, planning and development in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The response has been the greatest I've ever seen in 18 years,'' he said. `` They're giving to both situations _ the homeless here, the hungry in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.'' Among the nation's biggest cities, collections were reported up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but down in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> reported healthy donations, while <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s cities were having a more difficult time. And in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, showed drops, while <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> charities said their contributions were on target. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> reported its drive was ahead of last year's pace, but the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said its cash donations are down, part of the continuing impact of the oil bust. Money is tight in oil-linked <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, too, Maj. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said last week, when collections were running about $ 50,000 below what they were a year ago at the same time. `` I understand from a lot of merchants that people are n't spending as much money,'' he said `` And when they spend money, they give it away. When the merchants have a good year, we have a good year.'' In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, the story is much the same. Giving is down by at least $ 60,000 over last year for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, and officials blame the election year, a fluctuating stock market and a skepticism born of the television evangelist scandals. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloude </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the problem is that many workers are falling further and further behind. `` This year, with the upsurgence of the working poor, those who used to help us now need help themselves,'' she said. The Society of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> dePaul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> -RRB- Council, took in 13,000 pounds of canned food less than last year's total of 187,000 pounds, said executive director <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornbecker </PERSON>. `` I think people have not increased their earning power.'' In <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, contributions to both <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> are flagging. `` Our suspicion is that there's a lot more competition for the charity dollar. A lot of social service programs are going after money because of all the cutbacks for welfare,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of Catholic Charities. A manpower shortage has caused donations to drop in other areas. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s strong job market, with unemployment at 3.5 percent, has cut into volunteers. `` You hate to think that's a bad sign for us in kettle season... We're struggling to find help,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marshalltown </LOCATION>, where only half the usual 15 bell ringers could be mustered In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Volunteers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is pulling in more money from major donors and mail contributors, but its sidewalk <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> campaign is not doing as well as had been expected, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, the group's development director. `` I'm not sure I know why we have a shortage'' of Santas, he said. `` But it is a grueling job. The Santas are usually out on the sidewalk from 8:30 in the morning to 8:30 or 9 o'clock at night, in all kinds of weather.'' The presidential campaign drain has been a problem, said fund-raisers in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> donations for the eight-county region are running 15 percent behind their 1987 rate. `` The fact of the matter is that we usually suffer every four years when there's an election,' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, the army's director of development in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` We got hurt in'84, but we've seen it this year more than ever. They've gotten more sophisticated in their direct mail fund-raising techniques and it's hurt us this year more than ever.

 A teacher who disarmed a student accused of killing one teacher and wounding another said he thought it was a prank when he first saw the teen-ager wielding a semiautomatic handgun. `` I thought it might be one of those Uzi-type water pistols,'' <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchins </PERSON> <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> said. `` Then the glass was shot out and I knew it was a reality.'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, 16, allegedly shot the window out of a locked classroom door at <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to reach a student he wanted to kill. `` My original thought was, ` Oh my God, I'm going to be shot,'' <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> said about the Friday incident. `` Then I remembered I had 38 students in there.'' So <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> stretched his arms in an effort to shield as many students as possible while pleading with the teen-ager not to shoot. `` I cried out to him, ` No, no, do n't do it. This is no way. Please do n't do this,''' <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> said. Police say <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> fired two shots, including one that narrowly missed <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON>, before his Cobray M-11 pistol jammed. <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> tackled <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and held him down while student <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> grabbed the gun, a cheap imitation of a combat assault weapon. `` I've never been in a situation where I had to fight for my life,'' said <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON>, 24. `` I thank God for giving me the presence of mind and the physical ability to get the job done.'' Police say that by the time <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> reached <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON>'s Bible class, he already had killed <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, 40, and wounded <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, 37. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> was in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Sentara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> had gone to Ms. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>'s classrooms in search of a student who had been tormenting him `` I think it's a classic case of the school bully vs. a meek and mild kid and the boy finally got fed up with it and just snapped,'' a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> detective told The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star. The newspaper reported Sunday that authorities were saying privately that racial insults may have ignited the boy's anger. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> is one of four blacks in the student body of 510. Principal <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he was unaware of any racial friction, but he could not rule it out. `` Let's face it, we're dealing with kids and sometimes they go at it,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Police were at a loss to explain why the student shot Ms. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who was alone in her portable classroom. Authorities said that moments after that shooting, the youth went to <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>'s classroom about 50 feet away and showed him the pistol. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> told the boy it was against the rules to bring a gun to school and asked for the weapon before being shot in the shoulder. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> is being held on charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder, malicious assault, use of a firearm in a felony and firing into an occupied building. Relatives and friends have described <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> as a quiet loner with an affinity for guns. He spent most of his time playing with his pet pigeon, watching television and reading gun magazines.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and his Japanese counterpart, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, met today to discuss a thorny border dispute that has disrupted their relations for the past four decades. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said it is prepared to step up economic cooperation with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a Foreign Ministry official said, without elaborating. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also paid a courtesy call on the Imperial Palace, where he signed a register with wishes for the recovery of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, who has been seriously ill for three months. The Soviet foreign minister and <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> spent about 6 -LCB- hours in talks that centered on the disputed Soviet-held <PERSON> Kiril </PERSON> islands, which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> claims. The issue has disrupted relations between the two nations for more than four decades. `` The Soviets have shown no basic change in their position,'' said a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, who requested anonymity. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told his Soviet counterpart that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> saw `` great potential to further economic relations,'' the official said, adding that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> agreed there were possible economic benefits. Observers say that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may be more willing than in the past to negotiate a compromise on the territorial issue because it needs Japanese investment and economic cooperation to help develop the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The official quoted <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as saying one of the obstructions to developing bilateral trade was the Soviet economic system, including the inconvertibility of the Soviet currency and shortage of skilled labor. Bilateral trade totaled $ 4.9 billion in 1987, and is expected to increase slightly this year, to $ 4.98 billion. The two ministers are to meet again on Tuesday to discuss tensions on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and Sino-Soviet relations, well as to continue discussions on the Kiril islands, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The Kirils were occupied by Soviet troops at the end of World War II, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> claims it pioneered settlement of the islands, from which the Soviets ousted 17,000 Japanese residents. In a 1956 Japan-Soviet joint declaration, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> announced its willingness to return two of the islands after a peace treaty is signed. But during his last visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in January 1986, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> refused to discuss the issue. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in July that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s alliance with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was blocking the return of the islands, and said the dispute was delaying Japan-Soviet rapprochement `` Japan-Soviet political dialogue and mutual understanding is generally delayed. ... While there are objective reasons for this, it should be possible to relax or eliminate the reasons for this delay,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> acknowledged after arriving at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Haneda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is to meet Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> Tuesday. Officials said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will renew an invitation for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The two sides plan a joint communique on agreements for cultural exchanges and protection of migratory birds, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The cultural pact includes a program for student exchanges for the first time, they said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Nanuli </PERSON>, who is a journalist, will attend various cultural activities, including a tea ceremony, during her stay. She is to visit a pearl shop, museum and library and meet <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s top fashion designers. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is to leave <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Wednesday for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 The government is looking for a dozen men who would n't mind feasting on a diet of King salmon for 100 days. They'd even get paid a $ 2,300 salary. `` We're talking about salmon with dill weed, broiled salmon, baked salmon _ just like the fine restaurant food,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, project coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the Presidio But there's a catch for those who participate in the study, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> warned. The study also entails confinement, lots of physical tests and no conjugal visits. Participants will sleep, eat and drink at the center's hotellike facility that has a pool table, compact disc player and television. There will be daily walks and some organized activities, but no monkey business allowed. `` We do n't want anyone to sneak a candy bar or a beer,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> originally wanted women for its study, but could n't find any takers. The study, expected to begin in January, is intended to gauge the effect that a steady diet of fish has on keeping arteries free of blood clots.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said today he wants <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> help in getting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to join <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts, but he said Palestinians will not stop their uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. His visit was seen as part of his campaign to drum up international backing for a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, speaking to reporters at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Schwechat </LOCATION> airport, sidestepped a question as to whether the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> would continue armed resistance against Israeli authorities. `` You mean resistance,'' he said several times. `` Our people will definitely continue their intefadeh,'' a reference to the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The Austrian government expressed support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> but did not extend formal recognition to the recently proclaimed Palestinian state. After meetings with Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he had named the head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, as ambassador. But <PERSON> Vrantizky </PERSON> and Mock made clear that <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> would not accredited. They said <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> does not recognize states without territory but pledged political and humanitarian support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In separate letters to <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> and Mock, the Jewish community and two other pro-Israeli organizations expressed displeasure over <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s reception in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. By receiving <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, `` <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> puts itself in the service of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> propaganda,'' said a joint letter from Jewish leaders, the <ORGANIZATION> Austrian-Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and B'nai B'rith. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s comments today came a day after <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, the second-in-command in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, made clear the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does not intend to abandon the use of force. `` -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may stop his government's dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> now if he thinks he will be able to stop our attacks against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military targets,'' <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> said Sunday in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. It was an apparent reaction to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement Friday that any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> terrorist acts would derail U.S.-PLO talks in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> serves as an umbrella organization for eight guerrilla factions which sometimes fight among themselves or launch independent attacks on Israeli targets. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he came to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> `` for more support in the direction of peace ... for the process of peace'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Asked how he wants to bring the Israelis in the process, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, `` through the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and through the support of ... all people who are looking for real just peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He said he had expected <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to reject his offer for direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, made during a speech in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week. `` But sooner or later they will discover that peace is more important for them than anything else,'' he added. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization and government officials have made clear they will not change their stance despite Friday's first direct contacts between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in 13 years. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week reversed its 13-year ban on official contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have indicated that a continuation of the talks will not continue until President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office Jan. 20. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> arrived from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, where he conferred with Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. On Tuesday <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was to visit <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Yugolav </LOCATION> state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. On Sunday, a senior <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> adviser said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a better grasp of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict than any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leader since <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and offers improved hopes for a peace settlement. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, a co-founder of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, said in an interview in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> that he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the designated secretary of state, to make a clear policy statement on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process soon after the inauguration. `` Since <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> there has been no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' he said, describing the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstrations as having had to learn the Palestinian question from scratch. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government needs a lot of work to prove its credibility,'' <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> said. `` I hope <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will do that.''

<HEAD>Northwest Crash Relatives Decorate Disaster Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Relatives of people who died in the August 1987 crash of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 255 decorated the crash site near <LOCATION> Metropolitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with holiday wreaths. About 25 family members brought decorated wreaths Sunday to the site along Interstate 94 where 156 people died when the plane crashed on takeoff. They prayed and joined hands to sing `` Silent Night, Holy Night.'' Some relatives reacted angrily to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal last week that it would accept liability in the crash in cases where plaintiffs declined to seek punitive damages. Families who accept could receive money by early next year for compensatory damages. The plan must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and lawyers for the victims. `` If they tell us to accept now, there's no way,'' said <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Langton </PERSON> of <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, whose daughter <PERSON> Hollins </PERSON>, 26, was killed along with her fiance, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanger </PERSON>, 23. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Polec </PERSON> of <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON>, who organized Sunday's service, agreed. Her daughter and son-in-law, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaft </PERSON>, were killed in the crash. `` It stinks,'' <PERSON> Polec </PERSON> said. `` They do n't want to admit liability and bring out all the things that were really wrong. And that's wrong `` If you do n't institute a lawsuit, you are forgiving them, patting them on the back, when they've completely turned our lives around. I want them punished. No deals for them, absolutely not,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> investigators said pilot error was the chief cause of the crash, which killed all aboard except a young girl. A contributing factor was a failed warning system that should have alerted the pilots that the jet's flaps were not set properly for takeoff.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> today urged the families of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers to stand firm against <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> threats in the fourth bombing of British army homes in the province in a month. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, on a one-day visit to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, spoke out in the <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>'s housing project where more than 100 homes were destroyed or had their windows broken by Sunday's car bombing, police said. A 12-year-old boy and his mother were taken to the hospital and treated for shock, but no other injuries were reported. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> telephoned a warning about a bomb at a housing project in Waterside, but it exploded 15 minutes later, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, on Friday gave wives and children of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers one week to get out of what it called the `` war zone'' and return to the British mainland. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said some army families lived in the <LOCATION> Nelson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> project, but the majority of the residents were civilians with no military connections. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said he opposed withdrawing the families of servicemen, `` great though the difficulties are.'' `` No concessions must be made to terrorism and withdrawal of the families would be that,'' he said. About 10,500 British troops are deployed in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Unofficial estimates say between 1,500 and 2,000 soldiers have their families with them.

 A previously unknown group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping in May of a Belgian physician and accused him of being a spy. The statement by the group, the <ORGANIZATION> Soldiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, was delivered Sunday to two Western news agencies in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Soldiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> announces that it seized <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cools </PERSON>, born 15-7-56 in the Belgian Herk-de-Stad region, on 21-5-88,'' the group said in a typewitten Arabic-language statement. The statement was accompanied by photocopies of Cools' identity card, draft card, driving license and what looked like his passport. Cools, 32, disappeared May 21 after leaving his apartment in the <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camp near the southern port of Tyre. He worked for the Norwegian humanitarian organization Norwac for three months before he vanished. Belgian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Guebert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bioul </PERSON> confirmed that Cools was born on the date listed and at the place cited in the statement. `` I ca n't say whether the photocopied documents with the statement are authentic or not because I have n't seen them. But it's probable that they are,'' he said in an interview He declined further comment. The language of the two-page statement indicated the group was composed of Shiite Moslem militants. Similar pro-Iranian groups hold most of the 14 other foreigners believed held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The statement accused Cools of using his medical activities as a cover for spying on anti-Israeli Shiite guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` After monitoring his suspicious movements and establishing irrefutable evidence about the truth of his actitivities, our mujahedeen -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- arrested him,'' the statement said. `` The board of our organization is examining the charges against Cools to hand down just punishment. The verdict will be issued at a later date,'' the statement concluded. The statement was issued the day after <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, kidnapped a month ago in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was freed in the port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>.

 An Italian technician captured by <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> rebels last June has been released and may fly home today, an Italian Embassy spokesman said. The former hostage, <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Micelli </PERSON>, was turned over to the embassy Sunday and was staying at the residence of the ambassador, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnilli </PERSON>, the spokesman said. `` A special plane has arrived from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to take him there,'' said the spokesman, who refused to be identified by name.

The technician was to have been freed in the first week of December, the source said, but this was delayed for unspecified `` technical reasons.'' The same source also said that rebel conditions for <PERSON> Micelli </PERSON>'s release were `` easily complied with They -LRB- rebels -RRB- only asked that the people in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Tana </LOCATION> -RRB- area benefit more from the irrigation project.'' The statement was taken as indicating the rebel request was relayed to the Ethiopian government.

Fire Chief <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said Sunday's fire was apparently started by a discarded match in a third-floor apartment. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziker </PERSON>, the hotel's owner, identified the dead man as <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 49, a resident whose body was found in a fourth-floor apartment. Police identified the seriously injured man as <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 39. He was being treated for burns at South Bend Memorial Hospital. He had been in critical condition, but doctors upgraded him today to serious. The hospital also admitted a resident for smoke inhalation and another for a broken ankle. Both were in stable condition. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> admitted a woman in serious condition from smoke inhalation. Three residents and two fire fighters were treated for minor injuries and released. Two residents who were unaccounted for Sunday night contacted police early today. They told police they were not at the hotel when the fire broke out. The 105-room, four-story hotel, built in 1924, provided cheap housing for transients and some long-term residents, many of whom depend on Social Security or other limited income, authorities said. Ms. <PERSON> TeleRado </PERSON> said she paid no heed to an alarm that rang for five minutes about 9:40 a.m. Sunday, then went silent, or initially to a maintenance man who pounded on hallway walls and yelled fire. `` Certainly there remains a possibility the information was not passed as quickly as it might have been,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernan </PERSON>. He added that a fire alarm was ringing at midafternoon when he toured the third floor after firefighters controlled the blaze. The blaze spread quickly through the L-shaped brick building, which also housed a music store and karate school. The building was largely gutted and a wall collapsed. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had no estimate of the damages. Once she realized the danger, Ms. <PERSON> TeleRado </PERSON> said, `` I did n't even have time to grab my boots, and my boots were right there by the door.'' Many residents fled shoeless and in nightclothes and lost their few possessions, said the Rev. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, director of a newly opened homeless center who took in 56 Morningside residents. `` They were in the last kind of housing you can get before the streets,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>. `` We're not talking about condominiums being burned out.'' Word of the fire brought an outpouring of food, clothing, gifts and money to the homeless center. Showing a check made out to the center for $ 1,000, center volunteer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said, `` Somebody just walked in off the street with that.''

 The army has taken disciplinary action against officers in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for abuses during basic training such as denying water and medical treatment to recruits, an army spokesman said today. The Hebrew-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said the action followed complaints filed recently by parents of recruits to the prestigious Golani Brigade. Such charges often cause a scandal in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where all men are required to serve three years in the army and all women serve two years. Most men also serve at least 42 days of reserve duty each year until age 55. Maariv detailed five of the complaints in a front-page report. Recruits also were allowed only two or three hours sleep instead of the regulation six hours in at least two instances and were once denied water for an entire day, the newspaper said. The report said some soldiers were also denied visits to the doctor and were left limping from leg injuries. Others have required psychological treatment following the abuses, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said a sergeant and a platoon commander were removed from their posts and a company commander was to be tried by an army tribunal. The paper said unspecified action also was taken against a base commander. The army spokesman would not give details of the actions taken against the four, or of the alleged abuses. As a result of the abuses most recruits dropped out of the unit, where service is mostly on a voluntary basis and only 25 percent complete basic training, <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said. An army spokesman said Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, the head of northern command personally investigated the matter and took disciplinary action against those involved. `` The Northern Command looks very gravely upon such phenomena. Steps have been taken to ensure such phenomena do n't recur,'' the spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> had also appointed a team to further investigate the case.

 A 51-year-old fashion model says she scared away an armed assailant with a rib punch and a kick to the shins because she did n't want to die. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brimer </PERSON> said she left the pistol-packing man stunned Saturday after he assaulted her in a shopping mall parking lot. `` I did n't want to be lying in a ditch, bleeding to death,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brimer </PERSON> said. `` I did n't want to be dead in a gutter.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brimer </PERSON>, 5-foot-5 and 115 pounds, was on her way to her job as a department store model when a man appeared as she was getting her purse from her car. The man jabbed a pistol into her rib cage and told her to get into her car, Mrs. <PERSON> Brimer </PERSON> said. `` I knew if I got in that car, that was it,'' she said. She said she shouted `` No!'' and gave the man the one-two, punch-kick combination. The man looked stunned, then slowly walked away with his head cocked to one side, still looking at her.

 One woman was killed and 31 people were injured when black music fans, angered by lengthy delays at a rock concert, attacked motorists driving on a nearby road, police and witnesses said today. The crowd at the Magalies Resort, about 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, hurled rocks, bricks and other objects at passing cars Sunday afternoon after waiting two hours for the concert to begin, the witnesses said. Twenty-two whites were among those injured as they drove through a 200-yard stretch of road where the mob was attacking vehicles, police and witnesses said. A young black woman was killed when she was hit by a car, police said. One of the performers who arrived late, popular black singer <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaka </PERSON>, narrowly escaped injury when the mob attacked her van which had her name written on the side, witnesses said.

 Service was restored early this morning to a satellite that went on the blink during <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s broadcast of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> game, according to a spokesman for a communications company transmitting signals to the satellite. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> switched to another satellite during the game Sunday, but service on the K2 was not restored until about 12 hours later, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>, director of engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Conus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, one of the companies that sends transmissions to television stations and broadcast networks via the satellite. Viewers of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seahawks-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raiders </ORGANIZATION> contest on Sunday saw their picture turn snowy when the satellite went out about 6:30 p.m. EDT during the game's second half. The K2 satellite, operated by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was restored to service by approximately 6 a.m. EDT, said <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>. `` All our traffic today has gone normally,'' added <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Conus </PERSON> had been successfully transmitting to the GE network in <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where signals are sent to the satellite. The satellite had been spinning and `` mutating from its normal position'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> engineer, who spoke Sunday on condition of anoymity. The exact duration of the outage depended on what part of the country the viewer was in, said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. The network was broadcasting two football games at the time in various parts of the country; the second game, involving the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chargers </ORGANIZATION>, was unaffected, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. After programming on the satellite went out, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> swiftly started moving to an alternate satellite, dubbed K1. Also affected were Independent Network News, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T data and video customers, as well as radio data services, the <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americom </ORGANIZATION> engineer said. Engineers in <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, attempted late Sunday to regain control of the $ 150 million satellite, which is 22,500 miles above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` We knew they were back in touch with the satellite before midnight,'' said <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>, but `` once they regained control of it it took a few hours to get it back in place.'' `` We're not real sure yet as to why this happened,'' said <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Police today arrested a dozen people suspected of belonging to a gang that committed a series of robberies, rapes and murders in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the neighboring <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> countryside. Police involved in the dawn raids resulting in the arrests said the suspected gang members apparently committed violence for thrills or because they were high on drugs. Armed officers from the <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> police and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard joined forces to raid two south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> addresses and arrested one woman and 11 men, police said. Those arrested were taken to <LOCATION> Croydon </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where they were being questioned. Detective Chief Supt. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Surrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said information about the possible identities of the gang members was given by known criminals sickened by the crimes. `` Attacking women and people in their own homes is abhorrent to them and they are willing to give us information, albeit anonymously, but information nevertheless,'' the police chief said. Detectives link the gang with 11 unsolved crimes and believe they may have been responsible for many more. On Dec. 5, three men from the gang raped a young mother in front of her baby son. On Thursday, gang members beat one man to death and a few hours later repeatedly stabbed another. In the latest rampage Thursday night the gang, armed with a gun and machete, hijacked a car and fatally beat its driver, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurburgh </PERSON>, 57. His bound body was left in a field. Early Friday, they broke into the home of retired businessman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> and ransacked the house, slashing and stabbing his son <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>, 41, who was critically ill in a hospital today.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will not play the `` old boy game'' with former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, president-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to head the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, committee chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said today. `` The committee will have a higher set of standards ... for the entire team,'' from Tower down through the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s top set of managers, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., told a group of reporters in a wide-ranging interview Asked whether Tower would receive kid-glove treatment at his confirmation hearing next month before the panel he formerly chaired, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said: `` We are not going to play the old-boy game this go-around.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the panels' ranking Republican, would insist on seeing the full report on Tower by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted an extensive background investigation following allegations of womanizing and drinking, and reports about Tower's coziness with the defense industry Defense analysts and congressional observers have predicted that Tower, chairman of the panel during the first half of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, would receive deferential treatment and breeze to confirmation. But <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he did not want to repeat the mistakes of Tower's early tenure as chairman, when former top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was confirmed <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> now figures prominently in the government's defense procurement fraud case. On other subjects, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said: _ The government should focus its attention on cleaning up nuclear messes at its aging nuclear weapons production facilities around the country and restoring safety to neglected reactors, including those at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not run into a shortage of tritium for use in nuclear weapons for `` a year or two,'' he said, and that prospect poses no immediate threat to national security. `` We've got to find the money to modernize and clean up,'' he said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the facilities, should concentrate on getting one reactor restarted at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, rather than spreading its resources too thinly. _ While the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government has eased restrictions on some well-known anti-apartheid activists like <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, it continues to imprison younger, nonviolent protesters without apparent cause. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> returned Friday from a two-week trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. `` There is not the kind of communication necessary if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s problems are going to be solved peacefully,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to look closely in the coming year at possible new sanctions, including <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> disinvestment. _ It would be `` unrealistic'' to expect a new vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> any time soon on renewal of military aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels. The new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should instead focus its first attention on working with neighboring countries in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to make sure the leftist Sandinista government lives up to promises made to its neighbors in a regional peace plan, he said. _ He will introduce early in the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> legislation that would provide for a broad new program of voluntary national service for young Americans beginning at age 18. The incoming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, `` wants to make that one of the top priorities for the Democratic majority,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, adding he expects substantial Republican support as well. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he hoped the idea, which would include both military and civilian service and encompass expanded VISTA and Peace Corps programs, could be enacted into law within two years.

<HEAD>Kemp Has Worked to Keep Urban Problems, Minorities on GOP Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> football player turned <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman, may bring strong new visibility to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and to the problems plaguing the nation's cities. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> talked about `` progressive conservatism'' and sought to expand his party's appeal among blacks and other minorities as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988. As a congressman, he was an advocate of the supply-side economics and tax cuts that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> embraced. He pushed for tax incentives to promote development in blighted urban neighborhoods, and for a program enabling public housing tenants to buy their homes. His presidential candidacy proved a flop _ he did n't win a primary and never scored better than 13 percent of the vote. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> remained a leading figure among the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s most conservative wing at the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. `` I know we did n't win, but if you look at the Republican platform today ... there's no one who can say we're not winning in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told supporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> during the Republican National Convention. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 53, was named today by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to join his Cabinet as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary. He follows <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a black who survived in the job throughout all eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ and who did so by keeping the lowest of profiles. Even his boss, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, once failed to recognize his own Cabinet member and mistook <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for a mayor. Although <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s strongly conservative ideology is not shared by most of the mayors of the nation's big cities, his appointment immediately met bipartisan support. Urban advocates believe <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s forcefulness and vivid political profile will bring new attention to the miseries of inner cities _ drugs, poverty, violence and despair _ even if he does not become an advocate for the increased federal aid they seek. `` While there's no question a lot of mayors were in the running, we do have an elected official who will bring a visibility to issues that has n't been there before,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s going to be on the front burner again.'' The concern of urban advocates, however, is that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s plans for urban `` enterprise zones,'' based on tax incentives, and for tenant ownership, would supplement and not replace what remains of the federal urban aid programs that were cut or killed in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> dropped out of the presidential race in the aftermath of his final round of poor showings in the big Super Tuesday primaries in mid-March, the last gasp of a candidacy that never met the expectations many Republican leaders had set for it. He has been a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since winning election in 1970 from the upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> district that includes <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, a blue collar-region. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> decided not to seek re-election, though he could have after dropping out of the presidential race. He was born and educated in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, growing up in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and attending nearby <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where he played football and led the nation's small colleges in passing statistics. His father ran a small trucking firm, and his mother was a social worker. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> got his start in pro football with the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in 1957, but he bolted to the new <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chargers </ORGANIZATION>. He was later traded to the Buffalo Bills, where he built a reputation as a perfectionist who did n't mind playing hurt and led the team to two league championships and four division titles. He was the league's most valuable player in 1965, and that same year founded the <ORGANIZATION> AFL </ORGANIZATION> players association. He made his first mark in national politics by helping sell President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on supply-side economics, the belief that cutting taxes would ultimately produce more tax revenues. He had worked with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as a member of the govenor's staff. His call for cutting taxes 10 percent a year for three years was embraced by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and adopted in a modified form by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, it has been credited both with the longstanding economic recovery and the nation's federal deficit that mushroomed in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is the guy who persuaded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that supply-side economics was the way to move, and one can argue these horrendous deficits are a direct result of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s being wrong,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deardourff </PERSON>, a Republican consultant, once said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has always based his political appeal on economic growth, and he was often criticized for a mind-numbing devotion to obscure economists' language and laments for the abandoned gold standard. He once described himself as `` less a candidate than a teacher.'' He frequently surrounded himself at public appearances with black or Hispanic Republicans, some of them former pro football colleagues. While speaking conservative buzz words, he would add his own concerns about inner cities, minorities, and civil rights. `` We've got to have a party that is attractive to minority Americans,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to predict ... that by 1992 one-quarter of our party, if we do our job right, will be black, Hispanic and Asian-American Republicans.''

 Leaders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two main political blocs, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, agreed today to form a coalition government, media reports said. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television both reported that the two parties reached agreement when <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> agreed to demands by the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> be given leadership of the powerful parliament finance committee. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a top aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said agreement had been reached on major issues but that the prime minister was still trying to get smaller religious and nationalist parties to join a broad coalition. `` We can not drink ` L'chaim' yet,'' he said, referring to the traditional Hebrew toast meaning `` to life.'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said the agreement _ seven weeks after parliamentary elections _ was reached in a meeting between negotiators <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of Labor. It said Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> also settled a dispute over how many Jewish settlements would be built in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, agreeing on a figure of five to eight new settlements in the next year. Labor had been trying to hold down settlements because they could be an obstacle to the party's plan to trade land for peace with the Palestinians. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> had promised as many as 40 settlements to a nationalist party it was trying to lure into a coalition. The army radio report said any settlements after the first year would have to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which would be headed by Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, now the foreign minister. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> agreed to the lesser post of finance minister in the new government on the condition his party could also chair the parliament finance committee, giving Labor virtual control over the country's spending. The TV report said that the agreement gave <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> the right to approve which <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> member would head the committee. <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON>, deputy prime minister and an aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said meetings would be held tonight with religious parties. Earlier today, both <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said a new government would be formed by tonight, either with or without Labor. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to form a broad-based coalition with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> to avoid having to make concessions on religious issues to the Orthodox parties. At the same time, it has been negotiating with likely allies in a narrow government with the smaller parties. Within Labor, meanwhile, a group of dovish members called on party leaders not to join a coalition government if that government rules out talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But most of the members of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Peace Forum'' said at a meeting Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would have to prove its verbal renunciation of terror with action before the organization becomes an acceptable partner for peace talks. Israeli law now bans contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which the country views as a terrorist group. Last week the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reversed a ban on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after the organization's chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made statements recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renouncing terrorism. This weekend, a chief <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s renunciation of terror did not include atttacks on Israeli military targets. Coalition negotiations have been under way since Nov. 1 elections gave neither <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> nor Labor a clear mandate. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the 120-member parliament and Labor 39, with the rest split among small parties. The latest impasse arose over <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s reported promise to the nationalistic <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> party to build 40 new settlements in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> during the government's four-year tenure. Labor said it would agreed to build five to seven Jewish settlements, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Labor, which has been pushing for an international conference on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, has resisted building more settlements in occupied land that might be given up in a peace agreement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have called the settlements an obstacle to peace. Negotiators for Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> have reportedly agreed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would lead the proposed government for its full tenure and would not rotate his position with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, as he did in the so-called unity government that both parties have led since 1984. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> would serve as finance minister while <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> would retain the defense ministry. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, a former defense minister, would serve as foreign minister. In the proposed joint government, the two parties would have an equal number of ministers in the decision-making Inner Cabinet.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today named Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, once a combative campaign rival, to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in the new administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hailed <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> for his role in passing the income tax cuts of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and said he was one of the `` premier architects of the opportunity society that we are trying to create.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the appointment, and said he would seek a public-private partnership to `` wage war on poverty.'' He paraphrased the late civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>, saying he has an `` audacious faith'' in the nation's ability to restore hope to `` distressed inner cities and those who live in poverty and despair.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman, known for holding strong views and expressing them freely, pledged to be a `` good team player'' and stick to his own portfolio. `` I'm not going to speak on foreign policy'' during Cabinet meetings, he said. Aside from <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, transition sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mass-transit official <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as transportation secretary and said that appointment may come as soon as Tuesday. The leading candidate for secretary of health and human services remains <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> president who would become <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first black Cabinet appointment. However, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s appointment was the only one announced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a morning appearance before reporters. Remaining at the microphone to field questions on other topics, the president-elect said he would take an intolerant view of any acts of terrorism by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has renounced such acts as the price for diplomatic discussions with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` We would not start off by showing any tolerance of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> terror and I do n't care if it comes from a faction of the left or right or the center or whatever. ... I am concerned about it; I have been and will continue to be concerned about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president-elect seemed at ease as he fielded questions, even as he avoided giving answers to some. When a reporter said he was dancing around the issue of how much to spend for homelessness, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` Yes, I would n't have phrased it that way but that's exactly what I've been doing. He added that he does n't believe commitment to solving a problem is measured solely in terms of federal spending. `` There are other ways to skin a cat,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shed little light on the appointments still to be made, but said he wants an energy secretary knowledgeable about nuclear issues who can help increase the use of nuclear power. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s appointment was the eighth <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made for his Cabinet, with six more to go. The president-elect has said he hopes to complete the task before the Christmas holidays. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was known as one of the most ardent adherents to the supply side theory of economics that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pursued, highlighted by the large income tax cuts of 1981. When the federal deficit ballooned, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> astounded fellow Republicans by declaring the deficit did n't count. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was `` an idea man,'' and said his innovative ideas were needed to solve problems in housing and other areas. In their prepared remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> skipped over their one-time campaign rivalry. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had sought the presidential nomination with an appeal to bedrock conservative issues, and he had said often that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would raise taxes despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign-long pledge not to do so. The president-elect said `` it does n't concern me at all'' that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> might still have national political ambitions of his own. He said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was a man of `` total honor and integrity.'' Asked if he had assurances that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would shed his critic's role, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I hope he has n't shed it ... I want the objectivity of his judgment, and knowing <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> I'll get it.'' When asked about his own future political plans, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said, `` I have n't ruled out seeking office some day, nor have I ruled it in.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said is is `` absolutely necessary, and possible I believe, to gain consensus on a public-private enterprise partnership to wage war on poverty.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has called previously for programs allowing public housing tenants to own their own homes, and has long been a champion of so-called `` urban enterprise zones'' in which government-private programs would be developed to revitalize depressed cities. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 53, a former professional football player, served 18 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, district before seeking the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year. He faltered in the early contests and was gone from the race by spring. But during his brief candidacy, he did what he could to question <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to anti-tax policies. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said frequently that if the voters wanted to raise taxes, they should vote for either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or another rival, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Even so, he hinted broadly in withdrawing from the presidential race last spring that he wanted to be considered for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> passed him by in favor of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> later announced he would take a senior position with the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a private, conservative research organization in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In his 18 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has carved out a reputation not only for his anti-tax, supply-side economic policies, but also for his efforts to appeal to black voters. His decision to quote the late civil rights leader <PERSON> King </PERSON> in his brief remarks was evidence of that.

 About 50,000 refugees from fighting between soldiers and rebels in northern <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> urgently need food, a government newspaper reported Monday. There are 130,000 displaced people in the <LOCATION> Gulu </LOCATION> area about 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Kampala </LOCATION>, and the number is rising because of fighting between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and remnants of the rebel Holy Spirit movement, the New Vision newspaper said. President <PERSON> Yoweri </PERSON> <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON>'s government is receiving food aid from the California-based humanitarian World Vision International and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The government's offensive against the Holy Spirit movement began in September. The movement was founded in 1986 by <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON>, a self-proclaimed warrior priestess. She fled to neighboring <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> in 1987 after the government killed most of her followers, once estimated at 7,000 people. Her poorly equipped followers went to battle believing the oil she smeared on their chests would ward off bullets and the stones she gave them would explode like grenades.

 Friendly acquisitions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies by foreign investors are on the rise, but hostile takeovers by foreigners are still rare, a congressional report says. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative and auditing agency of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said foreign acquisitions as a share of all takeovers has increased from 6 percent in 1984 to 9 percent last year to 13 percent in the first half of this year. However, of the 1,281 foreign takeovers during the 4 -LCB- - year period, only 17 were hostile, or resisted by the target company's board of directors, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> D-N.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, a member of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who has proposed tax measures designed to curb hostile takeovers, said in an interview Monday that he is concerned by both the increase in hostile mergers generally and by increasing foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> The steady rise until last year of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit has put more dollars in the hands of foreigners, who have in turn spent them on investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Much of the foreign investment has been in real estate and government securities, but <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s figures indicate that foreigners also are buying up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations. `` I think that raises some general policy questions that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has to address. ... If you have broad foreign ownership of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assets, the question is, Who are Americans working for? Where is the income stream from those assets directed?'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said. Other economic observers, among them <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, say foreign investment can be seen as a vote of confidence in the strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. They point out that foreign investment in American firms creates jobs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Between 1984 and mid-1988, there were 25 attempted hostile takeovers by foreigners, and 17 of them were successful. That compares with a total of 77 hostile takeovers out of 191 attempts. <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said the relative success rates _ 68 percent for foreign hostile bids versus 40 percent for contested bids generally _ indicate that foreign tax laws or some difference in regulation may give foreign bidders an advantage over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bidders. British firms accounted for eight of the 17 foreign unfriendly mergers. Three were by Canadian companies, two by French firms and one each by Dutch, Japanese, Swedish and Swiss investors.

 White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> today denied reports that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed the possibility of an administration job with TV evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> during a 1985 meeting. `` He met with him, I was there, great meeting, just like hundreds of other meetings he had with people who he was seeking their support,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> who will serve <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the White House spokesman capacity that he now holds under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> initially told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` was seeking his support for the campaign, absolutely ... You have hundreds of meetings like that when you're running for president.'' But the spokesman subsequently said he had misspoken and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not solicit campaign support from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at the briefing: `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> thought. There was no talk of jobs or payoffs or anything else. It was a simple meeting as the vice president had with hundreds of other people and individuals asking their support ... Asking his support for various policies and so forth. `` They talked about their Christian beliefs. They talked about the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign. It was just a friendly discussion.'' At the time that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> in November 1985, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential press secretary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was gearing up for his presidential run, as was TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ultimately defeated resoundingly in the Republican primaries. In March 1987, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stepped down from his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, admitting he had had a sexual involvement with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ties to the fallen broadcast preacher through the 1985 meeting and through three close <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> associates who also were hired by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> as consultants were the subject of a story in Sunday's opinion section of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> characterized as mostly accurate the story, which detailed the <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> employment of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former press secretary <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign religious liaison <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wead </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he had no quarrel with the story, `` except the innuendo there was something wrong with it,'' He said however there was no talk of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> taking an administration job, as was alleged by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former personal bodyguard <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardister </PERSON>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that after leaving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff, he had worked for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> as a marketing consultant beginning in 1985, but that he had not set up the Bush-Bakker meeting. `` I have a very hard set rule: I do n't lobby <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' because of their longtime personal relationship, <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. His work for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> never had anything to do with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, whose association with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> ended with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s troubles last year. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> also was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign press secretary for a time. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he knew nothing about allegations that political pressure caused the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 to drop a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> Commission-inspired probe into <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fund-raising practices.

 A man pleaded guilty today to the sexual torture and murder of five men and was sentenced to life in prison. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, already sentenced to life plus seven years for sexually torturing, beating and injecting a man in a separate case, described the killings during a 90-minute court hearing. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, 39, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the death of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Arleta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, testifying that he put a plastic trash bag over his head and tied it with a rope until <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> suffocated. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoops </PERSON>, then 24, died of a loss of blood. He said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> died because they could not breathe after he injected them with drugs and gagged them while they were tied to a bed in his midtown <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole on the first charge and life in prison for the other four counts of second-degree murder. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, an art collector and operator of a shop that sold art objects and antiques, became a household name in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after his arrest in April after a man wearing only a dog collar ran screaming from his midtown house. The man told authorities he had been sexually tortured, beaten and injected with drugs by <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>. `` I kept him bound to a bed with ropes tying his hands and feet,'' <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> said when he pleaded guilty. The arrest, followed by days of digging in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s yard and searching his rambling house, resulted in the discovery of two skulls on <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s property and hundreds of photographs depicting nude and sometimes unconscious men. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>'s skull was found buried on <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s property. No mention was made of where the rest of his remains or the bodies of the others were. `` I tied his hands and feet on the bed,'' <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> testified about the death of <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, who was 19 when he disappeared in 1984. `` I injected drugs into his body and gagged him. Apparently the combination of drugs and the gag made it impossible for him to breathe.'' <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> was 25 when he was last seen in 1985. Relatives of some victims attended the hearing after private meetings with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> County Prosecutor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON>.

 A lawyer warned today that upholding <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s suspension of two former student editors of a conservative newspaper would stifle freedom of expression on campuses nationwide. But a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> college said the suspensions of the two white students for harassing a black professor `` is a simple case of student misconduct. ... This is not a case which involves their right to publish.'' The claims came in opening arguments on a bid by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, 21, for a court order reinstating the two. <ORGANIZATION> Grafton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> will decide whether they should be allowed to return to classes next month rather than in September, when their 18-month suspensions expire. The hearing also will give a first reading of how the court will treat a lawsuit filed by the two and another <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> staffer claiming the college discriminates against conservatives. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer, argued that `` freedom of expression exists on the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> campus for all members of the community, not just the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>,'' a student-run, off-campus weekly. But <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, lawyer for the ousted students, called the case `` a signal unmistakable to the student body and those connected with it and the student bodies across the country that ` you will do as we wish or you will not do it at all.''' <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, were suspended in March by a campuswide disciplinary panel for harassing <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. A third student got a shorter suspension and fourth probation for a classroom clash in February with <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, one of whose music courses was panned by the Review as `` one of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s most academically deficient.''

<HEAD>Report Says Federal AIDS Awareness Program Got Off to Slow Start</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The AIDS education program conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> has been marred by delays in mass mailings and by limited broadcasts of public service ads, a congressional report said Monday. The report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also said callers may find it difficult to get through to an AIDS telephone hotline. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that even though the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS education budget increased from about $ 17 million in fiscal 1985 to nearly $ 210 million in 1988, `` its efforts to focus national attention on AIDS prevention were impaired by the slow implementation of key activities aimed at the general public.'' Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., who requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation, said she would forward a copy of the report to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for use as `` a guide on how not to implement health education programs. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found several problems associated with `` AIDS Awareness and Prevention Month'' in October 1987. The center in May 1987 chose that month for its big push but was unable to get clearance from the White House Domestic Policy Council for the centerpiece of the campaign _ a national AIDS information mailing to all households. Plans for the mailing, which had been explicitly sought but not required by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, were dropped in July 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said. The following year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made the mailing mandatory, and the pamphlet `` Understanding AIDS'' was mailed last June. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> produced 38 public service announcements on AIDS and distributed them to the major television networks on Sept. 30, 1987, the report said, but there was only one airing by a network during the following `` AIDS Awareness' month. The three networks did air <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> public service announcements six times in November 1987. When ads did air, they were not likely to be seen by many people. Between December 1987 and February 1988, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reported, nearly 90 percent of all network-aired AIDS public service announcements were shown during non-primetime viewing hours. Nearly 60 percent were shown between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The report also cited problems, largely corrected by last summer, of getting through to an AIDS hotline. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> expanded the hotline from 17 lines to 68 lines in October 1987 as part of its `` awareness month'' activities, but the monthly busy signal percentage was far higher than the 3 percent maximum specified in its contract. Between October and December 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, the average busy signal rates on operator-assisted lines ranged from 38 percent to 65 percent. By last summer, however, the rate was down to 7 percent. Busy signals are still a problem immediately after public service announcements are aired and <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> is working to correct the situation, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The watchdog agency said it also found that the AIDS Information Clearinghouse, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> contractor, was taking twice as long as it should have to send out copies of a pamphlet called `` What You Should Know About AIDS'' when investigators sought them last January and Feburary. But another order in March arrived within the six-day period required by contract. <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for failing to provide leadership in the AIDS crisis, particularly in educating Americans, and also said she was disturbed by `` this poor response by the media to provide frequent AIDS education messages.'' <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> chairs the AIDS Task Force of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Last year she urged the TV networks to reconsider their refusal to air the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s education messages, which discussed condoms as a means of preventing the spread of AIDS.

 A gas cylinder exploded on a passenger train and started a fire Monday, killing eight people and injuring 28, police said. The blast occurred on the express train from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, according to police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The train was near the village of <LOCATION> Etay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Baroud </LOCATION>, about 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> when the explosion occurred in the cafeteria section of the train's third-class compartments, the sources said. Three cars were burned. A preliminary investigation found that boiling water overflowed, extinguishing the flame on a stove. When a cafeteria attendant tried to relight it, the gas cylinder exploded. The attendant was arrested, the police said.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> and brother <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, voted today to formally elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> President, fulfilling an antiquated but surviving constitutional ritual. `` It was a nice honor, to get to cast a vote for my dad,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> oilman, said before performing his duty in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> as one of the nation's 538 electors. `` It'll be nice to be a small footnote in history.'' <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and seven other electors voted for the Republican ticket in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. In state capitals across the nation, designated electors were meeting to carry out their constitutional obligation and cast their electoral ballots. Some states had brief ceremonies steeped in history, while others made a party of the event. There were no surprises among electors in the first group of states to conduct the balloting. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, electors went to a long brunch before casting their ballots. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the 24 electors cast their votes for the Republicans, as expected, and placed their ballots in a wooden ballot box used by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> when he voted in the election of 1860. `` Without doubt it's one of the most misunderstood things in all of government and politics,'' said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> elector <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> LaHood </PERSON>. Electors cast separate votes for president and vice president. Among the first to vote was <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where all 12 electors cast their votes for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and for native son <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as vice president. `` It's certainly appropriate,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, the elector from the same <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is from. `` I've known him for about 20 years.'' The voting today sets the stage for the final ceremony in a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 4, when Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, will open the ballots and announce the results _ and formally declare himself the president-elect. Supervising the state electoral voting are officials at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Although officials do not monitor the outcome of the voting, attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said his office had received phone calls from secretaries of state in two states asking about procedures to name substitute electors. `` We probably will only have a few states having problems,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The ritual is something of an anticlimax to the long presidential year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defeated Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the general election with 53 percent of the more than 91 million votes cast and carrying enough states to win 426 electoral votes to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 112. That should be the vote after today's meetings, give or take a `` faithless elector'' or two, should there be any. The electors were selected by the parties in each state _ one for each congressman and senator the state has. Votes cast for president in each state in fact were votes for the Republican or Democratic slate of electors. By law the states must hold their electoral meetings today, though the time and setting is up to each state. Many hold it in state Capitol buildings. Among others with the duty were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s designated White House chief of staff, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> football coach <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON>, who seconded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination at the Republican National Convention, was a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> elector. But most were state party workers or insiders rewarded for their labors, and state officeholders, such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. Guy Hunt. Electors are expected to vote for their party's presidential nominee, and vice presidential nominee. But in this unique American system, the Constitution does n't require it. About half the states have laws that require electors to vote as pledged, but constitutional experts question whether those laws could be enforced. Before today, eight electors over the years have broken their pledges and voted for someone else. A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> elector, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, treasurer of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic-Farm-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, had said he might cast a symbolic vote this year for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for vice president instead of Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the party's nominee. With the furor over <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican vice presidential running mate still fresh in memory, some electors have been getting letters urging them to `` Dump Quayle'' and cast vice presidential ballots for someone else. But Republicans said they were n't worried. `` They're going to do their duty, as the people instructed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> press </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruggi </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is about to launch a new research effort to improve the `` definition'' or clarity of television screen pictures and in the process, hopefully bolster the American TV manufacturing industry. The department, in a brief statement, said its <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> hoped in the next two to three weeks to solicit contract proposals `` in the areas of high-definition, low-cost display technology ...'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s primary goal is the development of an advanced, but small, TV-type screen or monitor that can display text, characters or video signals with great clarity, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodanyi </PERSON>. The monitors would be used inside new helicopters and airplanes, training simulators and other types of vehicles and command centers. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also hopes, however, that by providing seed money for new research, it can enlist electronic and semiconductor companies to fight <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the lead in developing the next generation of TV sets for commercial use. High-definition television, or HDTV, offers the promise of sharper, brighter and wider pictures that could match the quality of motion picture films. Japanese industry has developed an HDTV system and plans to begin marketing it in 1990. A consortium of European firms also is thought to be ahead of American industry in exploring the new technology. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say they hope that by prodding research in the field of high-definition monitors, the government also can ultimately spur domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, the electronic chips at the heart of computers. The HDTV technology will require extensive use of semiconductors and that could provide the incentive needed by domestic companies to re-enter the semiconductor market, said one official, who asked not to be identified. The source added the <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which remains U.S.-owned, is almost sure to be included in the DARPA effort. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> already has asked for a $ 15 million contract to develop what it calls flat tension mask technology. The flat tension mask resembles a conventional TV picture tube but has a flat face that is sharper and much more rugged, which would make it attractive for battlefield use. `` But this wo n't be a one-company effort,'' added the source. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in its statement, said <ORGANIZATION> DARPA </ORGANIZATION> had been working in the arena of high-definition monitors for years `` and where practical, will conform to evolving commercial HDTV standards.'' `` A technology base common to defense and commercial needs benefits <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> as lower unit prices result from large-scale production,'' the statement added. `` HDTV and computers share ... a common dependence on semiconductors. DOD has an interest in maintaining a robust <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor industry so as to assure a domestic source of the most advanced microelectronic products.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> first reported on the TV research project in Monday editions.

 Authorities have issued arrest warrants for two police officers supected of involvement in a prostitution ring that sold <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> women to Japanese employers, police said Monday. More than 10 other Bangkok-based groups, including airlines officials and businessmen, were involved in the ring linked to organized crime in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, said a senior police official. Police issued warrants last month for Capt. <PERSON> Suplin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukkasee </PERSON> and Lt. <PERSON> Chamras </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamma </PERSON>, who have agreed to report to authorities for questioning by Tuesday, said the police official, who requested anonymity. He said the officers were suspected of luring two women to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with the promise of well-paid jobs. The two, who were forced to work as prostitutes, sought refuge in the Thai Embassy in October, the official said. <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> women aged 20 to 25 were sold to Japanese employers for at least $ 16,000 and were expected to earn twice that amount, the official said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is preparing to leave office taking credit for progress in areas ranging from nuclear arms reduction to deregulation of business. As for things that went wrong, well, they were somebody else's fault. After eight years as governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and eight as president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speeches still ring with attacks on governmental meddling and warnings of the dangers of communist aggression, just as they did when he was a speaker on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before he entered politics. In a speech summing up his administration's record on domestic policy last week, he denounced the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration for saying, as he phrased it, that `` the nation's problems were too complicated to manage.'' `` Well, we said, of course they are _ so government should stop trying to manage them; stop putting its faith in the false god of bureaucracy and trust the genius of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people instead,'' he told an audience of political appointees. Two days later, in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, he blamed the `` on-again, off-again'' record of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the failure of his policy of supporting anti-communist rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. And on Saturday, he told listeners to his weekly radio address, `` Since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> changed the budget law -LRB- in 1974 -RRB-, federal spending has in fact quadrupled, and it has come right out of your pocket.'' In his domestic policy speech on Wednesday, the president said a `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> colony,'' operating through an `` iron triangle'' of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the news media and special interest groups, was stifling efforts to wipe out the budget deficit. To some, the `` iron triangle'' phrase was reminiscent of the speech in 1961 in which <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, the last president before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to complete eight years in office, inveighed against the power of the `` military-industrial complex.'' `` He is raising a flag to a system that we are a part of and that we participate in because that's the way business is done these days,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, adding that the president was sharing `` some of the lessons he's learned from his eight years.'' The president acknowledged that he was borrowing the iron triangle phrase from others who had used it before him. What he did n't acknowledge was that they used it differently. In the original version, it described the relationship between congressional committees, the bureaucracy and interest groups. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> skipped the part that suggested agencies that were part of his administration might have helped fuel the deficit. He also did not say what he meant by a special interest group, although it's a term he often uses to describe people who are for things he's against. The next event on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule after his `` iron triangle'' speech was a friendly get-together with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group of corporate lobbyists. Or, some might say, a special interest group. In <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, the president attacked `` the notion that judgeships should be used to further privately held beliefs not yet approved by the people.'' The remark was a new twist. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ran for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and 1984 on platforms calling for the appointment of judges who would overturn the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling that legalized abortion. Polls repeatedly have shown that most Americans support that decision. In 1986, the president crisscrossed the country arguing for the election of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that he said would, among other things, confirm the kind of federal judges he favors. But when his nomination of conservative jurist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ran into a buzz-saw of opposition, he charged that his opponents were politicizing the judicial selection process. As for foreign policy, the president told the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> students, `` It's precisely where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president have worked together, as in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, or resolved differences, as in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and many aspects of U.S.-Soviet relations, precisely there, our policies have succeeded, and we see progress. `` But where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president have engaged each other as adversaries, as over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies have faltered, and our common purposes have not been achieved,'' he said. The president did not mention <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where in 1982 the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> joined in placing limits on the president's policy of using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines to oversee the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas and invading Israeli troops from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The Marines were withdrawn after a suicide car bomber killed 241 of them in 1983. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about the bombing at his daily news briefing Monday, said, `` The president has publicly talked about the bombing as one of his most discouraging and sad moments in office as president, but I do n't believe there is any new information on the perpetrators.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> prison officials today halted plans to execute an inmate Tuesday in anticipation that a federal court would block the execution now that he has ordered his appeals continued. An attorney also filed new legal motions with the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> seeking to block the execution, which would have been <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s first since 1965. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleban </PERSON> requested a stay of execution for <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who previously had abandoned his appeals, wants to continue his legal challenges. Included with the request for a stay was a letter <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> wrote to the federal appeals court. `` I had decided to forego any further review of my cases because I had lost faith in a judicial system that had failed me for eight years,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> wrote. `` However, due to recent developments on my case, this travesty can no longer be ignored. And thus it would be an act of suicide for me to follow through with my execution without having these matters reviewed,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> wrote. The recent developments were apparently a reference to a recent newspaper article that raised doubts about <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s guilt. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> faces two separate death warrants _ one for the 1980 bludgeoning death of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and another for the 1985 murder of fellow inmate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Judge: Amish Must Display Slow-Moving Signs on Horse-Drawn Buggies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRESTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge ruled Monday that Amish people must display slow-moving vehicle signs on their horse-drawn buggies, but lawyers said the religious-freedom issue could go all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. State law requiring the signs does not violate the Amish's First Amendment right to freedom of religion, <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> said in his ruling. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Villaume </PERSON>, an attorney representing the Amish, said the case will be appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Villaume </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Attorney <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Opat </PERSON> said the case likely will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and may end up in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Fifteen Amish people appeared before <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> in October after they had been ticketed for violating the state regulations. They were cited for failing to obey a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law requiring them to display triangular slow-moving vehicle signs on the rear of their buggies. During the day, the signs can be black with white reflective tape. When it is dark or foggy, the signs must be orange. <PERSON> Opat </PERSON> argued that prosecuting the Amish for not complying with the state law was a case of public safety, not religious prosecution. He said public safety issues significantly outweigh any infringement the law may have on the Amish's constitutional right of religious freedom. <PERSON> Villaume </PERSON>, of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, said it was ironic that the Amish, who settled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1700s to avoid religious persecution, were still fighting battles to protect their religion. A witness for the Amish said they oppose displaying the signs because they feel the signs are `` worldly'' representations of man, not God, and they hope to keep their religious practices separate from the modern world. But <PERSON> Opat </PERSON> said the Amish willingly displayed the signs for years, but then quit displaying them within the past year or two. There also has been no uniformity among the Amish in <LOCATION> Fillmore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, he said, noting that some display the orange signs, some the black and white signs and others no signs at all. The Amish have regularly used the color red on their barns, leading the prosecutor to question whether the dispute was really over religious beliefs. As a result, he said in October, the Amish have a `` pick-and-choose society.''

<HEAD>For Escaped East German Border Guard, No Going Home For Christmas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As Christmas approaches, <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> starts thinking of home on the other side of the dangerous Berlin Wall. But the former East German border guard knows there's no going back after his dramatic July 1987 escape to the West. `` Everything, everyone in my family is back there. It was tough last Christmas. This year it's also going to be hard _ really hard,'' <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> says. While hundreds of East Germans flee to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> over border barriers each year, only a small number return to their communist homeland, West German officials say. For those fearing possible punishment if they return, there are often pangs of homesickness, especially during the Christmas season. <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON>, who says he would be prosecuted as a deserter if he dared to return home, described what it's like to be an East German escapee unable to be with his family for Christmas. `` Last year I decided to do volunteer work during Christmas at Checkpoint Charlie'' to keep occupied, <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Just sitting around alone _ `` he said, shaking his head without finishing the sentence as he reflected on another Christmas away from home. Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, a crossing between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, is tightly controlled by communist troops. <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> works full-time on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> side of the checkpoint, giving guided tours at a museum devoted to escapees from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and lecturing student groups on conditions in his homeland. While <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> admits it is hard making contacts in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as an outsider, he says he's happy he took the chance. `` Even now after more than a year I wake up some mornings and break out laughing just at the thought of being here,'' <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> was a 19-year-old East German border guard when he climbed down from a guard tower and scrambled over a steel-mesh fence separating <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Spandau </LOCATION> district from East German territory near <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> said he decided to flee after he was assigned duty as a border guard and he was faced with shoot-to-kill orders along the East German-constructed barriers. `` There are so many who try to flee, and every DDR -LRB- <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -RRB- soldier is afraid they may someday have to shoot someone escaping. I could n't come to terms with that,'' <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> said. At least 77 people have been killed trying to escape over communist-built barriers blocking off <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, according to the Working Group August 13. The human rights organization took its name from the day <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> began building the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> on Aug. 13, 1961. <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> gave a gripping account of his escape to the West. `` There were always two guards, but your partner and guard tower were changed regularly so you did n't get to know each other well enough to build up trust,'' <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> recalled. `` So after planning for two weeks _ I knew I had to do it _ I waited until my partner fell asleep at 3 a.m.,'' he said. After hiding his colleague's ammunition, <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> said he climbed down from the tower. His knees weak with fright, <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> crossed the strip of land separating the tower from the 10 foot-high steel-mesh fence blocking his way to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` I was so afraid I would be spotted and shot at from another tower. My knees were like rubber and I could n't run. I staggered like a drunk to that fence and pulled myself over it with metal hooks I stuck in the holes of the panels,'' <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> said. Now, 17 months after his escape, <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> says he's sorry he worried his parents by fleeing. `` I know I caused them anguish, but now they know I'm safe and I'm sure they're happy for me,'' he said, asking that the names of his parents and two younger brothers not be used. He said his home was in the <LOCATION> Karl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marx-Stadt </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of the Czechoslovak border. Asked what he would like most for Christmas if he had a choice, <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> said: `` That no DDR soldier ever again has to shoot someone going over the border. That the day comes when we can pass freely through that Wall.''

<TEXT>
 Infantry, armor and artillery units returned home Monday in a partial Vietnamese withdrawal from occupied <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where insurgents are fighting a jungle war against the Hanoi-supported government. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said the soldiers were leaving western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on four land routes and by boat down the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and claimed only 50,000 troops would remain to support the client government established after its December 1978 invasion. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rulers whose murderous regime <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> overthrew a decade ago have the strongest force in the three-party guerrilla coalition fighting the occupation army. Villagers and children waving Vietnamese and <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> flags lined the red dirt road on which soldiers of the 5th and 309th Divisions approached and crossed the frontier Monday at Sa Mat. Included in columns were Soviet-made trucks towing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> howitzers, and armored personnel carriers captured at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. At least one vehicle still carried the horse emblem of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 11th armored cavalry. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the client government it supports in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> say 18,000 soldiers will have left <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in a week-long withdrawal scheduled to end Wednesday. Western analysts sometimes said earlier partial withdrawals, which began in 1982, were only `` troop rotations.'' Americans and others acknowledge, however, that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has reduced its strength in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> substantially from a high of 200,000 soldiers. While vehicles moved along the dusty roads, the official Cambodian news agency <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> said a fleet of nearly 200 vessels carrying Vietnamese soldiers sailed past <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> on their way home. It said about 10,000 people, including <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and military officers, lined the banks in the early morning to bid farewell to the soldiers. Division commander Col. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chau </PERSON> came ashore to shake hands and the fleet then sailed southward on the 70-mile journey to the border, the agency said. At Sa Mat, an officer commanding three vehicles, told reporters his unit had seen little action in two years against <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. `` They may attack some of our small units but when they hear armor coming they disappear,'' <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> said. Other soldiers also said they had met few guerrillas during a prolonged lull, which has been confirmed by Western analysts and interpreted either as the end of the guerrillas or a `` calm before the storm.'' Some say the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, whose strength usually is given as 30,000-40 ,000, are concentrating on organization, propaganda and stockpiling weapons as the Vietnamese proceed with a promised pullout of all forces by 1990 Earlier Monday, elements of the two divisions joined in a farewell ceremony at <LOCATION> Kompong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cham </LOCATION>, a provincial capital on the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> about 45 miles from the border. A rock band played, thousands of children lined the roads and commanders laid wreaths at a monument to the hundreds of thousands of people killed during the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s reign of terror in 1975-79. Children held up placards reading `` We will think of you always'' as the Vietnamese column rolled through the war-scarred town toward steel ferries that took them across the river. <LOCATION> Kompong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cham </LOCATION>, once a thriving resort and center of the rubber trade, was largely destroyed in 1973 when the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> nearly seized it from the U.S.-backed government of President Lon Nol. It became a ghost town during <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule. At this border post, the Vietnamese soldiers completed a five-day trek across <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from bases in <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, a province on the Cambodian border with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Thai </PERSON>, a Vietnamese army spokesman, said about 6,000 soldiers and 300 vehicles were involved. About 150 foreign journalists were in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for the withdrawal.

 Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, named to head <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, will now have a forum to keep his own political profile in the public eye <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who fought unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, said after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> introduced him as the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> choice Monday, `` I have n't ruled out seeking office some day, nor have I ruled it in.'' For now, though, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> will have a chance to test some long-held theories for reviving inner cities and will also bring new visibility to the problems of housing and poverty that plague the nation's cities. A nine-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from a district that includes part of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is still just 53, and the former pro football quarterback presents a youthful, energetic appearance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had extracted no promises that his former rival would not pursue his own political agenda, but `` it does n't concern me at all.'' `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> has shifted gears here to be part of our team,'' the president-elect said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> himself said he would keep silent on issues outside his new assignment. `` I'm not going to speak on foreign policy. ... I'm going to be a good team player,'' he said As <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> will succeed <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who survived all eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration while keeping the lowest of profiles. Even President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once mistook <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for a mayor, a mistake <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't make about a widely known politician who is especially popular among conservatives. He is best known for his advocacy of `` supply-side econonics,'' including the tax-cutting bill bearing his name that was the heart of Reaganomics. But his legislative interests were broad. He and liberal <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> formed an unlikely alliance to push for urban `` enterprise zones,'' a program of tax breaks to promote development of blighted urban areas. As a congressman, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> could n't get the bill passed but could try again in his new position. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also introduced legislation to enable residents of federal low-income housing to buy their homes at below-market prices. Although his strongly conservative ideology is not shared by most of the mayors of the nation's big cities, his appointment was generally praised. `` While there's no question a lot of mayors were in the running, we do have an elected official who will bring a visibility to issues that has n't been there before,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s going to be on the front burner again.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, grew up in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and attended nearby <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where he played football and led the nation's small colleges in passing. His father ran a small trucking firm, and his mother was a social worker. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> got his start in pro football with the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in 1957, but he bolted to the new <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chargers </ORGANIZATION>. He was later traded to the Buffalo Bills for $ 100, where he built a reputation as a perfectionist who would play hurt. He led the team to two league championships and four division titles. He was the league's most valuable player in 1965, and that same year founded the <ORGANIZATION> AFL </ORGANIZATION> players association. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> made his first mark in national politics by helping sell <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on supply-side economics, the belief that cutting taxes would ultimately produce more tax revenues. He had worked with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as a member of the govenor's staff. His call for cutting taxes 10 percent a year for three years was embraced by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and adopted in a modified form by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It has been credited with bringing about economic recovery but also has been blamed for pushing the federal budget deficit to record levels in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> dropped out of the presidential race in mid-March, after poor showings in the big Super Tuesday primaries. He had decided earlier not to seek re-election to his congressional seat in order to pursue the presidency. In recent months, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> appeared to be angling for an administration job that would keep him in the political arena and public eye. At the Republican Convention in August, he let it be known he would like to be selected as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential nominee. He was n't. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also suggested back then that he'd like to be secretary of state, or defense, or treasury, but said he did n't think he'd be offered any of those jobs. He was right. In September, the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research organization, announced <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would become one of its fellows, lecturing and writing about economics and foreign policy. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> appararently was not content with the prospect of an ivory-tower future. He said Monday, `` This is far more attractive, with all due respect.''

<HEAD>Judge Changes Mind, Will Allow AIDS Defendants In Court</HEAD>

 One of three judges who said they would bar AIDS-infected defendants from their courtroom has changed his mind, saying he is putting his professional concerns ahead of his personal beliefs. `` If they just want to be there for a fair trial, they got it,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district judge, said of defendants who test positive for the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and two other <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district judges, O.L. `` Pete'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, announced last week that they had barred AIDS-infected defendants from their courtrooms to enter pleas or to be sentenced. Instead, the judges said they would conduct the procedures by telephone _ a practice each judge carried out once. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said he did not want himself or the people in his courtroom exposed to defendants harboring the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said their bailiffs did not want to handle AIDS-infected defendants. The judges' policy sparked complaints from lawyers and civil libertarians that the defendants' constitutional rights were being violated. Others were concerned about the image the judges' action gave <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. `` We've been fighting that -LRB- bigoted -RRB- image for a long time _ we do n't need to fight it again with our judges,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a board member of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> AIDS Outreach. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said he changed his mind after talking with several people, including his wife. `` My wife called me a big, stupid jerk,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Herald </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Monday. `` I'm putting my professional thoughts above my personal thoughts'' by allowing AIDS-positive defendants into the courtroom, he said. But <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said that under certain circumstances, such as if an AIDS-infected defendant is known to be violent, he may hold a hearing at the jail intead of in court. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> also altered their views somewhat, saying they will look at each case individually. `` If there's evidence that the defendant has a history of violence, they'll be treated differently than one who does n't,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` But someone wo n't be necessarily banned from the courtroom just because he has AIDS.'' The judges had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for guidelines for dealing with AIDS-infected defendants. Neither organization had any available.

<HEAD>Cash Heart Surgery Goes Well, Doctor Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Country music star <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> underwent successful coronary bypass surgery Monday in the same hospital where his friend, <PERSON> Waylon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, was hospitalized for a similar problem, doctors said. `` His surgery went fine,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, who performed the operation on Cash with Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laws </PERSON>. `` There was no evidence of any damage to his heart.'' <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said that there was 90 percent blockage to the main coronary artery _ `` a potentially very lethal sort of block.'' There was also blockage in another artery. Alternative blood vessels were used to bypass the blocked arteries and restore normal blood flow to Cash's heart during the 2 -LCB- - hour surgery The procedure was `` pretty straightforward coronary artery bypass surgery'' to prevent the 56-year-old singer from having a heart attack, <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. After the surgery, Cash was in critical but stable condition in the coronary intensive care unit, a situation that is `` absolutely standard'' in such cases, said <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said doctors have not said when Cash may be moved into a private room or when he may be released. No discharge date has been set for Jennings either. He has sung with Cash on numerous occasions, and was also in <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Monday after undergoing triple bypass surgery Dec. 12. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was moved from intensive care to a private room during the weekend, and doctors hope he will be home for Christmas, although Ms. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said that is not definite. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, 51, had been hospitalized for chest pains after a performance near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in October.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and his crew spent four days renovating a housing project apartment only to have each day's work undone by thieves who took everything from wiring to the toilet. Then the maintenance crew gave up. The apartment is one of more than 1,100 vacant apartments in the city's 10 public housing projects. More than 600 people remain on a waiting list for subsidized housing as <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> officials battle what they say is a wave of drug-related thefts. The problem erupted early this year when cocaine began to flourish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> at the same time the price of aluminum began to rise at recycling centers, according to housing authority officials. Aluminum has become a major source of income for drug users, according to <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a maintenance supervisor for the St. Thomas project. Window sashes, mail boxes, mail slots, faucet handles _ anything made of aluminum _ brings between 40 cents and 80 cents a pound. Housing authority workers say apathetic tenants and unresponsive police share part of the blame for the ransacking of vacant units. `` There's no involvement by our residents here,'' said <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, manager of the St. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> housing project. `` For somebody to go on a second floor and tote a refrigerator out and put it on a truck, someone should become somewhat suspicious. But apparently they do n't.'' When the thefts are reported to police, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, `` All we get is an item number and ` Good luck getting your item back.''' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechet </PERSON> said there is a three-man unit assigned to the housing authority, and police respond whenever they are called. But she said calls to police from the authority are infrequent. She also said residents may be afraid to call police because they fear retaliation. `` They live in a very dense area, very close to those parties that are committing those acts,'' she said. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> England </PERSON>, authority deputy executive officer for management, said public housing vacancy rates have been reduced from more than 13 percent in July to just under 10 percent in early December. But vandals make the work slower and more expensive. Meanwhile, the homeless, the unemployed and the poor are forced to wait for public housing. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>, for example, there are 170 vacant apartments and a waiting list of 60 renters. In all, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> public housing developments have 1,124 vacancies and a waiting list of 634 applicants, based on December figures.

<HEAD>Study Urges More Freedom, Higher Pay for Government Researchers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> will slip from world-class player to also-ran in biomedical research unless its leaders are given more freedom from the federal bureauracy, a government panel said Monday. Part of that freedom should translate to higher salaries for top researchers even if it means fewer employees doing lower-level work, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> study. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> emphasized at a news conference that the committee's two major recommendations _ a call for a $ 25 million discretionary fund for the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> to use to react quickly to unanticipated research developments, and higher pay at top levels _ could be accomplished without an overall budget increase. While the institutes could use more money, he said, the panel felt strongly that its suggestions were so important they should be implemented even if meant shifting funds around, including `` fewer people better paid.'' `` It's not easy to do and will take more time'' without budget increases, said <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersdorf </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> and a committee member, agreed that `` you can do a lot more with the same amount of money'' if administrators are not bound by congressional directives to maintain a certain number of full-time employees. `` If we do n't do this or something similar, we will end up effectively undermining the effectiveness ... -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and it will no longer be a major force in biomedical research,'' said <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. `` It will not be able to be saved if we wake up 15 years down the line and find that has happened.'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said the panel was not concerned about any quality decline that has occurred up to now. `` We in some sense wept because we said more could have been accomplished,'' he said. `` The domination ... is not what it once was.'' The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, which is a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, said research at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> makes `` invaluable contributions to our knowledge and understanding of basic biological process and their dysfunction in disease.'' The report was prompted by a recommendation from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> research be taken from the government and turned over to private companies. The committee of scientists said `` privatization, in the sense of making the intramural -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> research -RRB- program free-standing and self-supporting, is undesirable and impractical.'' `` None of the common forms of privatization would be as likely to sustain the vitality of the research effort as would a more modest restructuring,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, is a confederation of 12 research institutes, each dedicated to different diseases, types of disorders or speciality areas. Basic discoveries made by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> scientists are made available to anyone and often form the basis of subsequent applications developed by researchers at universities and in private industry. Among the report's recommendations were: _ An increase in salaries for senior researchers who are actively recruited by universities, hospitals and biotechnology companies which pay much higher wages The report said 42 senior scientists in the highest <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> salary range of between $ 77,000 and $ 99,500 were lured away between 1983 and 1988 by salary increases ranging from 50 to 300 percent. _ That <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> charter a foundation to allow private support of up to 10 endowed positions for senior researchers _ That <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> be given more authority independent of its parent agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> The report said attempts by <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> to `` micromanage'' <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> `` are counterproductive and cause <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> to be inefficient in carrying out its mission.'' _ That the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> director receive a $ 25 million discretionary fund to be used to respond quickly to research needs without the current requirement of review by HHS _ That a personnel `` demonstration project'' be authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> flexibility in salaries, benefits and hiring practices This would include a limit on personnel costs, instead of a ceiling on the number of positions, so <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> would have more control over how its personnel dollars are spent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s annual Christmas message: The themes of Christmas and of coming home for the holidays have long been intertwined in song and story. There is a profound irony and lesson in this, because Christmas celebrates the coming of a Savior who was born without a home. There was no room at the inn for the holy family. Weary of travel, a young <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> close to childbirth and her carpenter husband <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> found but the rude shelter of a stable. There was born the King of Kings, the Prince of Peace _ an event on which all history would turn. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> would again be without a home, and more than once; on the flight to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and during his public ministry, when he said, `` The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head.'' From his very infancy on, our Redeemer was reminding us that from then on we would never lack a home in him. Like the shepherds to whom the angel of the Lord appeared on the first Christmas Day, we could always say, `` Let us now go even unto <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.'' As we come home with gladness of family and friends this Christmas, let us also remember our neighbors who can not go home themselves. Our compassion and concern this Christmas and all year long will mean much to the hospitalized, the homeless, the convalescent, the orphaned _ and will surely lead us on our way to the joy and peace of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and the Christ Child who bids us come. For it is only in finding and living the eternal meaning of the Nativity that we can be truly happy, truly at peace, truly home. Merry Christmas, and God bless you! @ s @ <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>

 After 40 years, the thrill of the mystery Christmas coconut is gone for <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinch </PERSON>, but he's still a good sport about it. Every year since 1948, a decorated coconut has been delivered to Clinch as a practical joke from an unknown prankster. The gag is wearing thin now for the 73-year-old victim, even though he still good-naturedly accepts the gift. It started in 1948, with a bunch of buddies, Clinch recalled. `` I came back from the war telling a lot of stories about the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and coconuts. I think one of my pals got an idea from that,'' he said. `` The first year, I took it to a party and we were throwing it around and singing, ` I Ai n't Got Nobody.'''

Clinch said he has blackmailed his buddies, got mad at them and tried every means of persuasion possible to uncover the joker. `` One time, every one of my friends admitted to it. What was I going to do?'' he said. The 1988 coconut was delivered by a local radio station disc jockey. `` It's a never-ending story.

 AIDS is now the ninth leading cause of death among children 1 to 4 years old and the seventh leading cause of deaths among young people age 15 to 24, a federal official said Monday. If present trends continue, said Dr. <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Novello </PERSON>, the disease soon will be the No. 5 killer of Americans from birth to their 24th birthday. In a report to <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Novello </PERSON> said present statistics, `` however tragic, sorely underestimate the true scope of pediatric AIDS.'' As of Dec. 12, 1,291 cases of AIDS had been reported among infants and children under age 13 and an additional 325 cases in the 13-to-19-year group. Of those, 717 who were under 13 at the time of their diagnosis have already died, along with 174 who were adolescents when diagnosed. `` The official figures include only those children whose condition was reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` Probably for every child who meets the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> definition of AIDS, another two to 10 are infected with HIV. It is estimated that by 1991 there will be at least 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infected children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, and health officials are growing increasingly concerned that a large majority of those infected eventually will develop AIDS and die. <PERSON> Novello </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, headed an <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> working group on AIDS among children. Her report to <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said the `` problem of HIV infection among adolescents is enormously greater than the official count suggests.'' `` In view of the lengthy latency period between infection and symptomatic disease, many of the more than 14,000 cases of AIDS reported in persons in their 20s must surely have been contracted when these people were teen-agers,'' she wrote. `` The repercussions of HIV infection in adolescents are magnified by the potential of these sexually active young people to become parents themselves, transmitting the virus to yet another generation.'' Citing demographic data that the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population of people between 11 and 24 years of age `` is unusually small to begin with,'' she said, `` If AIDS were to make serious inroads in this group, the long-term consequences could be disastrous for the nation's economy.''

 <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Branton </PERSON> was eulogized Monday as a crack civil rights lawyer of the 1950s and 1960s whose `` life was dedicated to protecting and defending the constitutional rights of black people.'' A funeral service for <PERSON> Branton </PERSON>, who died here Thursday of a heart attack at age 65, was held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Cathedral. The more than 1,100 mourners, led by <PERSON> Branton </PERSON>'s widow <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON>, included <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, White House national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, wife of Sen.-elect <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va., and daughter of President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Branton </PERSON> will be buried on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bellwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> at his hometown of Pine Bluff, Ark. Reviewing the legal career of his old friend, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Branton </PERSON>'s work as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Voter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> resulted in the registration of more than 600,000 black voters in the South in the 1960s. That cooperative effort helped create the momentum for passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act during the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> administration and `` made possible the election of blacks and a new breed of whites to public office,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Branton </PERSON> has argued his last case, he has written his last brief, he has presented all the evidence and he has made his closing argument,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` ... We the jury find today that <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Branton </PERSON> fought the good fight, finished his case and kept the faith.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Branton </PERSON> as civil rights lawyers in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, during the 1957 struggle to achieve racial desegregation of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said after the service that <PERSON> Branton </PERSON> `` was truly a great American, a terrific lawyer and a tactician who knew what to do for his people, and how to do it.'' After serving as attorney for Freedom Riders, the young civil rights activists who toured the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in the 1960s, <PERSON> Branton </PERSON> was appointed executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and was special assistant to Attorneys General <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzenbach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Amid The Flap Of Wings, Freedom and First Flight For Andean Condors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An excited young Andean condor flapped her wings and took off on her first flight as biologists freed three of the birds into the wild to pave the way for the eventual release of endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors. The three birds were the first of up to 17 Andean condors, donated by various zoos where they were born, that will be freed by late 1989 so scientists can test the techniques they hope to use when they release <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors, which are <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest birds with 9 -LCB- - foot Only 28 endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors remain alive, all in zoos in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Officials are trying to get the carrion-eating vultures to breed in captivity in hopes of starting to reintroduce them into the wild in five to 10 years. The release of the first three Andean birds started last Friday night in a wet and snowy <ORGANIZATION> Hopper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, about 50 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The three birds, living in a net-covered enclosure set into rocks, were placed in a roost box while scientists removed the netting, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologist <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said Monday by phone from <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>. On Saturday morning, `` we opened the door, and the birds walked out single file,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. At first, they stopped where the net had been, then `` did their morning behavior _ stretching their wings and trying to find sun to warm up,'' she added. Then, 8 -LCB- - month-old condor Y1, born at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Animal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and the oldest of the trio, `` seemed to get very excited,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said `` She started flapping her wings, jumping up and down and turning in circles, extending her wings and flapping. ... She turned her head into the breeze, jumped into the air and took her first flight. She spiraled down, trying to soar awkwardly. She landed on some rocks on a side hill beneath the release site.'' The bird `` spent the rest of the day making short flights between various rocks,'' while 6 -LCB- - month-old condor Y3, born at <ORGANIZATION> Patuxent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, `` made some very short flights among the rocks,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said Meanwhile, 6 -RCB- - month-old condor Y2, born at the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- Zoo, roosted on rocks without making a first flight `` They're doing as we expected them to be doing,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. `` We're very pleased with how things are going.'' Four more condors, kept in an enclosure in the nearby Sespe Condor Sanctuary, will be released in late January or February, she added. Efforts to save <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors have cost more than $ 20 million to date. The Andean condor release experiment will cost about $ 440,000, officials have said. Some 1,000 to 2,000 Andean condors remain in the wilds of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Thousands of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors once flew free but their numbers dwindled to the point that four of the last five breeding pairs vanished in 1984-85. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> made a controversial decision to round up the last six wild birds in 1986 to prevent their demise. Their path toward extinction has been blamed on development of condor habitat and lead poisoning from eating carcasses of animals shot by hunters.

<HEAD>Officials Concerned About World Food Supply In 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drought, floods and hurricanes wreaked havoc on world food supplies in 1988, and experts are worried about the outlook for next year, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday. `` The outcome of next year's harvest will be crucial,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Director-General <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> said in his year-end statement. `` In 1989, global cereal output must increase by an unprecedented 225 million tons, or 13 percent, to meet food needs and rebuild stocks to acceptable levels.'' During 1988 he said the world drew heavily from once-abundant food reserves, depleting stocks to the lowest levels since the food crisis of the early 1970s. `` For the first time since World War II, global cereal production has declined in two successive years,'' <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> said. Better harvests in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were unable to offset crop losses in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> also noted a severe drought in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the traditional breadbasket of the world, reduced cereal output by almost a third. Two successive hurricanes took a toll on harvest in some Central American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries, and floods battered crops elsewhere, particularly <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> said the locust invasion in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> was the most extensive in history, but concerted action has limited the potentially enormous damage from the invasion, which is expected to last two or three more years. Food production, he said, has not kept pace with population growth in two-thirds of the countries in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; about half in Latin American, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>; and a third of those in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> are `` facing unusual food shortages and require exceptional food aid,'' he said. `` Our main multilateral food supply for use in times of disasters, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, is exhausted,'' he said. He repeated his proposal to make the voluntary reserve a legally binding convention and to augment the 500,000-ton a year reserve with a standby pledge of 1.5 million tons for emergencies. <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> said a number of low-income, food-deficit countries could have trouble meeting food needs in 1989 because the low stocks have pushed up cereal prices. He also identified foreign indebtedness and agricultural trade barriers as major obstacles for the Third World. Debt servicing alone absorbs more than 40 percent of the export earnings of many developing countries, he said. <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> also characterized 1988 as the worst financial year in <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION>'s 43-year history. He said 80 countries owe the agency $ 111 million, with the largest debtor _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ owing $ 78 million. The Rome-based <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> coordinates agricultural projects in developing countries and is the largest specialized agency in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>China Agrees to Fair Practice Provisions in Satellite Launchings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has agreed to a series of restrictions concerning the terms under which Chinese-produced rocket boosters will launch three American-made communications satellites, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The restrictions basically are aimed at ensuring <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will not be able to compete unfairly against private American launch companies. The agreement was initialed Saturday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Chinese representatives. It apparently sets the stage for AsiaSat, a British-Chinese consortium, and <ORGANIZATION> AUSSAT </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian satellite group, to have the satellites they plan to purchase in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> launched by Chinese rockets. As part of the agreement, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said it would abide by market economy practices in pricing and insurance and would avoid other government inducements, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. She said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also agreed to launch no more than nine communications satellites during the next six years and to distribute launch commitments proportionately during the agreement. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the agreement ensures that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security interests will be fully safeguarded. `` The agreement allows the Chinese to enter the international commercial launch market in accordance with market principles and in a way that will not materially impair the smooth and effective functioning of that market,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major rocket manufacturer, said in a statement Monday it is hopeful that the agreement will mean that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> participation in satellite launchings will be `` fair and non-disruptive.'' Whether the agreement serves that purpose depends on the specifics of how it is implemented, said a company spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified by name. She also called for a broad international agreement on commercial launch services among the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` A level playing field is required if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry is to compete and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access is to be assured,'' she said. No American satellites have ever been launched by a non-Western or communist country. In September, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved the plan, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial launch companies expressed opposition on grounds they would not be able to compete with a country that has a state-run rocket program and does not have to make a profit. The American launch market has picked up since the 1986 Challenger tragedy. Afterward, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered that the space shuttle be used only for military and scientific payloads, making private rocket companies the only alternative for commercial satellite producers.

<HEAD>Survey: 1 In 5 High School Students Smoked Pot, 1 In 2 Drank Last
Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One in five high school students smoked marijuana in the last year, and half took a drink, according to a 24-state survey by an Atlanta-based anti-drug group. The survey also reported findings `` shattering one widely held notion about adolescent drug use'' _ that kids use drugs at school. Less than 2 percent of the students surveyed reported using alcohol or drugs on school premises. `` Students use drugs in their homes, in the homes of friends and in cars, primarily at night and on weekends,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, the author of the report. `` We do n't have a ` school drug problem.' We have a community drug problem.'' The Parents' <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> questioned students in grades 6-12 in 24 states during the 1987-88 school year. More than 203,000 students filled in the group's questionnaire, which was distributed at 302 schools, said PRIDE spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Although the survey is not a scientific sampling, the group believes the results are `` very significant'' because of the large number of students surveyed, from every region in the country, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Students did not sign their names to the questionnaries, which were machine-tabulated by the group to protect confidentiality, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Among high school students, defined as grades 9-12, 20 percent of those surveyed had used marijuana at least once in the previous year. Fifty-eight percent had drunk beer, 56 percent had drunk wine coolers and 46 percent had drunk liquor. Among seniors, 64 percent said they had drunk beer in the previous year. Of the high school high students who drank, 30 percent said they usually got drunk when they did. Four percent of the senior high students had tried cocaine. Thirty-five percent had smoked cigarettes. Among junior high students, 31 percent had tried beer; 30 percent, wine coolers; 18 percent, liquore; 16 percent, marijuana; 1 percent, cocaine; and 22 percent, cigarettes. More than half _ 51 percent _ of all students surveyed said they found beer and wine coolers were at least `` fairly easy'' to obtain. Twenty-six percent said the same for marijuana, and 12 percent said so for cocaine. The questionnaires found some apparent ignorance about the effects of wine coolers. Sixty-five percent of the students surveyed said they were uncertain about any detrimental effects from wine coolers, compared with 56 percent for beer _ although wine coolers, which contain 4 percent to 6 percent alcohol, are more potent than beer, which has an alcoholic content of 3 percent to 4 percent. The students were most likely to drink or to smoke marijuana at home, at a friend's house or in a car. The largest percentages said they had had beer, wine coolers or marijuana at a friend's house, and liquor at home. The survey was conducted among schools in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Survey Predicts Strong Job Market For College Graduates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 College graduates face a happy new year in the job market, according to a leading report released Monday. There will be an an 8 percent increase in corporate demand for graduates with bachelor's degrees, and a 4.6 percent jump in starting salaries, according to <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 43rd annual Lindquist-Endicott Report. The report also predicted new graduates with master's degrees will be sought at a rate 14 percent higher than last year, and their starting salaries will increase 3.5 percent. The 242 business and industrial firms surveyed nationwide for the report painted a rosy picture of the 1989 economy, with 61 percent expecting an improvement over 1988, 36 percent expecting no change, and only 3 percent expecting a downturn, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON>, director of placement at Northwestern and author of the report. `` Corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is confident the economy will remain strong despite concerns by many so-called experts about the volatile stock market, the deficit, trade balance, mega-mergers and the increased competition in the marketplace,'' <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said at a news conference. Technical fields will remain the most lucrative for first-time job-holders, the survey indicates. Starting salaries in engineering fields for holders of bachelor's degrees will increase an average 2.5 percent, from $ 29,856 in 1988 to $ 30,600 in 1989. Those with bachelor's degrees who seek jobs in chemistry-related fields can expect the second-highest starting salaries _ $ 28,488 _ up 5.1 percent from from $ 27,108 in 1988, the survey indicates. But the biggest salary jump will be in sales and marketing, with the $ 25,560 predicted in 1989 up 8.8 percent from the $ 23,484 starting salary for graduates with a bachelor's degree in 1988. Salary increases for new master's degree holders will be up 2.4 percent to 5.8 percent over last spring, he said. The report is considered a leading indicator of job prospects for college graduates. Of about 500 companies that received surveys this year, 242 sent in responses used in the report, <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said. The results have a margin of error of about 3 percentage points, he said. About 70 percent to 80 percent of jobs being created are in the service sector, <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said, but he also expects a resurgence in production. Five percent of firms surveyed reported difficulty meeting minority hiring goals, and the number is expected to triple in five years. The report also showed 47 percent of the employers surveyed use some drug testing, and 7 percent more expect to implement such programs in the next year. `` The drug user, once on the payroll, becomes a very, very costly liability in time lost,'' <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said. When questioned about child-care services, only 2 percent said they pay part of on-site day care for employees' children, 5 percent provide help paying for outside child care, and 29 percent had some sort of referral service for employees. `` I suspect there'll be a tremendous change -LRB- in the number -RRB- by the time we make a report next year,'' <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said. Companies surveyed include major employers in banking, finance and insurance, chemical, electronics, merchandising, public utilities and other industries.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> said Monday it will allow the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to call its representative in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> an ambassador, but will not regard him as such and does not recognize the recently proclaimed Palestinian state. Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> told reporters, however, that his government's position `` comes close to recognition.'' <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said after separate meetings with <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> that he had chosen <PERSON> Daud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> as ambassador to head the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission. <PERSON> Vrantizky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> would be ambassador in title only and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> would double as `` political representative'' to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. They said <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> does not recognize governments without territory, but pledged political and humanitarian support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will include Mr. <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> in the list of ambassadors, but he is not accredited,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greinert </PERSON> said. Because <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> has not extended formal recognition of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state proclaimed Nov. 15 in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> can not present credentials to President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greinert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> received <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at his office in the former <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> imperial palace opposite the chancellery. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> emerged an hour later flashing a V sign with his fingers, but did not make a statement, and was driven off in a police motorcade. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday before leaving for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> hailed the resumption of the U.S.-Palestinian dialogue in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last week and expressed his hope that an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> would be held in the near future under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aegis, the <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s Jews and two other pro-Israeli groups wrote joint letters to <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> and Mock expressing displeasure about the reception given <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on his one-day visit. Mock told reporters the proclaimation of an independent state by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature, and `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s significant speech in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'' to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last ahad had revived prospects for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` We appeal to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to react positively to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s move, which was positively assessed virtually by the entire international community, and to give peace a chance in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said. He praised the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s `` full commitment'' to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as a basis for solution of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict, the renunciation of terrorism and its commitment to the right of all countries in the region to exist within secure borders. The foreign minister criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for what he termed violations of international covenants and `` fundamental freedoms and rights'' in the occupied territories. Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began a rebellion against Israeli rule more than a year ago. `` In the last 1 -LCB- years the fourth <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement on the treatment of the civilian population by a military occupation power has repeatedly been violated by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' Mock declared.

<HEAD>Study Says Two-Year Budgets Would Help Insulate Pentagon From
Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Pentagon budgets should be approved for at least two years at a time as part of the effort to insulate defense spending from political pressures, a private study said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also should streamline its complicated procedures for buying weapons, but should n't do that by creating an entirely new bureaucracy outside the four services, the study concluded. The review, directed by a pair of former defense secretaries, was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, two Washington-based, nonpartisan groups that study policy issues. Co-chairs of the study were <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who each were secretary of defense in the 1970s. The report's recommendations echoed reforms proposed by other studies in the past decade, all of which have called for more stability in the defense budget as way of making more efficient use of taxpayers' money. Defense spending has long been one of the most popular areas for legislators' attention, the study noted. `` Political agendas and ` pork barrel' politics create serious problems for the effective management of defense resources; yet there has been little change in this area to date,'' it said. The study called for two-year budget cycles to replace the current system of annual appropriations. `` Such a move would add greatly to stability in defense programs and make possible more sound and realistic budget planning,'' it said. The report also called for unspecified changes in the way the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> buys weapons. Creation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> offices designed to streamline weapons purchasing has n't done the job, the study said. `` Although the new positions have been created, they have been superimposed upon the old acquisition system without altering the real distribution of power.'' The two-year military budget cycle has been endorsed previously by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said Monday that his committee will look carefully at the nomination of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as secretary of defense in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Tower was <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s predecessor as <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> chairman but that does n't entitle him to any special consideration, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` The committee will have a higher set of standards ... for the entire team,'' from Tower down through the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s top set of managers, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told reporters. Asked if Tower will receive kid-glove treatment at his confirmation hearing, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, `` We are not going to play the old-boy game this go-around.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the panel's ranking Republican, will insist on seeing the full <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower The agency conducted an extensive background investigation following allegations of womanizing and drinking, and reports about Tower's coziness with the defense industry. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he did not want to repeat the mistakes of Tower's early tenure as chairman, when former top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was confirmed. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> now figures prominently in the government's defense procurement fraud case <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also said he plans to introduce legislation early next year providing for a broad new program of voluntary national service for young Americans beginning at age 18. The incoming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, `` wants to make that one of the top priorities for the Democratic majority,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, adding he expects substantial Republican support as well. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he hoped the idea, which would include both military and civilian service and encompass expanded VISTA and Peace Corps programs, could be enacted into law within two years.

 Middle school counselor <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> has invested a lot of time setting students on a course for life. Now he's doing the same thing with his money. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a counselor for seventh - and eighth-grade students at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for 3 -LCB- years, started his own scholarship fund two years ago by donating $ 20,000 _ about half his annual income _ to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> He's pledged to give at least $ 20,000 in each of the next four years until the fund reaches $ 100,000. `` The biggest thing is I see too many students who do n't have any future goals to plan for,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said Monday. `` You have to have some expectations to have something happen.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who earned his master's degree in 1971 in counseling from <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects to award the first scholarship in 1992, using the interest accrued from the investment. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> will administer the trust. Students who attended <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Southeastern or <LOCATION> Kettering </LOCATION> high schools, where <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> formerly taught English, will get priority in the application process. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> area development director, is helping <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> organize the program. `` The important thing he stressed ... is it's just too late when they become seniors,'' she said. `` Many students need the incentive way before their senior year.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duda </PERSON>, who helped his <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> family build one of the nation's largest agricultural empires, has died after a long illness. He was 84. <PERSON> Duda </PERSON>, who died Saturday, worked behind the scenes to design special farming, irrigation and packing equipment that is now widely used in farming on organic soils. What <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons began as a 10-acre farm near <LOCATION> Oviedo </LOCATION> mushroomed into a farming giant from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Today the company is diversified into vegetables, citrus, sugar cane, sod, foliage, cattle and real estate development. As the son of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, the family patriarch who emigrated from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> with his wife and children in 1912, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> and his brothers, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON>, learned about farming from the land. They had no formal training or high school education. Born in <LOCATION> Velcice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> joined the family business in 1926. He retired as corporate vice president in 1976 and served on the Duda board of directors until January of this year. `` They really exemplify a rags-to-riches story,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, retired <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> agricultural extension agent. `` They're the biggest in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and they've definitely left their footprints on agriculture here.'' Last year Forbes magazine listed the <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> family among the 400 richest people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. At least 60 family members share 120,000 acres in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and a vegetable empire worth more than $ 550 million, the magazine said. With annual sales of $ 186 million, <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> is one of the nation's five largest vegetable growers and the biggest in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> corporate spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> disputed the magazine's figures, but said the company's assets are not made public. In recognition of his achievements in agriculture, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> received an honorary doctor of agriculture service degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. Three years later he was installed as a member of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Agriculture Hall of Fame. The Duda family has not been without controversy. Environmentalists have complained that the Dudas polluted <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Apopka </LOCATION> by dumping millions of gallons of polluted water into the lake from their farming operations. The state is now working to clean up the lake and stop the discharge of water from farmland. Survivors include his wife, the former <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicmanec </PERSON>; his brother <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON>; five children from his first wife, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON>, who died in 1974; 19 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Judge Asked To Lift Suspensions Of Dartmouth Students In Classroom
Clash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAVERHILL, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer asked a judge Monday to lift the suspensions of two white <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students for allegedly harassing a black professor, saying the sanctions chilled free speech on campuses nationwide. But a lawyer for the school said the real issue was `` student misconduct.'' `` This is a case with national repercussions,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, a lawyer for the students, both former editors of a conservative, off-campus newspaper. Their cause has attracted support from several nationally known conservatives, including <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The students' classroom confrontation with Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> erupted after the paper, the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, called one of his courses `` one of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s most academically deficient.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school, defended the suspensions, telling <ORGANIZATION> Grafton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> that `` this is a simple case, your honor, of student misconduct.'' `` This is not a case which involves their right to publish,'' <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said. `` It involves a question of civility, which is certainly a reasonable concern on the part of a college community.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> is a private institution and the code of conduct under which it operates ... is a contract between the college and its students,'' <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said. `` This court should exercise great restraint before it acts as a super-disciplinary board.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary panel in March suspended <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, until September 1989 for the confrontation with <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a music professor. A third student received a shorter suspension and a fourth got probation for the February classroom clash, which heightened racial tensions on campus. All four students are white. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> are seeking a preliminary injunction to lift their suspensions. Testimony before <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> was expected to take a week, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruegger </PERSON>, another lawyer for the students. Review staffers said they tried to obtain comment from Cole by telephone on the critical article, but he declined, calling them racist. The staffers said that on advice of the paper's lawyer, they then went to <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s classroom to give him a written statement offering him a chance to respond. The students said <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> cursed and threatened them. <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> should have been punished, not the Review staffers. <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> later asserted that `` Professor <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> is not on trial here.'' <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, the third suspended student and the Review also filed a federal lawsuit charging they were targeted for their outspoken conservative views, such as opposition to affirmative action and women's studies courses at <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>. The case is pending. The Review's supporters include such prominent conservatives as <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, R-N Both senators attended a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference in July to announce the state and federal lawsuits. One critic of the paper, <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, has said that Review staffers are `` ideological provocateurs posing as journalists,'' though he also defended the Review's right to exist. <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> said the paper has been `` a thorn in the side'' of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> administrators, and suggested that the staffers could not get a fair trial from administrators and faculty on the disciplinary panel who themselves have been the paper's targets. <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> dismissed the claim as demeaning to panel members. <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, by denouncing the Review during a campus rally shortly before the disciplinary hearing, fostered `` a lynch-mob atmosphere.'' <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> replied, `` This is great rhetoric, but ... the evidence of this case simply does not support it.'' He said the college disciplinary code _ overhauled after a 1986 incident in which Review staffers took sledgehammers to symbolic anti-apartheid shanties _ excludes the president from the disciplinary process so he can speak out on important matters. <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> also argued that the suspensions were far stiffer than those meted out to other students found guilty of disorderly conduct. <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> countered that the misconduct may be unprecedented in a <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> classroom. Saying the editors `` do not have clean hands,'' <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> noted that they taped telephone conversations with Cole, as well as one of his classes and the confrontation itself, without his consent _ in apparent violation of state law. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> acknowledged the taping, but called it `` common practice'' for journalists. He said that in the recorded telephone conversation between <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> and Cole, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> began yelling before <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> could ask for permission to tape.

<TEXT>
 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> settled their remaining differences Monday and agreed to join in a coalition government, officials from both parties said. The agreement came after seven weeks of haggling following indecisive parliamentary elections Nov. 1 that gave neither <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> nor Labor, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two main political blocs, a clear mandate to govern the country. The agreement, which has not yet been signed, would severely reduce the influence in a new government of the small religious and right-wing parties, who had been negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to form a coalition. During the long negotiations, the religious parties had wrested concessions from <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> that disturbed many Israelis who feared their lives would be too strictly governed by Jewish law. In addition, Jews from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were deeply disturbed by a promise <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> made to push for ammendment of the `` Who-is-a-Jew'' law, which would have narrowed the definition of a Jew to exclude those converted by non-Orthodox rabbis. Most U.S. Jews are not Orthodox. The religious and right-wing partie still could be part of the new government. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was to meet with their leaders Monday night to try to lure them into a broad coalition along with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>. But leaders of the parties expressed the fear that <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> might back out of commitments it made to them earlier. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the agreement would not be signed `` for a day or two'' pending the negotiations with small parties. `` We can not drink ` L'chaim' yet,'' he said, referring to the traditional Hebrew toast meaning `` to life.'' The new government will be similar in many ways to the coalition that has governed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the last four years. An important difference is that it will be headed throughout the four-year term by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. In the last government, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Labor head <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> traded jobs after two years. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> gained the upper hand when it won 40 seats in the 120-seat parliament to Labor's 39. The remaining seats were split among small parties, the majority of whom favor <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. In the new government, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> will be finance minister, while <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> is likely to be made foreign minister, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. Labor's <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> will continue as defense minister. Officials said the two major parties resolved their last remaining difference in a late afternoon meeting, when <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> agreed to give Labor the powerful chairmanship of the parliament's finance committee. Labor had insisted on controlling the position, saying a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> nominee would tie <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' hands in the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Labor agreed to allow <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> final approval of its nomination to the post. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON>, a deputy minister, said his party gave in to Labor and dropped its demand to build 40 new Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Labor agreed to between five and eight settlements, he said. Officials said the broad-based government, which enjoys popular support despite its shortcomings, will enable <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to present a unified front against pressure to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week reversed a longstanding ban on contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, shocking <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials who view the group as a terror organization. `` It -LRB- the government -RRB- will strengthen <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against outside pressure,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said Monday. `` Because it will be a centrist government, it will be able to launch diplomatic initiatives that enjoy the backing of a great majority of the people.'' The small religious parties reacted with anger to reports of the agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor and the possibility that many of their earlier demands would not be met. `` Last week we met with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and he promised us with much festivity that we would get the Education Ministry. We are incensed,'' said <PERSON> Yigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. His party now is unlikely to get the post. With the new agreement, chances for passage of the `` Who-is-a-Jew'' ammendment appeared negligible. Labor opposes the law, and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has not asked Labor to support it. The political program of the new government has yet to be drawn up, and some hardline <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> members already were complaining Monday about Labor's left-leaning policies. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> strongly opposes Labor's land-for-peace proposals, as well as <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' proposal for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. Both Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> oppose talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. However, dovish elements within Labor have begun calling for changing the party platform to allow talks with the group.

 A man already convicted of one murder pleaded guilty Monday to the torture slayings of five other men, whose remains he dismembered and put in curbside trash bags to be hauled off to the city dump. It would be an impossible task, so no effort would be made to find the bodies of the victims of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, following the court hearing. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, 39, pleaded guilty earlier to the murder of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. He pleaded guilty Monday to another first-degree murder charge in the death of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>, and guilty to four other charges of second-degree murder. He was given another life term without chance of parole in <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>'s death, and life sentences in the other four cases. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> said during the 90-minute hearing that he killed <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> in April 1985 by putting a plastic trash bag over his head, tying it with a rope and allowing him to suffocate. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> died the same way. The other victims, killed between 1984 and 1987, died after being bound to a bed, gagged and injected with animal tranquilizers. One of the victims bled to death, <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> said. The other victims were <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, 19; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, 20; <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>, 25; and <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoops </PERSON>, 25. All lived in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area or had <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ties. `` He talked about having certain dark fantasies that came to life,'' said <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON>, adding that no clearer motive emerged from three days of questioning of <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION> last week that led to the plea bargain in which <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> avoided the death penalty. `` He felt abused or misused by certain people, including some of the victims,'' <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON> said. `` There was revenge, or getting control of these people.'' <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, an art collector and operator of a shop that sold art objects and antiques, became a household name in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when he was arrested in April after a man wearing only a dog collar ran screaming from his midtown house. The man told authorities he had been sexually tortured, beaten and injected with drugs by <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>. The arrest was followed by days of digging in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s yard and searching of his rambling house. Two skulls and a bag of teeth were found along with hundreds of photographs of nude and sometimes unconscious men. <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON> said that there were 26 or 27 different men in the pictures and that all had been accounted for except two. No further charges were expected to be filed, <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A former prison official has been indicted on charges he sought political contributions from underlings during <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s rough-and-tumble 1986 gubernatorial election. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, 60, former deputy prison commissioner, was the last of four people indicted following a two-year investigation. <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said all the indictments related to the campaigns of former Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON> and ex-Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Graddick </PERSON>, whose battle for the Democratic nomination for governor went from the voting booth to the courtroom. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who turned himself in Saturday at the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, is charged with illegally influencing the vote or political action of people. He was released in less than an hour on $ 5,000 bond, jail officials said. Indicted on the same charges last week were <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> private investigator <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeomans </PERSON>, Mobile private investigator <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bekurs </PERSON> and state prison Warden <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elmore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Each turned himself in Thursday and was released on $ 5,000 bond. <PERSON> Yeomans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bekurs </PERSON> were campaign aides to <PERSON> Graddick </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bekurs </PERSON> also worked in <PERSON> Graddick </PERSON>'s state office. The indictments accused them of using state-owned electronic equipment to eavesdrop at state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> were accused of ordering subordinates to solicit contributions or make donations to the <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON> campaign. During the 1986 campaign, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> was director of external corrections for the state prison system and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> was his boss, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> resigned the Department of Corrections in early 1987. <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> attorney, and <PERSON> Graddick </PERSON>, a Montgomery investment banker, were out of their offices Monday, their secretaries said, and they could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Graddick </PERSON> led the 1986 Democratic runoff by 8,756 votes over <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON>. But a state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee and the federal courts ruled <PERSON> Graddick </PERSON>'s lead came from illegal Republican crossover votes and they gave <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON> the party's nomination. The resulting voter backlash helped <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> become <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s first Republican governor in 112 years

 The bodies of five Americans killed in a missile attack on their plane by Polisario guerrillas in the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> have been returned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday.

<HEAD>Rate Plan Approved For Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ratepayers may have to absorb up to $ 4.5 billion of the $ 5.5 billion cost of building the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant under a plan that was approved Monday by the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and immediately attacked by consumer groups. The 28-year plan agreed to by <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the commission staff and Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> will base electric rates on how well the plant performs, starting with a 5 percent increase in January. But opponents immediately announced they would challenge the plan in the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, executive director of the consumer group <ORGANIZATION> Toward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normalization </ORGANIZATION>, said ratepayers had been victimized by a `` sellout by the <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION>'' and accused the commission of `` abdicating its responsibility to set just and reasonable rates.'' Diablo Canyon began commercial operation in 1985, 13 years behind schedule and at 17 times its originally planned cost. Design errors, the discovery of the magnitude of the earthquake fault, federal licening problems and legal challenges all contributed to the delay. In its initial assessment, the state commission's consumer staff recommended allowing only $ 1.1 billion of Diablo Canyon to be imposed on ratepayers. In the settlement approved Monday, the commission decided for the first time in state history to base rates for a major power plant on the level of its performance _ the more electricity it produces, the more customers will pay. The commission staff estimates that under terms of the settlement, customers will pay $ 3.5 billion and <ORGANIZATION> PG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E stockholders $ 2 billion. That would represent the largest amount a state regulatory commission has required stockholders to pay for the construction costs of an operating nuclear plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Those figures are based, however, on the average lifetime performance of similar nuclear plants nationwide, operating at 58 percent of capacity. The utility predicts that Diablo Canyon will operate at 65 to 70 percent of capacity, which would add about $ 1 billion to the customers' share. Under the settlement, electric rates are scheduled to rise about 5 percent Jan. 1 and another 1.6 percent in each of the next three years, with additional amounts in those years for inflation in the cost of fuel. Those percentages would be higher in the years after 1989 if the plant operates as well as the utility is forecasting. <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Vial </PERSON> called the plan `` reasonable, consistent with the law and in the public interest.'' He said the utility would have an incentive to operate the plant safely because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would order a shutdown of an unsafe plant. But the plan is opposed by a number of consumer and environmental groups, who argued that mistakes and mismanagement by the utility _ in particular, the failure to detect the magnitude of an earthquake fault near the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> site _ would justify saddling company stockholders, rather than ratepayers, with most of the construction cost. Mothers for Peace, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> group that has led the opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Diablo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION>, said the plan connecting electric rates to performance would create `` a dangerous conflict between plant safety and company profits.''

 A jolly <ORGANIZATION> Benedictine </ORGANIZATION> monk and 21 affluent teen-agers from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> are playing <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> to hundreds of poor families in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>.

Led by former <ORGANIZATION> Delbarton </ORGANIZATION> headmaster <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, or `` Father <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>,'' as he is known, they will spend five days helping distribute clothing and toys to more than 700 families in southeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>.

Donations from the <ORGANIZATION> Delbarton </ORGANIZATION> school make up half of the items going into the Christmas basket program sponsored by the Christian Appalachian Project. Contributions also are sent by families around the country and from individuals and businesses in the area, said Msgr. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Beiting </PERSON>, who set up the non-profit CAP in 1957.

Volunteers, along with a group of students from <ORGANIZATION> Creighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and the boys from <LOCATION> Delbarton </LOCATION> stuffed boxes full of food and presents. `` Poverty in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is off the beaten track,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said before rushing off to <PERSON> Wheelwright </PERSON> to deliver Christmas baskets. `` You drive the roads in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, which are some of the best in the country, and you say, ` Poverty in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?' But you drive off the roads and over a hill and up a hollow and you get a different picture.'' Though <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> admits the school's contributions are only a bandage to the plight of the families, he said that `` immersing'' the <LOCATION> Delbarton </LOCATION> students in poverty will make them more sensitive when they are in a position to do something about it. `` The only way for people to understand poverty is to have a total immersing experience in it, to be present in it,'' he said.

 A federal appeals court has reversed the last of three disciplinary suspensions against the presidents of federal employee unions for actively supporting Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in the 1984 presidential campaign. The ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vacates charges brought in 1985 by the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. After a series of hearings, the board in 1987 ordered <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON>, <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaylock </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, suspended from their government jobs for 60 days under the 1939 Hatch Act. The three men already had been on leave from their jobs at the time of the board's ruling. <PERSON> Blaylock </PERSON>'s suspension was overturned in August by the <ORGANIZATION> 11th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The 1939 law _ aimed at protecting public employees from `` machine'' or coercion politics _ forbids government workers from taking `` an active part in political management or political campaigns.'' The charges were brought after all three union presidents urged their members through union magazines and newspapers to support <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and oppose President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the 1984 election. <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> also urged the respective 310,000 and 350,000 members of their organizations to contribute to union political action committees. In the ruling issued last Friday and made public Monday, a three-judge appeals court panel said the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> failed to show that <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON> had `` acted in concert'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or the Mondale campaign organization. `` It is not enough that the federal employee and the candidate pursue the same political goals independently,'' the court said in the 26-page ruling. `` The two must work in tandem or be linked together for there to be a violation of the Hatch Act.'' <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON>, while holding various union offices, have been on leave from their jobs with the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> since 1959 and 1971, respectively.

The vice president donated a bright, red bat and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a stuffed bear to the workers' `` Toys for Tots'' drive. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a `` fascinating'' meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> two weeks ago, and he called the current period a `` promising time in American history.'' `` I am not euphorically optimistic about that -LRB- U.S.-Soviet -RRB- relationship, but I see enormous opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` What more important assignment does a president have than to work for world peace?'' `` We're in a changing world. We see change inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. We've seen historic change in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> recently. We hope to be seeing more change, inextricable change toward democracy in this hemisphere,'' he said. He told more than 500 workers he will be a president who will `` keep our forces strong and keep our defenses up.'' `` But as we approach Christmas, I think it is important to note that there is peace on earth, certainly between the major powers ... and I'd like to add to that ingredient of good will towards men by working hard to strengthen the peace so that our kids, your kis can grow up in a world with much more promise of peace,'' he said. He predicted `` a rough battle when I get in there in terms of getting this deficit under control. But when I campaigned and said I want this to be a kinder and a gentler nation, I believe it very, very much. And I'm going to work, with the help of all of you to make that promise come through.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked, `` We are very generous in this line of work. You have 48 hours off for Christmas.'' `` Only 24!'' a woman shouted. `` Make that 24 for some departments,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` That makes us double grateful to all of you -LRB- who -RRB- are willing to make that sacrifice to make this inauguration the best one yet.''

<HEAD>Low-Income Families Move Into Renewed Houses In Time For Christmas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two historic row houses once targeted for demolition were turned over to low-income families Monday after a $ 1.5 million renovation that officials said is helping to revitalize a depressed section of north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` It's like a Christmas present to me, because I was in a must-move situation,'' said <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, 26, who had been living with her two sons in a home that recently was condemned. `` This could n't have come at a better time.'' Eleven other families, some living in shelters for the homeless, also will be moving into the brightly lit, blue-carpeted apartments, which were refurbished through a public and private partnership organized by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Profit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> community group. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> is on its way back,'' Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said during ribbon-cutting ceremonies Monday morning. The city provided no-interest loans and tax breaks, and funding came from the <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- East -RRB-. The two houses that once belonged to wealthy 19th-century Philadelphians were renamed the <ORGANIZATION> Waller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after doors were carved through the common wall during renovation. The residents, all of whom earn less than 50 percent of the Philadelphia-area median income, which totals $ 17,400 for a family of four, will pay a maximum of 30 percent of their income for rent and utilities. They had to apply through <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and must abide by rules to keep up the apartments or face eviction, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrell </PERSON>, property manager. `` I am so excited,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. `` If I have to stay up day and night, I'm going to try to get things together, so I can set my Christmas tree up.'' Just a few years ago, the house into which she and her sons moved Monday had been inhabitable. `` The front steps of the building had been stolen,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Magaziner </PERSON>, an architect who helped plan the renovation. `` The doors were bashed in, the windows were busted, rain had been pouring into the building, the roof was leaking.'' A former owner, social worker <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Roye </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, said she saved the building from a wrecking ball in 1982. She drove by one day as a hole was punched in one wall and was able to stop the demolition, she said. City Housing Director <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said he has noticed others taking action because of the renovation work. A number of people whose houses had been condemned in north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> recently asked for a reprieve, offering to reinvest in the community, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said. `` That's a sign that people are sitting up and taking notice,'' he said. The trend is also visible in some large mortgages that banks have approved during the past six months, he said. Anti-drug efforts, job training, improved schools and commercial development also figure into the picture, he said. `` So that gradually the elements that make a viable urban comunity are put into place and people have confidence that they can stay and move here and improve their quality of life.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security officials should take part in a review of Third World debt because of `` enormous problems'' in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> estimates Third World debt as $ 1.32 trillion, including $ 442 billion in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there is concern that private banks have not been lending as much as they might. `` And so I do think that should be subject to a major review which will include not just the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> but our national security people because we've got enormous problems, particularly in our own hemisphere, on Third World debt,'' he said. He did not point to any of the debtor countries, some of which have long histories of military coups. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of possible problems in forgiveness of debt. European creditor governments have forgiven some debt, especially in the poorest countries of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Debts owed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government could only be forgiven if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to do it, which is considered unliklely. Some forgiveness of debt by private banks has also been widely proposed. `` I think you have to be very careful of forgiveness of debt if you want future loans,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` So I think we've got to find a more versatile answer than simply compelling private institutions to write off the debt.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks would be certain to question the legality of any attempt to force them into debt forgiveness. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said forgiveness would dry up the $ 20 billion in additional bank lending urged in 1985 by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who was then treasury secretary. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will be secretary of state under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who has urged some forgiveness, quickly said the rest of the world has known for years that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s ideas were unworkable `` I am happy that the president-elect recognizes that we need a new approach,'' he said in a statement. `` If he is serious about encouraging and supporting economic reform in the developing world, he will have to consider interest or debt reduction in many cases _ as I have argued for six years.'' Fifteen Third World countries with the biggest debts have begun reducing them again, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> reports. These countries, singled out by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in 1985, increased their debt last year by $ 2 billion after reductions in 1985 and 1986. But in the first six months of this year there was a $ 9 billion reduction. The fund's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> did not give a total for the debt of the 15 countries in its study, made available Monday in the official `` <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Survey'' dated Dec. 12. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, sister organization of the fund, released figures on Sunday that added up to $ 519.3 billion for the 15.

 King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> praised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> truce as he led his five <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> allies into the oil giants' first peacetime summit Monday. Leaders resplendent in gold-rimmed cloaks and white turbans heard an opening speech by the Emir of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>, before retiring behind closed doors to focus on accelerating Iran-Iraq peace talks and supporting the quest for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland. `` The summit coincides with the emergence of a climate of peace in the gulf, the end of the war between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Isa </PERSON>. `` We hope this will contribute to normal relations and balanced policies that in turn will return confidence and restore the war-shattered bridges so that peace may be revived.'' All Gulf Council states supported <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the eight-year war that ended in August with a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire. The council was formed at the beginning of that war. It binds <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> in an economic and military pact to strengthen security because of the Iran-Iraq war and <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s threats to export <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> praised Palestinians waging a year-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He also pledged the council's `` unwavering support'' for the state declared in the occupied lands by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He promised the gulf states would help contain <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s protracted civil war and `` salvage the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people. Earlier, <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> lauded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for beginning last week a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` toward a genuine and just peace for the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reversed a 13-year ban on talks with what it called a terrorist organization after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. `` It is perhaps a good omen that the ninth <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> summit is convened in an atmosphere of blissful breakthroughs, namely the end of the war between two Moslem neighbors _ <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ and the commencement of direct negotiations between them.'' Officials said the gulf leaders will discuss economic integration during four-day talks and ways of mustering a united front within the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to help stabilize production and prices. Gulf Council states account for 40 percent of the world's proven oil supplies. Their charter calls for a gulf common market patterned after the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, but critics say progress in that direction has been painfully slow.

<HEAD>Britain to Pay Farmers Millions to Kill Hens, Destroy Eggs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced Monday it will help farmers weather a national scare over food poisoning with payments of more than $ 34 million to destroy millions of young hens and surplus eggs. One British newspaper called the crisis `` the storm in an eggcup.'' It already has cost a deputy health minister her job. Government officials have reported 49 outbreaks of salmonella from eggs affecting 1,000 people, but they say many more cases are unreported. The scare burst into the open Dec. 3 when <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, an outspoken deputy health minister, said most British eggs were tainted by salmonella bacteria, a form of food poisoning that can be fatal in rare cases. Egg sales plummeted by up to 60 percent, and Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> was forced to resign Friday. The same day, the government launched a $ 925,000 advertising campaign to try to make Britons buy eggs again. Under Monday's $ 34.6-million package to bail out producers, the government over the next four weeks will buy 400 million eggs to burn _ the equivalent of two weeks' normal consumption, now unwanted by wary consumers. In addition, 4 million hens will be destroyed, mostly by gassing. That number equals about a tenth of the national laying flock. The bailout will allow farmers to trim their flocks and lower their costs. Opposition legislators and media commentators complained that farmers had no right to a subsidy from the Conservative government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said the government had bowed to farming interests without making it `` conditional on cleaning up their act.'' `` The farmers are a big, powerful lobby, so the government responded to them and shows no concern for members of the public,'' Ms. <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said. `` The storm in an eggcup is a good indication of the Conservatives' instincts,'' commented The Independent, a British national newspaper. `` They decided to protect producers at the expense of consumers and taxpayers.'' Some critics complained that Agriculture Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON>, who announced the payment in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, did nothing to clear up confusion over the extent of the danger. <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> said that if people boil eggs until they are hard and avoid foods made with raw eggs `` then the risks are very, very small indeed.'' Farming organizations said the money, to be given in a single payment, was not enough.

<TEXT>
 Employees of a federally owned uranium-processing plant who still want safety improvements ended a 10-week strike and returned to work Monday for reorientation sessions. The plant's operator, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said the safety and refresher orientations will take much of the week. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said production of uranium, used in other <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plants nationwide for the government's production of nuclear weapons, will resume after the sessions `` It's basically a reorientation, safety sessions, safety training. Before we can restart production, we're going to have to recertify people on a lot of equipment. So it's going to be several days before we're going to start producing,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. Operations at the plant 18 miles northwest of here, formally known as the Feed Materials Production Center, will return to normal after holiday vacations end at the beginning of January, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` I think getting back to work is the beginning of the solution,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a 14-union coalition at the plant. `` We had to get back into the plant to help make things safe and to address some of the other problems.'' <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> officials said as many as 400 employees returned to work Monday. An additional 250 striking employees were laid off two weeks ago because of declining demands from other <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operations for the Fernald plant's uranium. In order to return to work, the unions agreed to separate pending safety grievances with <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> from the three-year contract, which union members approved Saturday by a 3-to-1 ratio. The strike began Oct. 7, halting production. For Monday's reorientation, union workers were bused from the plant's 1,050-acre site to a suburban <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> movie theater to see a film. They returned Monday afternoon to the plant for classroom sessions. Union workers are concerned about exposure to radioactive materials, including uranium and plutonium, a weapons-grade substance to which plant workers occasionally have been exposed in handling wastes accepted for temporary storage from other plants. The unions plan to continue negotiations on a separate agreement covering health and environmental issues. The contract approved Saturday includes a new health insurance program, and no pay increase. Under the agreement, workers may pursue up to 4,000 safety and health grievances against <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, which initially offered to pay workers $ 150 each to drop their grievances. Officials at the 37-year-old plant are under pressure from the state and a lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by plant neighbors, to clean up thousands of pounds and barrels of toxic and radioactive wastes stored on site. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has pledged itself to a cleanup at the plant that is estimated to cost $ 1 billion, and has begun some cleanup work and studies. But political leaders, employees and neighbors are concerned that a long-term report, issued last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, recommends closing <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> in a few years. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, has said he thinks the cleanup will get a higher priority if the plant remains open.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with television evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> at a time when he was gearing up for his presidential run against another TV preacher, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, but a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman said Monday the vice president `` did n't ask for anything or promise anything.'' Comments by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s onetime press secretary <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> left some confusion over the purpose for the November 1985 meeting at <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who attended the meeting, initially told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> press briefing Monday that it was to seek support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s forthcoming presidential But later he said he had misspoken and that the meeting was not political, but rather was in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capacity as vice president _ `` a standard meeting of the kind that we had hundreds of The vice president did n't ask for anything or promise anything.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential press secretary and will be <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> press secretary when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office in January, made the comments at his daily briefing at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where he is currently President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman. His account conflicted with that of <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, who at the time of the Bush-Bakker meeting was working as a marketing consultant for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was part of `` coalition building'' for the future presidential race and that the vice president met with many evangelical leaders for the same purpose, including the Rev. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuler </PERSON>. `` Those things were done every day. ... It did n't matter where you were _ <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> _ if you could meet with some people who were active politically, you tried to sit down and talk with them,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said in telephone interview. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, answering questions at Monday's briefing, initially had said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` was seeking his support for the campaign, absolutely. ... You have hundreds of meetings like that when you're running for president. Later <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that was not the correct characterization, that the only support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought was for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policies. In March 1987, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stepped down from his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, as his sexual involvement with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> created headlines. At the time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met him, there had been no disclosure of such activity by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. A report Sunday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> contained an allegation by former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> bodyguard <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardister </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> talked about a possible admihistration job for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. Asked about that report, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters, `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> thought. There was no talk of jobs or payoffs or anything else. It was a simple meeting as the vice president had with hundreds of other people and individuals asking their support ... asking his support for various policies and so forth. `` They talked about their Christian beliefs. They talked about the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign. It was just a friendly discussion,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told the briefing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, in November 1985, as he was looking ahead to his race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. Eventually he defeated <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, host of the popular `` 700 Club'' Christian television show, in the primaries. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces had been concerned about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s unknown potential to pull votes from the religious right. Besides <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own meeting with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, the vice president had three close associates whom <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> hired as consultants: <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>; <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Weed </PERSON>, a sometime guest host on the `` 700 Club'' who worked as a liaison for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign with religious groups; and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Weed currently works for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential transition staff as a liaison with religious groups. <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, who acknowledged earning $ 120,000 for his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> work, said his work for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> pertained to marketing and had no relation to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or politics.

 An 11-year-old Palestinian boy died Monday from head injuries that his family said he suffered when he was pushed from a military jeep in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. An army spokesman confirmed the boy died but said a preliminary investigation revealed no connection between the boy's death and the army. He said the army was still investigating. In other violence, troops shot and wounded nine Palestinians in clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officals said. The clashes took place in the refugee camps of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and Nusseirat, where soldiers opened fire on dozens of masked youths who hurled rocks at army patrols, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Palestinian doctors said 11-year-old Badr <LOCATION> Karada </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> died at east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of trauma injuries to the head, which he suffered Dec. 10. They said relatives told them he was pushed from an army jeep after being detained by troops. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said the boy was first brought there by residents of the city's <LOCATION> Sumara </LOCATION> neighborhood who said they saw the child pushed out of an army jeep. The hospital officials said relatives claimed <LOCATION> Karada </LOCATION> was detained while riding his bicycle near his home in <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ein </PERSON>, a neighborhood about a half - mile from where he allegedly was pushed from the jeep `` We're not aware of any eyewitness reports that would connect this boy to falling off a jeep or even being held by soldiers,'' the army spokesman said. `` We are looking for someone who saw this.'' Before Monday's death, 332 Palestinians had been killed during the year-long <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Thirteen Israelis also have been killed. Also Monday, Palestinians shut shops and schools on the third day of a general strike throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The army imposed or maintained curfews on at least eight towns and refugee camps that were scenes of unrest Sunday, the Arab reports said. Left-wing Israelis, meanwhile, announced formation of a human rights group to monitor abuses in the occupied territories. The group was named <PERSON> Betzelim </PERSON>, or `` image'' in English, a reference to the biblical phrase `` God created man in his own image.'' `` We formed the group to save the human image of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, that's why we chose this name,'' <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamor </PERSON>, one of the founders, said in an interview She said the organization of about 60 leftist authors, journalists and lawyers would collect affidavits and statements about abuses, as well as lobby parliament about human rights violations. In another development, the attorney general's office ordered an investigation into a complaint by two brothers from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Taibe </LOCATION> that they were severely beaten by agents of the Shin Bet security service, the Hebrew-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabli </PERSON> said they were beaten while detained on charges of illegal possession of weapons, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Palme's Widow Identified Murder Suspect, TV Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The widow of assassinated Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> picked out of a police lineup a 41-year-old Swede suspected of his murder, Swedish TV reported Monday. The Channel 2 news program `` Rapport'' quoted an unidentified, `` well-connected'' source close to the investigation as saying that Mrs. <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Petterson </PERSON> as the killer. Palme was shot from behind on Feb. 28, 1986, on a central <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> street as he and his wife were walking home unguarded from a movie after saying good night to their son <PERSON> Marten </PERSON>, who saw the movie with them. According to the broadcast, the source said both Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> and her son identified the suspect with varying degrees of certainty, but it gave no details. After the murder, the son reported having seen a man who appeared to be following his parents. <PERSON> Petterson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON>; the prosecutor, and police heading the investigation said they had no comment on the TV report. `` Rapport'' did not say when the lineup took place, but it apparently would have been either Sunday or Monday. <PERSON> Petterson </PERSON>, who has a long criminal record including a manslaughter conviction, was arrested on Wednesday. He pleaded innocent, but a district court judge found the prosecution had shown reasonable grounds to suspect him of <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s murder and ordered him held for investigation. Both sides agreed, however, that publication of <PERSON> Petterson </PERSON>'s picture in the foreign press and the fact that nearly three years passed since the shooting assassination weakened the value of witness identification No reports emerged of any admissions made during interrogation or that the police uncovered more tangible evidence, such as the revolver used in the shooting. A scandal stemming from the murder investigation ended Monday when the state awarded partial payment of a private investigator's bill The amateur detective, book publisher <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, will get $ 4,107 of a $ 200,875 expense account he submitted, the national <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The disclosure of <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s private search and his attempt to smuggle illegal surveillance equipment into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> triggered a political crisis for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government. It forced the resignation last June of Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON>, who secretly backed the project.

<HEAD>Technician Testifies Hairs Forcibly Removed From Lisa's Head</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hairs that were yanked out of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s head were found entangled in clothing fibers of the man accused of beating her to death, a police laboratory technician testified Monday Detective <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Callery </PERSON> said he also found hair from <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s former live-in companion, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, on the exercise bar police confiscated during a search of the couple's <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, testified two weeks ago that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> beat her on her legs and head with the bar. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with second-degree murder in the fatal beating of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, a child he and Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> illegally adopted shortly after her birth. Another prosecution witness, a neighbor of the couple, testified Monday that she heard slapping and screaming at various times coming from the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> apartment before the night <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was fatally injured. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death in an affluent, well-educated household attracted wide attention and raised the issue of the responsibility of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse. <PERSON> Callery </PERSON> said the hair found in <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s clothing `` in my opinion, came from <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>.'' He added that for hair to be entangled in clothing fibers `` there is usually some kind of struggle.'' <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s two lawyers, said outside the courtroom after he cross-examined <PERSON> Callery </PERSON> that the technician's testimony was irrelevant `` You ca n't put any times on when the hair came off the head or even the circumstances under which it came off,'' <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was removed unconscious from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s apartment the morning of Nov. 2, 1987, and taken to a nearby hospital where she died three days later. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> denies that he hit the girl, but Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s former live-in companion, said he told her the night <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was fatally injured that he had `` knocked <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> down and she did n't want to get up.'' The former neighbor who testified Monday, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonano </PERSON>, said she called police three or four times after hearing yelling and sounds of violence coming from the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> apartment two floors above her ground-floor flat. `` I heard noises like slapping, screaming, loud male voices, like yelling,'' she testified. Mrs. <PERSON> Bonano </PERSON> also testifed that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> appeared increasingly battered in the years before <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> died, and that by November 1987, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was limping. Charges against Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> were dropped after prosecutors concluded she was too badly battered to have prevented <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death.

<HEAD>Federal Regulators Offer Cities Foreclosed Properties To House
Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal regulators said Monday they are offering to make foreclosed properties from failed savings institutions available to house the homeless in a half dozen cities. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, said the agency, which regulates the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, is talking with six or seven cities in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and in the North and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. He declined to identify them. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said the bank board would lend the properties _ in some cases commercial buildings near soup kitchens _ to municipal governments, which in turn would pay to administer them as temporary shelters. `` That ball is in their court at this juncture. They have to decide if they have the funds,'' he said. `` We would like to get it done in the winter when this housing would be most useful to the homeless.'' Discussions with the cities started several months ago, <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said. Another effort, to persuade private groups to purchase foreclosed homes from the bank board and rehabilitate them for poor families, began about a year ago, he said. Wall disclosed the homeless initiative in a speech to a group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on the same day that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in announcing the appointment of Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, as secretary of housing and urban development, said his administration would seek innovative solutions to the problem of homelessness. On another topic, <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said the bank board late Monday forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> the outline of a plan for a `` reinsurance agency'' that would serve as a mechanism for channeling funds to the ailing S & amp; L industry. The bank board's insurance fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has been paying for a record number of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescues this year through its normal income, primarily an assessment on still-operating institutions. Wall has argued previously that the fees paid by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, as well as by banks and credit unions to separate insurance funds, were meant to cover a `` normal'' level of failures, not the `` catastrophic'' level of the current thrift crisis. Through Monday, regulators said they have resolved the cases of 159 insolvent thrifts this year. More than 400 insolvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls remain open and hundreds of others are close to insolvency. According to an administration source, who declined to be named, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates the cost of restoring the thrift industry to health at $ 60 billion to $ 75 billion if interest rates remain unchanged and as high as $ 105 billion if interest rates increase by 2 percentage points. The reinsurance agency would have oversight over three insurance funds _ for banks, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and credit unions. It could collect premiums from all three agencies, using it when one of the funds got in trouble. It also could serve as the mechanism for further borrowing to pay for the thrift crisis or as the conduit for any money <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted to spend on the cleanup. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, in an interview, said the proposal leaves open who will pay for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L cleanup and whether the new agency's expenditures would be counted toward the budget deficit. `` I do n't think it is intended to a back door way off getting them -LRB- banks and credit unions -RRB- to pay for the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s current problems,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` The concept is both a funding mechanism and a forward looking means of dealing with catastrophic costs'' in the future. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in weekend editions that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in its 1990 budget, will acknowledge for the first time that some taxpayer money must be spent on the problem.

 A member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements which led to PLO-U.S. talks were only `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s personal opinion.'' The statement could represent a serious policy split within the ranks of the governing body of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Israeli Premier <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told a conference on the Nazi Holocaust on Monday that the latest <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statements about peace were a trick and said worldwide support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was needed to prevent `` a future holocaust.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were deluded into accepting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and vowed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would never negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization which includes <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream Fatah group. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is made up of terrorists bent on driving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into the sea. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Zibri </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> explicitly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renouncing all forms of terrorism, were `` incompatible with the resolutions of the latest <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting.'' He signed the statement with his guerrilla name, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON>. The statement was telefaxed from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, to The Associated Press office in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The office of the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> confirmed that he issued the statement. The statement could represent serious dissent because of <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>'s seat on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-member governing body, which includes representatives of six Palestinian guerrilla groups as well as independents Fatah has three seats. <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON> is the sole committee representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist group headed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>. It was not known immediately whether <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> endorsed his statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative arm, met in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> last month to declare an independent Palestinian state. It implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence and renounced terrorism, but it said it would continue attacking Israeli military targets in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> later told <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, `` We're backing your efforts because this is what the majority wants. But we do n't believe moderation will pay.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> recognizes the right of all parties to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict `` to exist in peace and security ... including the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other neighbors.'' He also said, `` We totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and state terrorism.'' He uses the term `` state terrorism'' to refer to activities by the Israeli defense forces. His statements led to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> announcement that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for direct contact and to the opening of U.S.-PLO talks in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision was only taken to end American isolation and said `` we urge our masses to keep up the struggle to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to recognize the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Zibry </PERSON>'s statement Monday said, `` The statements made by ... -LRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> -RRB- in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> were incompatible with the resolutions of the latest <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> meeting and he -LRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> -RRB- expressed only his personal opinion.'' `` His statements only whetted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appetite to extort -LRB- concessions from -RRB- the Palestinian revolution and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still seeking to scuttle the intefadeh,'' he said, using the Arabic word for the year-old uprising of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip. `` We shall continue to exercise our legitimate rights ... in struggling against the occupation with all means available, including armed struggle, until ... establishment of the independent Palestinian state on soil of the homeland.''

 Novelist <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> declared Monday that the defeat of military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in a political referendum was `` an historic moment'' and that democracy has been restored to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. She made the comments at a news conference in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> during her first trip back to her homeland after 13 years of self-imposed exile. The author of the best-selling `` House of the Spirits'' also said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is a dictator like others who have ruled Latin American countries. `` I'm not really interested in talking about him personally because he's no different from other cases and is not a particularly interesting person.'' However, she said she wept when she learned in October that Chileans rejected by 3.9 million to 3.1 million a proposal that Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remain in power until 1997. `` I believe the silent decision that every Chilean made on Oct. 5 is an historic moment in the return of democracy,'' she said. She was in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> at the time and telephoned <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> to discuss the results with <PERSON> Hortensia </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, widow of ousted civilian President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. `` We could n't talk, we just cried,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s father was a cousin of <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, the Marxist who died when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> toppled his elected government in a bloody 1973 coup. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s referendum defeat obliged him to call elections for next December. He is to hand over power in March 1990. Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, 46, has written three novels since she left <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in 1975 for self-exile in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, where she remained for 13 years. This year, she moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. She returned to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> on Saturday for a two-week visit with family and said of her homeland: `` It feels the same, like not a day has passed.'' But she said she had no plans to re-establish residence in the country. She said that while abroad `` every time I've had a chance to talk publicly about <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and condemn the dictatorship I've done so.'' `` I believe my mission ends with the arrival of democracy in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' she said, adding: `` I believe it has arrived.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> said she now is preparing a book of short stories, including material culled from her third and latest novel, `` <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>.'' The book describes the experiences of an uneducated but savvy peasant girl who seeks her fortune in a Venezuelan city. `` House of the Spirits,'' which was published in more than a dozen languages, is the saga of several generations of a Chilean family living in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Asked to comment on critics who compare her work with that of renowned Colombian author <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, she quipped: `` This must make <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> unhappy.'' She said she is influenced by <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neruda </PERSON>, the late Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet. She said her work and <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>' share only a style known as `` magical realism'' which mixes fantasy with reality.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is capable of producing chemical weapons and `` is on the verge of full-scale production,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Registering concern, spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> urged all nations to deny technology to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and also <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. She said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had severed its connection with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s chemical weapons facility. Meanwhile, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, director of the department's counter-terrorism office, cited two reasons for concern about <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> `` This is a country which has a longstanding, close relationship with some of the world's most murderous terrorist groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, -LRB- Palestinian radical -RRB- <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Second, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has been willing in the past to provide very destructive weapons to those groups without apparent concern how much damage they could do.'' <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, in an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interview, cited the supply of SA-7 surface-to-air missiles and plastic explosives manufactured in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no evidence that the Libyans have exercised any self-restraint on themselves,'' he said. `` The fact you've got the Libyans with a chemical weapons capability, the historic ties and the propensity to turn heavy-duty stuff over to terrorists makes it a concern-raising situation.'' <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said there was no evidence yet that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had provided chemical agents to terrorists. `` It just is n't there,'' he said. But, he added, `` you have to be concerned they either would turn it over or use it themselves against another state.'' Published reports place the chemical facility in the recesses of a mountain chain 35 miles from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern is heightened by <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s anti-Israel stance and the country's alleged record of terrorist activities. American warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the Libyan capital, in April 1986 in retaliation. A daughter of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> died in the air raid. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> gave no indication the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is contemplating the use of force or would support others if they tried to disable the facility. She noted that an international conference would be held in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Jan. 7 to discuss the proliferation of chemical weapons technology and that a disarmament conference would take up the problem in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in February. `` We continue to call upon all nations to halt any contribution they might be making to the Libyan chemical weapons capability, and to take vigorous actions to curb the illicit use of chemical weapons and their further proliferation,'' the spokeswoman said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, seeking to isolate and weaken <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, has barred export of American technology to the North African country. It has also tried to persuade other nations to deny chemical weapons equipment to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which were accused by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of using chemical weapons against each other's forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. The Washington Post, in a story Monday, quoted unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli analysts as fearing <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> `` may be planning to provide radical Palestinian or Japanese terrorists with the wherewithal to launch the first chemical attack on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or Israeli interests somewhere in the world.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>'s statement did not deal with specific <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns. But she stressed that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is very concerned about the spread of chemical weapons and the capability of spreading chemical weapons in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' She also registered concern about a proliferation of ballistic missiles in the region. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> believes that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has established a <ORGANIZATION> CW </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- chemical weapons -RRB- production capability and it's on the verge of full-scale production of these weapons,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. She said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had given assurances that its nationals were not working at the Libyan facility and that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> planned no further involvement with a metallurgical plant that may have been connected to the chemical weapons program. She said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was fulfilling its pledge. After <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> charged <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> two months ago with developing the capability for chemical warfare, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> sent a memorandum to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> denying the allegation.

 <LOCATION> CAGNES-SUR-MER </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Two explosions wrecked a home for immigrant workers Monday on the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, killing one resident and injuring 12, police said. Authorities said they found evidence that may link the blasts to Jewish extremists. They said the first pre-dawn blast demolished a car parked at the entrance of the building, which housed 97 people, mostly North African immigrants. Residents were rushing outside when a second explosion minutes later ripped through a stairwell, killing a Romanian immigrant. The victim was identified as <PERSON> Georghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Yordachescu </PERSON>, 50, a delivery driver who had lived there about four years. Firemen said they found written tracts in the rubble from an extreme right-wing Jewish group called <LOCATION> Masada </LOCATION>. The writings contained the words `` Islam Must Be Beaten.'' Tracts from <LOCATION> Masada </LOCATION>, named after a mountaintop fortress in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> held by Jews against Roman legions, were found last June outside another immigrants' residence in nearby Nice when a bomb was defused, police said. However, no explicit claim of responsibility was made by any organization for Monday's explosions. The first blast hurled chunks of the parked car up to 300 feet away, destroyed four other cars and damaged numerous vehicles. The concussion broke windows in nearby buildings. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> condemned the attack, saying: `` Once again, the cowardice of a few struck immigrant workers. This violence must be denounced and fought with the greatest firmness.'' Foreign immigrants, especially those from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, have often been made targets of resentment and prejudice in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. An employee of a transportation company next door to the residence reported, `` We were drinking coffee with a colleague when the explosion blew out the door and all of the windows. We ran outside and we saw that terrified residents of the center wanted to jump from the windows. `` We shouted to them to remain in the building and we approached it to help them. It was at that moment that the second explosion happened. I was thrown 10 meters -LRB- about 33 feet -RRB- and my colleague was hit full in the head by a piece of flying metal.'' Six of those hurt required hospitalization. <ORGANIZATION> Cagnes-sur-Mer </ORGANIZATION> is about six miles west of <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. The ground floor was badly damaged. Dozens of rooms were destroyed and enormous pieces of concrete were sent flying. Some of those hurt suffered broken bones and cuts. Some had jumped from the windows. Residents regrouped around a fire built in front of the building. `` We never received any threats,'' one said. `` Everything was just fine at the center. We do n't understand this attack.''

<TEXT>
 A reward of nearly $ 7,000 was announced Monday in hopes of finding out who is responsible for the deaths of three cougars that were part of a program to re-establish endangered <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panthers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said that he and state and private game officials hope to raise more money to get the reward up to $ 10,000. Three of five cougars caught in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and released into the <ORGANIZATION> Osceola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in June have died, threatening the state-federal program aimed at finding a new habitat for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panthers. Hunters have been blamed in two of the cougar deaths, while the cause of the third death could not be determined, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, chief of wildlife research for the game and fish commission. The two remaining cougars are believed to be in good health. Fewer than 30 panthers are believed to be remaining in the swamps and scrubland of central and southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, as their natural habitat is chipped away by development. That is why wildlife authorities are attempting to establish panthers in the <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION> forest in north-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. They brought the five cougars, which have habits similar to those of the endangered panthers, to the forest to see how well they adapt. State officials have no firm leads in the deaths but expect the reward money may help, said <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think at this point, the only real possibility of getting a conviction is if somebody comes forward,'' said <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>. `` Most of the time when people do something like this, they're going to talk about it.'' Conviction of killing one of the cougars carries a possible prison sentence of five years and fine of up to $ 5,000.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s leftist guerrilla groups wants to abandon armed rebellion and become a political party, a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper reported on Monday. The report in the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION> follows President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s Sept. 1 offer of freedom of political activity to leftist rebel bands who give up armed revolt. El Siglo quoted Sen. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcedo </PERSON> as saying the April 19 Movement, or M-19, has proposed immediate talks with the government and that the group wants to disband and organize a party within six months. `` The conditions are right for achieving an agreement between the government and the M-19 in the next three months,'' <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcedo </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tried to call <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcedo </PERSON> at his office, but there was no answer. Parliament adjourned last week. In the last two months, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siglo </LOCATION> has been the medium for several announcements by leftist guerrilla groups proposing peace talks with the government. Earlier this year, M-19 kidnapped <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s leading member of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and owner of <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Siglo </PERSON>, who ran against <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> for president two years ago. He was released after two weeks with a message from M-19 that it was interested in peace talks with the government. Last week, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told the final session of Parliament that members of his Cabinet have been in direct contact with M-19. M-19 made its proposal during such contacts this month, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Siglo </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcedo </PERSON> as saying. The senator and <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> both belong to the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Right-wing death squads have ravaged the ranks of a political party that was organized three years ago with the help of rebels from the Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. The squads killed 800 members of that party, the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, including its president, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>. The Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> made known last month through another federal senator that it, too, would like to enter into peace talks with the government. Two other rebel groups, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said in communiques they will never give up trying to overthrow the government. Those two groups launched a major offensive last January. There are an estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. M-19 has been inactive for the last six months. It takes its name from the date of a 1970 presidential election that dissidents say was fraudulent. M-19's bloodiest operation was seizing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> in 1985. The army retook the building, but 11 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices and 85 other people were killed.

 A high school mathematics teacher who repeatedly defied a new dress code requiring him to wear a tie was fired Monday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> voted to fire teacher <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> for insubordination, accepting a recommendation of school Superintendent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>. Earlier, the board had delayed action on Chambers' recommendation pending a closed-door session last week. `` First of all, we'll file the necessary papers for appeal,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said Monday night. `` I have work I have contracted to do in my body shop, and probably after the first of the year, I will go hunt a job.'' The 46-year-old teacher, who lives in <LOCATION> Gallipolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and owns a farm and a body shop there, had said he expected to be fired. He had already been suspended three times for not wearing a tie, and the dipute engendered considerable controversy in <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` I felt all along that the board would back the superintendent on his recommendation,'' he said. In August, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> issued a memo saying male teachers would have to wear ties to work and that all teachers were prohibited from wearing denim. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was suspended for four days with pay in September when he refused to wear a tie after Principal <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> asked him to do so. In October, he was suspended for 11 days without pay, and on Halloweeen the board suspended him indefinitely without pay. A state hearing examiner has heard evidence on the second suspension and a decision is expected by Jan. 5.

 A woman described by prosecutors as a gold-digger who helped bury businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> alive in hopes of sharing a $ 1 million ransom was sentenced Monday to life in prison without parole. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> was convicted Nov. 2 of murder and kidnapping for her role in the 1987 abduction of Small, member of a prominent publishing family, who suffocated in a homemade wooden box before the money could be collected. Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON>, 26, cried and hugged her mother when Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michela </PERSON> pronounced the sentence after a hearing in <ORGANIZATION> Kankakee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Her boyfriend, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, was convicted of murder and kidnapping in May and sentenced to die, but prosecutors said Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> was not eligible for the death penalty. `` There was not one grain of remorse, not one grain of salt in the tears of this woman for <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> and his family,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attorney general, told the judge. Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> told <PERSON> Michela </PERSON> that witnesses against her lied and her conviction was unfair. `` I just want to say I'm not guilty of those charges and I never was,'' she said. Small, 40, was kidnapped Sept. 2, 1987 and buried in the box in a remote area between <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> border. His body was unearthed two days later. Small's late father was head of <ORGANIZATION> Mid-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, whose broadcasting properties included 11 radio stations, and his uncle was head of <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and editor and publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Kankakee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> wanted a lot of money, `` the big score,'' and decided kidnapping Small was the way to get it. However, the defense maintained that <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' real accomplices never were apprehended. During the trial, the jury saw photos of Small's body inside the box, and heard chilling tapes of a kidnapper warning that Small would die if the ransom was not paid. The ransom was never paid because Small's wife could not understand the delivery instructions on the muffled tape recording played to her over the telephone.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Asks for 70 Peacekeepers to Oversee Cuban Withdrawal

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Monday asked the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to approve a 70-member peacekeeping force to monitor the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The council is expected to give its approval by Thursday for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, which a report by the secretary-general said would cost about $ 20.4 million during the 31-month phased pullout. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> are expected to sign on Thursday a final pact to cooperate with the force and a final agreement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on the southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> peace plan. Under the plan, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is to allow independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the former German colony known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>; Cuban troops are to withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and South African troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has controlled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in defiance of a 1966 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution demanding the territory's independence. The 70-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> asked for is separate and officially unrelated to a much larger force of 7,500 peacekeepers and 2,000 military police and civilian administrators planned to monitor Namibian independence. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s report did not suggest which nations would provide military observers for the unarmed force. But Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was quoted by a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> newspaper as saying his country has agreed to send troops to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy satellites are expected to provide much of the intelligence data that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> insists on during the Cuban withdrawal. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s state news agency quoted President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> as saying that <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is trying to create a fund to finance the Cuban withdrawal. In a meeting in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said it would cost about $ 800 million, the agency said. Cuban troops went to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1975 to help the Marxist government fight attacks by South African forces and U.S.-backed rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. In a statement issued from their <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> headquarters Monday, the rebels claimed they killed 13 Angolan soldiers and captured the northwestern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ucua </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> province, last week. The rebels said they killed eight government soldiers Thursday when they attacked a military column in the southern <LOCATION> Huila </LOCATION> province and destroyed 12 tons of arms. One rebel died and seven were injured in the clashes, they said. There was no way to immediately verify claims of the rebels, who are not party to the U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.

 Seven Democrats and 11 Republicans are now seeking the mayor's office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but the rumored candidacy of former Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> did not materialize before the Monday deadline for filing nomination petitions. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a Democrat who was the city's mayor from 1979 to 1983, had been reported in recent days to be a potential <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate. But her daughter, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, showed up at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> minutes before the deadline Monday with a denial. `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> is not a candidate. Merry Christmas,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> told reporters, then departed. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> powerhouse turned Republican who was also said to be thinking about running, sent an aide to tell reporters minutes before the filing deadline that he, too, was n't interested `` Leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> urged me to consider a candidacy and I did so as a courtesy to my party,'' <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Instead, I will concentrate my time and energy on my law practice and on assisting to build the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' That left the Republicans without a big-name candidate for the Feb. 28 primary. On the Democratic side, Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, named to the post by the city council after <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> died in November 1987, squared off against a field that included <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the legendary Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> Though the deadline for primary candidates ended Monday, independent candidates have until mid-January to file for the remaining two years in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second term. Other Democratic candidates are aldermen <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliz </PERSON>; former state Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a follower of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. Republican candidates include <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, a physician-lawyer who ran unsuccessfully three times against veteran <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>; <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to try to get the election put off until 1989; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holowinski </PERSON>, a former Democrat employed by the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Winning the Democratic primary has been tantamount to winning the general election in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s recent history, although a white Republican made a strong showing against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the city's first black mayor Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was derailed in a 1983 re-election bid when she and <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> split the white vote, making <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate. He went on to win the general election and become the city's first black mayor. The racial issue remains alive in the 1988 campaign. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who are black, are battling to represent the black community, although <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has begun campaigning hard for the black vote. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and said he is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s true political heir. The city's population is a little more than 40 percent white, 40 percent black, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent of other races.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which last week opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday it would judge <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism on a `` case-by-case'' basis. `` Terrorism has been renounced in words,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` We shall see what happens now.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> declined to comment directly on an assertion by <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism `` in all forms'' did not include military attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Our struggle will continue until we raise the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flag over <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, known also as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, said Sunday. He is second-in-command to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream body of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee, <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Zibri </PERSON>, said in a statement Monday that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements explicitly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renouncing all forms of terrorism were `` incompatible with the resolutions of the latest <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting,'' and they were just <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s `` personal opinion. <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>'s statement could represent a serious policy split within the ranks of the 15-member governing body of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which includes representatives of six Palestinian guerrilla groups as well as independents. Meanwhile, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday in a brief exchange with reporters that `` we would not start off by showing any tolerance of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> terror and I do n't care if it comes from a faction of the left or right or the center or whatever. ... I am concerned about it; I have been and will continue to be concerned about it.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined comment on <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>'s remarks, saying, `` I do n't need to tell you of the commotion that this development has made in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs, and we just are n't going to prejudice the process in any way at this point.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism at a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was one of the reasons cited by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> for deciding to hold <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. This reversed a 13-year ban and dismayed Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials as a regrettable move that would not advance prospects for peace in the area. The first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> session with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was held Friday in <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>, an ancient city near <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> founded by the Phoenicians. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said `` we have no further meetings planned at this point.'' On Saturday, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the `` dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would be suspended in the event of terrorism incidents that were traceable to the group. `` We would look at all this on a case-by-case basis,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` And I am not going to get into the area of speculation about what specific views we might have.'' At the same time, she said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was `` deeply concerned'' about an upsurge of violence on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Troops killed three Palestinian Arabs on Sunday, raising to eight the death toll over a bloody weekend. Authorities said <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> stoned three Jewish residents, including a 9-month-old girl and 4-year-old boy. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had `` given legitimization to the uprising in the territories.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said there was no way to determine if the increased violence was linked to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> contends is behind the attacks on Israeli troops and settlers. However, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official admonished <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not to engage in `` excessive use of force'' on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>'s statement, issued from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> `` expressed only his personal opinion. He signed the statement with his guerrilla name, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON>. `` His statements only whetted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appetite to extort -LRB- concessions from -RRB- the Palestinian revolution and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON> said. `` We shall continue to exercise our legitimate rights ... in struggling against the occupation with all means available, including armed struggle, until ... establishment of the independent Palestinian state on soil of the homeland.'' <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON> is the sole representative on the executive committee from the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist group headed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>. It was not known immediately whether <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> endorsed his statement. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> declined comment Monday night on <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>'s statement.

 An accountant for a carpet-cleaning company that bilked investors out of millions of dollars was convicted Monday after jurors determined he accepted a bribe from company founder <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON>, 52, was convicted of one count of conspiracy _ taking a bribe to cover up <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION>'s frauds _ and four counts of mail fraud. The 22-year-old <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who was 16 when he created the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company in his parents' garage, was convicted by the same jury last week of 57 counts of fraud. Ten other defendants pleaded guilty to various charges. Jurors deliberated heard four months of testimony about the $ 25 million swindle that snared Wall Street brokerages, major banks and small investors. Before his downfall, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> gained wide publicity as an apparent boy genius in business. Convicting young <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> `` was n't something that was easy,'' said jury foreman <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiedemann </PERSON>, 32, after the trial ended. `` I had to separate my emotions from my decision.'' He noted that <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> was `` just a kid'' and said, `` I wanted to let him go. But I felt in my bones the guy was guilty.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a federal grand jury and the Police Department remained involved Monday in investigations centered on the <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> case. Last year, Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> described ZZZZ Best as one of several local companies linked to money laundering and drug trafficking by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> crime families. Police Department spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said the 17-month-old statements are `` still valid and the investigation is continuing.'' Federal prosecutors say their work on the case now involves the more complex securities fraud side, exploring such issues as whether insider information was illegally used to profit from trading in ZZZZ Best stock. During the trial, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> claimed that he was exploited by mobsters who infiltrated his business. Sentencing for <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> was set for February, and sentencing for <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> was set for March. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> told a friend at the <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> accounting firm that something was amiss at ZZZZ Best. Later, he accepted $ 25,000 from <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> to retract that statement, prosecutors said.

 The head of a polygamist clan `` declared war'' on the outside world when he began the confrontation that ended in the death of a law officer, a prosecutor said Monday as the case went to the jury. A jury retired for the evening after starting deliberations in the trial of three clan members charged with second-degree murder in the death of <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, killed Jan. 28 during a shootout that climaxed a 13-day standoff. In closing arguments, prosecutor <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> told state district court jurors that clan patriarch <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27; his brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21; and brother-in-law, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 22, deliberately chose a course of confrontation that led to bloodshed. House was killed and <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> seriously wounded when the shootout ended the police standoff at the clan's <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> farm. The standoff began Jan. 16, when <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> bombed a Mormon chapel. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> `` basically declared war on the church, state and nation'' when he bombed the chapel, <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> contended he was divinely inspired to commit the bombing, but <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> dismissed the clan leader's claims. `` God did n't place those weapons in their hands. He did n't place them around the house, he did n't load them, he did n't take the safeties off, he did n't put his finger on the trigger and he did n't fire,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, countered that just because clan members were well-armed did not mean they intended to use their weapons. Singer has acknowleged firing the fatal bullet from his bedroom window, but he maintains he was firing at the police dogs that House was directing, not at the officer himself. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s other lawyer, said his client has a `` deeply held religious belief in the sanctity of human life'' and cried, `` Oh, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>, why did you do it?'' after singer fired the shot. But prosecutor <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON> said Singer and the Swapp brothers had willfully and knowingly prolonged the confrontation and could have accepted a peaceful compromise at any time during the siege. The confrontation at the farm began after Singer and the Swapp brothers bombed a nearby Mormon chapel on Jan. 16, the ninth anniversary of the death of Singer's father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON>, says her husband's death was the result of a conspiracy between state authorities and church officials angry at his open practice of polygamy and refusal to send his children to public schools. The Mormon church officially abandoned polygamy in 1890.

<HEAD>More Parties To Contest 1990 Elections Under New Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A law allowing political parties will be adopted before parliamentary elections in 1990, but until then no new parties will be permitted in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a junior minister said Monday. <PERSON> Geza </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON>, the deputy justice minister, told reporters an 11-member constitutional court will be set up next year and will be the only state organ competent to rule whether a political party is constitutional or not. Parliament begins a winter session Tuesday that reportedly could extend beyond the Christmas holidays _ extremely unusual in a communist country. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s parliament has grown increasingly lively this year, with many deputies questioning the legislature's traditional rubber-stamp role. Government spokesman <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marosan </PERSON> said parliament's 15-point agenda includes the 1989 budget and long-awaited laws on assembly and association that will recognize, in principle, the right of citizens to form political parties. <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> said the law may not be considered until January because of the large agenda. It is part of the government's `` package plan for democracy,'' including laws for a new constitution, presented to parliament last month by Minister of State <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a leading reformer. The law on associations was `` a step forward,'' <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> said, that is needed to clear up `` legal uncertainties'' plaguing the government and dozens of independent interest groups, associations and trade unions that have mushroomed this year. Although these groups are legal, as their establishment does not run counter to the constitution, there are no laws defining how an organization can be established, what body is empowered to register it or who is to exercise control over its operation, he said. A separate law would regulate the actual establishment, registration and legal control of political parties. Referring to objections expressed by independent groups who feel the associations laws should also apply to parties, <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> explained the party law would be directly linked to the new constitution, likely to be adopted in 1990. The new constitution will not be committed to either a single or multiparty system but also will not declare `` the leading role of any party,'' <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> said, referring to the traditional role of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Still, it would leave no doubt that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is a `` socialist society,'' he said. A first draft of the party law is to be completed by Feb. 15, <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> said, but it would not be passed before the new constitution is adopted. That is expected only by mid-1990, when elections are scheduled. Among the communist states, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> always has been comparatively tolerant of cultural freedoms and small enterprise.

Officials at the school said material from one corner of the ceiling came tumbling down. Students were struck by falling plaster and a light fixture.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on Monday to be his secretary of housing and urban development, calling the quarterback-turned-politician the `` idea man'' to lead a Republican war on poverty. Rep. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the former pro football star whose advocacy of `` supply side'' tax cuts helped shape President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies, promised to be outspoken on urban issues as part of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` I plan to be audacious in my approach to these inner-city problems of poverty and homelessness and joblessness,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman who unsuccessfully fought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called his former rival `` one of the premier architects of the opportunity society that we are trying to create.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has now named eight of his 14 Cabinet officers, was ready to add to the list on Tuesday. Congressional sources, commenting on condition they not be named, said the president-elect would announce <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mass transit official, as his transportation secretary. The sources also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was likely to name the first black member of his Cabinet on Tuesday. That could be <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a medical educator from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> who has been the front-runner for secretary of health and human services. A congressional source said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also near an announcement on another black, <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, to be secretary of veterans affairs, a new Cabinet post. <PERSON> Becton </PERSON> is a retired three-star Army general who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Transition sources said there appeared to be `` a snag'' with the <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> nomination that developed after quotations from him that appeared in Sunday editions of The Atlanta Constitution suggested he had pro-choice views on abortion. Earlier, transition officials had said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had assured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during their meeting last week that he shared the president-elect's anti-abortion views. Officials said the remarks reported on Sunday were being looked into, but they did n't know if the statements would disqualify <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> from the job. Around the country, meanwhile, 538 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and his son <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, were casting the votes Monday confirming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Nov. 8 election victory. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked if he thought he would win, replied simply, with a straight face, `` Yes.'' His selection of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> won quick praise from outside as well as inside the GOP. `` I believe he will be aggressive about supporting the housing agenda. He's not the kind of person who would accept the mission and then try and destroy it,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, a Democrat. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beals </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` an energetic activist'' who has `` showed a readiness to press aggressively for new approaches.'' Action is needed after two <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> terms, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was told in a meeting later with city, county and state officials. `` It's commonly known that housing programs have been cut up to 80 percent over the last eight years,'' <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` That's the reason ... that you'll see whole families as in our city showing up in shelters and soup lines. So that's got to be addressed.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` was listening and receiving everything we said well and really wants to help.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who has long advocated creation of urban enterprise zones to spur investment in inner cities and has proposed the sale of public housing units to tenants, should give the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> job new visibility. The current <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who has held the job since the beginning of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, worked quietly on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposals to scale back housing programs. Meanwhile, congressional officials said transition aides were searching for candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> beyond the four names backed by <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> had been mentioned. Western Republicans signaled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> several days ago they could support any of four contenders: Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Vucanovich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> oil and gas executive <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also met Monday with <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still must fill the posts of labor secretary, energy secretary, <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary, and secretary of veterans affairs. Asked about energy secretary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was leaning toward a candidate with experience in the nuclear energy field `` because of some of the problems we've been reading about'' concerning deteriorating nuclear plants and because of the `` needs to diversify our own energy base.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 53, told reporters he would not speak out publicly on foreign affairs, but expected to have a voice in the Cabinet on domestic economic issues beyond housing. `` I'm going to be a good team player,'' vowed <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who did not seek re-election to the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, district he has represented for 18 years. About a future presidential run, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said: `` I have n't ruled out seeking office some day, nor have I ruled it in.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s appointment cheered conservatives, who had seen few of their numbers win spots in the emerging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who during the winter primaries depicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a member of the establishment too wedded to government to resist raising taxes, said Monday he took <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at his word of not supporting a tax increase. `` I did read his lips,'' he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is an original sponsor of the 1981 legislation that resulted in the tax cut embraced by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ a role for which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hailed him on Monday. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is an idea man and I'm now asking him to apply his vision of opportunity to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s housing and urban development needs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he was `` thrilled'' with the appointment to what in the past has been viewed as a second-string Cabinet post, and said he would seek a public-private partnership to `` wage war on poverty.'' Answering questions on other topics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would take an intolerant view of any acts of terrorism by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has renounced such acts as the price for diplomatic discussions with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He also said he would support new initiatives on easing Third World debt, although he voiced skepticism about any plan under which banks would be asked to forgive loans. Later, in an afternoon talk to people working on his inauguration, he said that `` as we approach Christmas, I think it is important to note that there is peace on earth, certainly between the major powers.'' Pointing to the meeting he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said, `` I am not euphorically optimistic about that -LRB- U.S.-Soviet -RRB- relationship, but I see enormous opportunity.'' The vice president donated a bright red bat and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a stuffed bear to the workers' `` Toys for Tots'' drive.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Seeks Release of Malaysian Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday called on Malaysian authorities to release 16 people held without trial since mass arrests a year ago under security regulations. Malaysian laws are `` seriously inadequate'' to safeguard against arbitrary arrest, detention without trial, torture or other degrading treatment, said the 32-page report on conditions under <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s Internal Security Act. The London-based human rights organization focused on the arrest and detention of 106 people in October and November 1987, and the government's claim they had threatened national security. Four former detainees provided testimony, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said, of torture or other forms of ill-treatment, reporting that interrogators forced some detainees to strip naked, crawl on the floor, or stand in front of over-cooled air-conditioning ducts while they were subjected to humiliating verbal abuse. Others were beaten, deprived of sleep, pulled by the hair and subjected to mock sexual assaults, the organization said. The detainees included prominent politicians, trade unionists, religious and community workers and environmentalists, it said. They were held without charge or access to lawyers and in solitary confinement for 60 days, after which at least 40 were served two-year detention orders, said Amnesty. It said the government alleged in March that the detainees had exploited sensitive issues and threatened the stability and welfare of the people, but that government officials acknowledged during October meetings with its representatives that the 40 detainees had not used or advocated violence. All but 16 were released during 1988. Amnesty said it considers the 16 prisoners of conscience. The Internal Security Act empowers authorities to order preventive detention without trial for activities deemed extremely and imminently dangerous to the state and the public, while failing to give clear criteria for identifying such activities, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the authorities had failed to distinguish between violent activities that threaten national security and non-violent activities that do not involve such a threat. The organization added that the courts uphold detention orders solely on the basis of officials' assertions that they have such grounds. Amnesty listed what it called pressing reasons for review of the security act to ensure fundamental civil liberties granted by the <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> constitution. It also urged the government to take immediate steps to prevent torture and ill-treatment.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Alleges Neglect by Police Who Waited Outside As Girl Was
Raped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman whose 12-year-old daughter was raped in her home as police waited outside for nearly half an hour filed a lawsuit Monday against the officers and the cities that employ them, a lawyer said. The lawsuit, which also names the man charged in the attack, claims that the officials were `` intentional and reckless and callously indifferent to the rights of the family'' when they did not act to save the girl and her brother from attack, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, an attorney for the family. On Dec. 20, 1987, police waited outside the family's <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment before rescuing the girl, even though her mother had escaped and was begging police to go inside, the lawsuit states. The woman's 10-year-old son was also inside, and was `` slapped around'' by the intruder, who repeatedly raped the girl, <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. The civil lawsuit asks for an unspecified amount in damages, naming only the minimum amount of $ 15,000, he said. Named as defendants are the suburb of <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, former city policeman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Horka </PERSON>, who was fired over the incident; and patrolmen <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Surufka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, who each served suspensions. Also named are the village of <LOCATION> Burnham </LOCATION> and a village officer who was at the scene, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Giglio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Horka </PERSON> said later he was waiting for the landlord to arrive with a key, rather than kicking down the door, because he feared that the girl would be in worse danger if police forced their way in during the attack. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobak </PERSON>, attorney for <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he had not seen the lawsuit, but said the city will `` defend the appropriate parties in due course.'' The current and former police officers had unlisted telephone numbers and could not be reached. <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief J.D. <PERSON> Crull </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Giglio </PERSON> could not comment on the pending litigation. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, the man accused in the attack, is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 17.

 Leftist guerrillas proposed a Christmas season truce Monday in the civil war they have fought for nine years against the U.S.-backed government. The head of the joint chiefs of staff, <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, told reporters the armed forces did not favor a cease-fire but would abide by the civilian government's decision. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s administration made no immediate response to the rebels' proposal for a cease-fire beginning Friday and ending Jan. 2. In 1985, the civilian government said it would consider a truce, but the armed forces high command rejected it and fighting continued through the holidays. There was no Christmas truce last year or in 1986. In a broadcast Monday on clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, the rebels called on <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s armed forces to suspend all land, sea and air operations and to restrict to barracks those troops not on leave. The rebels also offered to cease their offensive action. They said if the armed forces agrees to a truce, delegations from both sides should meet Wednesday or Thursday to work out details. If the armed forces does not reply by Wednesday night or rejects the overture, the rebels will continue fighting, the broadcast said.

 Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> put aside the affairs of state for some sightseeing Tuesday, a day after talks with Chinese leaders on a border dispute and other issues that have divided the world's two most populous nations. No breakthroughs were reported on the border issue, which led to war in 1962. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also discussed <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, trade and the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict in the Monday talks which his official spokesman described as `` warm, cordial and very friendly.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> met most of Monday following <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s arrival from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> for a five-day visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON>, were later treated to a state banquet at which <PERSON> Li </PERSON> acted as host. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, was the last Indian leader to travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, going to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1954. Chinese and Indian leaders last met in 1960, when then-Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> toured the Temple of Heaven, a 15th century structure where <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s emperors once prayed for good harvests and performed sacrificial rituals. In the afternoon, he was to travel 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the capital, to the Badaling section of the Great Wall. The 3,720-mile-long barrier was built over 2,000 years to keep out invaders from the north. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s only scheduled meeting Tuesday was with 81-year-old President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, a former senior army leader who took over the largely ceremonial state post last April. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> is to meet 84-year-old senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are expected to sign agreements on civil aviation, border trade and science and technology. Consular offices in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> may also be established. In comments throughout Monday, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said Chinese-Indian relations should follow a two-track policy of solving the border dispute and improving other areas of their relationship. `` It is now time to look beyond the past,'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said at the banquet. `` It is now time to look forward to the future. It is now time to restore the relationship between our two countries.'' The pronouncements appeared to signal a change in Indian policy, bringing it more in line with that of the Chinese. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said in the past it would improve Indian-Chinese ties only after progress was made on the border. Western diplomats said last week that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s political worries and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s external problems could have sparked the change. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is improving its relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and maintains strong relations with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s traditional enemy on its northeastern border. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s strong international position may have convinced <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity. At home, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> faces an election year next year in which victory is by no means assured. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also praised <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s position on the restive region of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> recognizes as part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Indian spokesman also said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> discussed <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but he refused to elaborate. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> recognizes the current government of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which was installed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government invaded the country in December 1978. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance groups. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognize Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> soon after <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s 1949 revolution. In the early 1960s, relations deteriorated over the border question and political disagreements. The border remains heavily guarded despite eight rounds of Indian-Chinese talks on the question since 1981, the last of which took place in November 1987. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should return 15,200 square miles of territory it took in the 1962 war.

 Two residents of a hotel who were unaccounted for after fire swept through the building contacted police Monday and said they were not home when the blaze broke out. Fire swept through the Morningside Hotel on Sunday, killing one person and seriously injuring two others. Officials at first expressed fears that the death toll would be higher, but gradually the number of unaccounted-for residents dropped. The 105-room, four-story hotel, built in 1924, provided cheap housing for transients and some long-term residents, many of whom depend on Social Security or other limited income, authorities said. Fire Chief <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the fire was apparently started by a discarded match in a third-floor apartment. <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and her 2-year-old son, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, were among the 120 residents forced out of the building Sunday. `` I lost everything _ dishes, clothes, a TV,'' she said. `` I do n't think we'll have much of a Christmas now.

<HEAD>UNICEF Says African, Latin Debt Threatens 10 Years of Progress for
Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 650,000 children died needlessly last year partly as a result of the economic crisis in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said in its annual report. Crushing debt has forced many developing nations to cut social spending, overshadowing the progress most nations made in the last decade in fostering better health and education for children and their parents, said <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> in his annual report, `` The State of the World's Children.'' `` By far the heaviest consequences are being borne by children,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. `` Throughout most of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and much of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, average incomes have fallen by 10-25 percent in the 1980s,'' he said. `` In the 37 poorest nations, spending per head on health has been reduced by 50 percent, and on education by 25 percent, over the last few years,'' he added. `` In many of the countries for which figures are available, child malnutrition is on the increase,'' the report says. Ten deeply indebted Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations and six in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have experienced a slowing down in the reduction of mortality in children under age 5 in 1980-87, compared with results in 1970-80. The nations are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewett </PERSON>, the deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>'s information division. `` For these 16 countries alone, the number of child deaths in the last 12 months is approximately 650,000 more than would have been the case if the 1970-80 rate of decline in under-five mortality had continued,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. `` The majority of these deaths -LRB- approximately 400,000 in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the remainder in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -RRB- could therefore be said to be related to the slowing down or reversal of the development process during the 1980s, which is a result of unprecedented borrowing, rising interest rates, falling commodity prices, inadequate investment of borrowed funds, and the demoestic and international management of the resulting debt crisis,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> did not include nations convulsed by war or civil strife, such as <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, in order to limit his estimate of 650,000 annual deaths to strictly economic problems. The <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> report notes `` the developing world is now transferring $ 20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it receives in new aid and loans.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> joins the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Conference on Trade and Development in calling for an economic `` Marshall Plan,'' providing more development aid to the developing world and writing off the debts of some of the most deeply indebted nations. The impact of the economic crisis tends to cloud the achievements of governments and <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, which are saving the lives of at least 2.5 million children yearly, the report says. Vaccines are now saving the lives of about 1.5 million children each year in the developing world, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> notes. At the beginning of the 1980s, less than 5 percent of the Third World's children were immunized, and diseases such as whooping cough, measles and tetanus killed up to 5 million children annually, his report says. Now more than half the developing world's children are immunized, and many nations are approaching <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of 85 percent immunization by 1990. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with one-sixth of the world's children, is believed to have just achieved 85 percent immunization; <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, home of 20 percent of the world's infants, is now past the 60 percent mark, the report says. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> have almost reached the 85 percent immunization target, and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> are on track to reach 80-90 percent coverage by 1990, it says. A new goal is the immunization of pregnant women against tetanus, which extends protection to their newborns, said the report. Only 25 percent of pregnant woman are now immunized, and tetanus kills over 800,000 infants yearly. In 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> launched a campaign to reduce the death rate from dehydration caused by diarrhea, then claiming 4 million children annually. By promoting the use of inexpensive Oral Rehydration Salts, a simple method for preventing almost all dehydration deaths, 112 nations now are saving the lives of 750,000 to 1 million children annually, the report says. An expanded education campaign is now needed to teach more parents in developing nations about the technique, the report says. Currently one-fourth of afflicted children receive rehydration therapy, and 60 percent of the world's children under age 5 have access to a source of Oral Rehydration Therapy.

<HEAD>Consumer Reports Calls Viralizer Ineffective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cold sufferers will get more relief from chicken soup than from a heavily advertized gadget that blows hot air or a fine spray of medication into the nasal passages, according to Consumer Reports. The Viralizer is being marketed in full-page newspaper advertisements as `` the hottest thing in cold and allergy treatments.'' But Consumer Reports charged in its January issue that the device does not relieve cold symptoms and may be harmful to delicate nasal tissues, which it said could be dried out and damaged by excessive heat from the machine. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauser </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Viral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, which manufactures the device, countered: `` The only thing in the story that's true is that they quote the ad properly where we say it's the most effective relief you will ever receive or your money back.'' `` Other than that, it was malicious, defamatory and inaccurate,'' <PERSON> Krauser </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. He cited a study by the <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that `` strongly suggests'' the Viralizer relieves headaches, runny noses and congestion and helps prevent ear infections stemming from colds. But Consumer Reports said the study, which was paid for by Viral Systems, tested the device on only 22 people and would not merit publication in a medical journal. <PERSON> Krauser </PERSON> said the study used 37 people and confirmed earlier studies involving more than 150 people. Consumer Reports also cited a June letter from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> charging Viral Response Systems with making claims that were `` false and misleading or otherwise contrary to fact.'' <PERSON> Krauser </PERSON> said those charges referred to claims made for the medication in the spray used in the Viralizer, and said labeling and packaging for the product was changed in response to the complaint. <PERSON> Krauser </PERSON> said the Viralizer, which sells for about $ 35, has been sold since January 1987 and that the company's 1988 sales will be about $ 2.5 million. He said 70,000 Viralizers were sold in 1987, and of 2,000 consumer response cards returned to the company, 250 were from customers who said they were not helped by the device. Refunds were offered to all 250 customers, and 89 of them accepted the offer, he said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> successfully launched a new model space exploration rocket from a recently opened space center on southern <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday.

But it said the launch marked the first time Chinese scientists gained direct access to mid-layer atmospheric data in a low-latitude equatorial area. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has three other launch sites, all in medium latitudes. The <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> base was designed specifically for research into space physical phenomena at low latitudes, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said in an earlier report.

 Premier <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> tried his hand on Tuesday at coaxing the Soviet foreign minister into some movement on a longstanding territorial dispute that blocks accord on a peace treaty, a Foreign Ministry official said. Earlier, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the first time indicated a willingness to upgrade economic ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> despite the impasse. Rival claims over the tiny <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Hokkaido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has kept <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> from signing a treaty to formally end World War II hostilities. This has stalled Soviet-Japanese relations and hampered economic cooperation between the two countries. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, heading into a second day of talks with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and other officials, met with <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> on Tuesday to deliver a letter from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> failed to iron out disagreements on the dispute during about 6 -LCB- hours of talks. The ministry official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, quoted <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that resolution of the land dispute `` would be the basis for permanent and stable relations.'' The premier `` hoped the Soviet side would give serious consideration to the issue,'' he quoted <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as saying. The official said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, without proposing a specific date, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has put a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on his political schedule and that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was welcome to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet and Japanese officials labored on an agreement that might boost economic ties despite the row over the Kurils, which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has held since the end of World War II and which <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> wants back. The Soviets ousted 17,000 Japanese residents and later consolidated their occupation with 10,000 troops. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> what <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s attitude would be if the dispute is not solved, the Japanese official said, and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> replied that the problem should be tackled with eagerness. `` The Soviets have shown no basic change in their position'' on what <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> calls the Northern Territories, the official said. But he saw hope in the continued meetings of the two foreign ministers and their aides on the issue. Until now, Japanese officials said they expected no progress in bilateral relations until the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> agreed to negotiate the return of the islands. But in his Monday meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said: `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is prepared to develop ... economic relations'' with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a country he desribed as having `` great potential,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official reported. Trade between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been hindered by sensitivity over the territorial dispute and by national security concerns. Two-way trade reached $ 4.9 billion in 1987 _ about 1.8 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade _ and is expected to hit $ 4.98 billion this year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has ambitious plans to develop the vast Siberian region, a feat that would require input from foreign investors, including the Japanese. Before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s arrival, Japanese officials hinted at a possible compromise on the territorial dispute, but a senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s demand for the islands' return remains unchanged.

By at least one measure _ <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>'s projection for the year of 6 percent to 7 percent growth _ donations nationwide appear to have increased. Charities in many communities say contributions of money, clothing, toys and food are at least keeping pace with last year and should pick up this week before Christmas. But in other cities, contributions have dropped, hampered by cold weather, a shortage of bell ringers, shopping malls that banish fund-raisers from entrances, weak local economies, or even a drain on givers from campaign contributions earlier this year.

 For years, <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> has been a darling of the tabloids, as fans followed her storybook romance with <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> and watched her square off with the <ORGANIZATION> Ewings </ORGANIZATION> in `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' Now in `` Naked Gun,'' the latest production from `` Airplane'' creators <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> -LRB- `` ZAZ'' -RRB-, you can meet the `` real'' <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, a charming, alluring woman with an endearing tendency to not look where she's going. `` It's opened up a whole new world for me,'' said <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, whose clumsy character fits right into the upside down world of `` Naked Gun.'' `` If someone had told me a couple of years ago, I'd be doing ` Naked Gun' with <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> I would have thought they were crazy.'' In `` Naked Gun,'' she's first seen at the top of a winding staircase, a closeup affirming her status as one of the world's most beautiful women. She gazes down at an admiring <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> and the two are in love. She then proceeds to tumble down the stairs. `` I have go to back and see it two or three more times for things that I missed in the script. You're laughing so hard watching it, you have to go back and see it again,'' she said. It might strike movie fans as unusual to cast Presley in a slapstick role, but her lack of comedic experience was exactly what <ORGANIZATION> ZAZ </ORGANIZATION> _ as they call themselves _ was looking for. `` I loved the script and I wanted desperately to be in the film,'' she said. `` During the interview I was asked if I had ever done comedy, and I said I never had done it. I thought that was it for me.'' But as Presley learned, <ORGANIZATION> ZAZ </ORGANIZATION> wanted actors who could play off-the-wall scenes with complete seriousness. `` They said do n't play funny ` You mean like it happens everyday?' I asked. I'm always bumping into walls, right?'' `` Naked Gun,'' based on the <ORGANIZATION> ZAZ </ORGANIZATION> TV series `` Police Squad,'' stars <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> as Lt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON>, a bumbling <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officer who must prevent a corrupt businessman -LRB- <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalban </PERSON> -RRB- from assassinating <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> while she visits the city. Presley plays <PERSON> Montalban </PERSON>'s personal assistant, who falls in love with <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON> and helps foil the murder plot. `` It was hard trying to get adjusted to all this funniness,'' said the actress, who played the very serious <PERSON> Jenna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> in `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' `` In one scene, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> and I are having dinner. He's making suggestive comments and I'm licking his fingers. We must have done it about five times we were laughing so much.'' Presley, the daughter of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer, was just 14 years old when she met <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1960 and agreed to return with him to his Graceland mansion in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> were married in 1967 _ news cameras faithfully recording the event _ and the following year a daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, was born The marraige, however, could not withstand the pressures of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>' unprecedented fame and the <ORGANIZATION> Presleys </ORGANIZATION> were divorced in 1973. <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> remains protective of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>, who died in 1977. In response to the succession of books written about the late rock' n' roll star, she decided to come out with one of her own, `` Elvis and Me. `` My book showed a much more human side. It gave him more understanding,'' said <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with writer-director <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Garibaldi </PERSON> and their 1-year-old son, <PERSON> Navarone </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>. She originally sought a quiet life after her divorce, and she ran her own boutique before drifting into show business. She appeared in commercials as a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Wella </PERSON> <PERSON> Balsam </PERSON> and made her television acting debut in 1979 as co-host of `` Those Amazing Animals.'' Four years later, she auditioned for `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' for the part of <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>'s new girlfriend. She was understandably nervous; she had limited acting experience and knew little about the show. `` I only knew about ` Who shot <PERSON> J.R </PERSON>?''' she admitted. `` I did n't think I'd get the part. However, she hit it off with <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>. `` Everyone told me if I passed the test with <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> was in. I was a little bit reserved at first, I have a tendency of doing that, but he just wants to have fun. If you go in with an ego, I think <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> will run over you.'' She left `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' after five seasons and is anxious to pursue her career in movies. `` I'd love to be in the position of a Meryl Streep or <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>,'' she said. `` I'm getting good scripts, but those people are out for those parts, too. At this point, I'd take a part just for the experience; I have some dues to pay.'' And she enjoyed the opportunity to have fun at her own expense in `` Naked Gun.'' `` All we did was laugh at ourselves,'' she said. `` I did come in uptight because I did n't know what had been written about me, but this relaxed me a lot.''

<HEAD>Writer Says Chinese Communists Eroding Traditional Cultural Values</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a widely known Chinese author, says his first visit back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in four decades has left him alarmed by what he called the erosion of traditional Chinese values under communism. That was one of several shocks <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> said he received during a month-long visit to his homeland in November. But he added that he was pleased to find many people were influenced by his critical writings of Chinese society, in which he denounces authoritarianism. `` They said, ` You speak the truth and you can be the savior of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,''' he told a reporter at his hillside apartment in suburban Hsintien overlooking <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bo </PERSON>, 68, was born in <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province in eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but was among the 2 million people to flee to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with the Nationalist government that lost a civil war to <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s communist forces in 1949. His provocative writing has since led to attacks by both the Nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and communist government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. As a newspaper columnist in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> accused the Nationalists of corruption and power abuse. In 1968, he was sentenced to nine years in prison on charges of being a communist spy. Authorities in mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> permitted the publication of <PERSON> Bo </PERSON>'s works but last year temporarily banned his book `` The Ugly Chinese'' and several essay collections, claiming they insulted the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> has remained surprisingly popular on both <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the mainland even though his writings have told Chinese that their culture, a source of pride for centuries, has many shortcomings. He is known for his scathing criticism of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people as being too loud, too cruel, too selfish and too willing to tolerate the abuse of power by authorities. <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> says the Chinese have their virtues but fears they are crumpling under the communist regime. `` Under nationalization, where everything belongs to the government, people have lost many of the traditional Chinese virtues, such as modesty and politeness,'' <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> said in the interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The communist system is more feudal than the traditional -LRB- imperial -RRB- Chinese system. The Chinese communists have disrupted the good Chinese values more completely and without feeling any shame.'' The author said he was surprised that shop clerks in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> treated customers rudely and that quarrels frequently broke out on city streets. He said when people would ask him for advice he would reply: `` Chinese, please have a smile.'' <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> returned to his hometown of <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> to visit two daughters left behind in the civil war. He also traveled to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> where he met scholars, writers and students. <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> said hundreds of high school and college students showed up to speak with him when he appeared at a promotional campaign sponsored by a publishing company in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, the capital of central <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province. `` So many young people seemed to have lost their hope in the country,'' he said, stroking a pet Siamese cat curled up on his lap. `` Some even boldly asked how the communists could be driven away.'' <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> said other students traveled for hours by train and bus to visit him at <LOCATION> Hui </LOCATION>. `` They wanted to hear some frank talk,'' he said. `` They have lived too long in a closed-up society where few people speak the truth.'' <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> said he met many people, including university officials, hotel clerks and street vendors, who had read `` The Ugly Chinese,'' which was published in 1985 and portrays <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> as selfish, unconcerned about other people's rights and unwilling to face their problems. The author argues that those qualities hurt democracy and favor authoritarian regimes. The book was clandestinely passed around and photocopied in 1987 after it was banned on the mainland. `` I never knew that the book had such an impact in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. During the trip, <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> said, he collected about $ 35,000 of royalties from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> firms for his 35 books published on the mainland. But added that he had to scrap plans to set up awards for <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> poets and novelists with the money because the authorities disapproved. <PERSON> Bo </PERSON>'s most recent project, which he began in 1983 and is about two-thirds done, is translating into modern Chinese a 10th-century Sung dynasty classic that covers 1,400 years of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> history. He works 12 hours a day on it.

 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is winning the war against the dreaded disease leprosy. But that comes as little comfort to thousands of lepers who are likely to spend the rest of their days in colonies as objects of repulsion. Although contemporary medicine stresses leprosy is preventable, curable and not particularly contagious, the tell-tale patches of discolored skin cause marriage breakups; clawed fingers turn friends into strangers; the erosion of flesh means the exile of lepers to one of country's 21 colonies and leprosariums. But in these segregated worlds, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s `` poorest of the poor'' smile and press together their stubby, fingerless hands in greeting, profusely thanking outsiders for coming to visit them. They talk without embarrassment about their condition. `` Here, they are free to share their problems. They can take care of each other. And nobody looks down on them,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Banchong </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaiyara </PERSON>, a 43-year-old Roman Catholic priest who oversees projects to help some 1,500 lepers in northeastern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Banchong </PERSON> and others believe that after treatment lepers should be integrated into society. But given existing prejudices this becomes virtually impossible. In and around this provincial city are church-supported enclaves and a large, self-contained leper community, <PERSON> Non </PERSON> <PERSON> Somboon </PERSON>, run by the Thai government for 1,200 lepers and their famlies. It includes individual homes, schools, farmland, even a jail -LRB- begging `` on the outside'' appears to be the major offense -RRB-. The network of church projects, some of them inside Non <PERSON> Somboon </PERSON>, provides lifetime care. A kindergarten for children of lepers stresses personal cleanliness and a nutritious diet as bulwarks against the nerve - and skin-ravaging disease There are dormitories for those undergoing treatment and classes in shoemaking, sewing and carpentry for lepers to learn a trade and earn income. Most residents are from poor rural families. The oldest, believed to be near 100, hardly ever stirs in a bed at the Old Age Home. Her two children, both lepers, have died and nobody can remember when she first came. One of the youngest is 14-year-old <PERSON> Phitsamai </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorapha </PERSON>, who arrived several months ago crying in pain and watching the gradual clawing of her little fingers. `` The other children did n't want to talk or play with me,'' the shy girl said. `` I do n't think I will be cured,'' <PERSON> Phitsamai </PERSON> said. When asked about an occupation, marriage and other plans for the future, she replied: `` I do n't have any dreams.'' Public ignorance about the disease and the disfigurement it causes have traditionally tended to make lepers outcasts in many parts of the world. In <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, some Buddhists believe leprosy is punishment for sins committed in a previous life. Leprosy workers in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> tell of a patient who returned from treatment to find he had been registered as dead by his parents. In another case, parents hired killers to dispose of their diseased child, but the child was later found abandoned in a forest by the would-be killers. <PERSON> Banchong </PERSON> says a leper who turns out superb shoes at the church-run workshop probably could n't make it on the outside: customers would n't buy his product if they knew about his disease. Nevertheless, Sister Mercedes, one of more than a dozen <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> nuns working with <PERSON> Banchong </PERSON>, notes progress since she first arrived in 1969. She recalls hospitals turning away lepers, whom she calls `` the poorest of the poor.'' Now, she says, the government mounts impressive programs and more are seeking treatment at the early stage of the disease, when cure is relatively simple, rather than waiting in shame and secrecy as so often in the past. `` I think the end is in sight,'' she said, reflecting government statistics that show a decline in registered leprosy cases from 140,000 in 1954 to about 25,000 currently. However, the total number of lepers is conservatively estimated at more than double this figure. `` By the time they found good medicine I had already lost my fingers,'' said 70-year-old <PERSON> Naimak </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiranai </PERSON>. Now, both his legs are gone and his face is very disfigured. He moves around on a crude wheelchair. His wife had run away, he says, and his two children sold his house and fields when he left to seek treatment. Eventually, <PERSON> Naimak </PERSON>'s leprosy was medically arrested, but <PERSON> Banchong </PERSON> said he has no other home now but the colony. `` When I was a boy I broke the legs of frogs and was cruel to other animals of the field,'' <PERSON> Naimak </PERSON> said. `` Maybe that's why I became a leper.''

<TEXT>
 This long-suffering nation has embarked on a presidential campaign played out against a backdrop of surging political killing. The winner's prize in the balloting March 19 is a stalemated civil war. Each passing week lengthens the list of dead, maimed and displaced in the 9-year-old guerrilla war without providing prospects for resolution of the insurgency either through negotiations or by force. The result is a tiredness of spirit among the country's 5.5 million people, especially the two-thirds who eke out a living raising corn and beans on small plots. The main contenders for the presidency are <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> _ the resurgent right-wing group known as Arena _ and <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> of the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a U.S.-educated coffee grower and businessman, has a narrow lead, but far from a majority, in the latest reliable poll. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> trounced the flagging <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in municipal and legislative elections in March, winning an outright majority in the 60-seat unicameral legislature. One new factor is the political left, which is running candidates for the first time since the mid-1970s. Leftist leaders acknowledge they have no chance of winning, but say they hope to drum up support for negotiations. Arena, citing its own polls, says it has the election wrapped up. But <PERSON> Sigifredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, a retired army colonel, legislator and one of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s top leaders, charged recently that some sectors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> intend to `` impose'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> as president. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has provided <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with more than $ 3 billion in aid this decade, helped rig elections in 1984 and 1985 to ensure Christian Democratic victories. `` If <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> is deprived of its rightful victory, well, someone asked me if we did not win the election would we resort to nationalist guerrilla warfare. And I say a frustrated people could do just that,'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, as well as local and international human rights groups, say <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> was closely linked to death squads that killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s. Arena denies the charges. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' popularity has been drastically eroded by nearly five years of unfulfilled promises, economic stagnation and the widely held perception of official corruption. They have not been able to make any progress towards ending the war, which pits about 7,000 Marxist-led guerrillas against the 56,000-member, U.S.-backed armed forces. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer. Chemotherapy appears to have arrested its spread, and his most fervent hope is to be able to personally hand over power to his successor June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 63, contines to work. But his prestige and influence are greatly diminished. `` He is not only a lame duck, he has no power to do anything,'' said <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baro </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest and vice-rector of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. No one envisions peace negotiations with the leftist guerrillas before the next administration takes over. Three rounds of negotiations between 1984 and 1987 proved fruitless. The opposing positions have not changed significantly, and there is little besides increased war-weariness to foster hope of a breakthrough. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> says it will talk with guerrillas, but <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said that such discussions would not be negotiations. He added that <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, in power, would propose a `` national plan'' drawn up with input from outside the party. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> contends the armed forces have had their hands tied by human rights concerns and other factors. He maintains that government troops could win in about two years without restraints. But the guerrillas have been persistent and apparently have the moral and material support of many people in the countryside, the campesinos. Even <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers here say the rebels are a thoroughly motivated fighting force. The war's stalemate apparently has contributed to this year's steep rise in politically motivated killings _ summary executions by the army, death squads and the guerrillas The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Legal Aid office has counted 169 such killings _ 90 by the army, 46 by death squads and 33 by the rebels _ in the first nine months of 1988. That is a 70 percent increase over the same period in 1987. `` There is growing frustration in the armed forces,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baro </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` How are they not going to be frustrated if they've received -LRB- from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- all conceivable aid for eight years, everything they wanted and more,'' but still ca n't defeat the outnumbered and badly equipped guerrillas. The guerrillas have condemned every previous election this decade as `` a farce'' designed to further what they say is a U.S.-sponsored `` counterinsurgency project.'' Radio Venceremos, their clandestine voice, said recently, `` Organized and combative struggle is the alternative to the electoral maneuver.'' But they have not overrun a significant military post in 18 months, and army officers say the rebels are concentrating on `` soft'' targets. The officers say that indicates rebel weakness relative to a year or so ago.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, bound by a new defense agreement and headed toward creation of joint embassies, are providing some of the greatest impetus for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity. As the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> moves toward the removal of internal barriers by the end of 1992, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> have been pushing innovation in various key areas, including the economic sphere. The moves come as <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> jockeys to compete more effectively with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on world markets, and some quarters call for a reduction of the 326,000 American military personnel in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It's obvious for all Europeans that the Americans wo n't be in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> forever'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennacchioni </PERSON>, the defense attache at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, said in an interview. `` We know that we have to prepare in advance for the future. We -LRB- the French and West Germans -RRB- are showing the way that should be taken.'' He stressed, however, that West Europeans view American troops as indispensable, and the view is unlikely to change in the near future. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which have worked for decades to put the bitter experience of the two World Wars behind them, have taken these joint steps recently: _ Approved a joint defense and security council It will meet at least twice a year starting in early 1989 to coordinate virtually all aspects of defense, including disarmament, and will include the heads of government as well as the foreign and defense ministers. _ Created a joint economics council of their finance and economics ministers, as well as the central bank presidents The council will meet four times a year starting in 1989 to reach agreement on various economic issues, including inflation, currency rates as well as some foreign trade questions. _ Agreed to establish a 4,200-man joint French-German military brigade that will be fully in operation in <LOCATION> Boeblingen </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> by October 1990 It will include infantry, tanks and artillery. As a preliminary move, a joint French-West German staff of 52 soldiers already has been established in <LOCATION> Boeblingen </LOCATION>, with troops scheduled to start gathering next year. _ Made plans to open a joint embassy in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> by 1990, with another one in another country at a later date The embassies could be models for future such bilateral cooperation, possibly including joint embassies with other countries. The joint military work probably is the most ambitious project _ and the one that has raised eyebrows within the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have the impression that the other European countries have some apprehensions,'' Gen. <PERSON> Pennacchioni </PERSON> said in the interview. `` They are afraid of a French-German leadership.'' Said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweinsteiger </PERSON> of the West German <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>: `` The Americans, British and Italians reacted critically -LRB- to the joint military brigade -RRB-. The Italians reacted very critically. Perhaps that was a feeling that they were being excluded. `` Then we explained everything, and the criticism went down.'' <PERSON> Schweinsteiger </PERSON> emphasized: `` You can not view this as the first step toward an initiative that would do without an American military engagement in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The French and the Germans view the American presence as indispensable.'' The West German Greens party took exception to the bilateral defense council. A Greens member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebermann </PERSON>, charged: `` The agreement signals a step toward a German-French nuclear axis aimed at <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials also have come up with another Euro-centric defense idea, a proposal for a multinational European military division of about 15,000 troops within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a German initiative for another European effort to improve defense,'' Gen. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON>, the West German chairman of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said during a recent high-level <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. It would include forces from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. `` The proposal was taken seriously, but not everyone applauded,'' said <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Janning </PERSON>, an East-West expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mainz </ORGANIZATION>. `` The West Germans have thrown two stones into the water and they want to see which one makes the bigger ripples,'' said <PERSON> Janning </PERSON>, in reference to the joint brigade and possible European division. <PERSON> Janning </PERSON> also said he saw wide-ranging economic motives in French-West German economic cooperation. `` The French see the West Germans have the best contacts with the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. So the French see it's best to work with the Germans in that area.'' Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has called for even closer cooperation between West German and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in formulating a `` joint European policy'' toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its East European allies. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> also are developing major initiatives in diplomacy, including the possibility of joint embassy receptions. Two French diplomats already are working in the West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and two West Germans are serving in the French Foreign Ministry. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeifer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the joint French-West <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> embassy in Communist-run <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> is to be open by 1990 with plans for a second in an as yet undisclosed country. `` These integrated embassies could be a model for future cooperation with another country,'' <PERSON> Pfeifer </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Both countries are functioning as a driving force for further European cooperation.'' The various measures come as a new poll indicates a rise in respect between French and West Germans, compared with five years ago. A French-German poll conducted by the independent polling firm <ORGANIZATION> SOFRES </ORGANIZATION> said that 54 percent of the French surveyed considered <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> their best friend, while 67 percent of the West Germans interviewed felt the same about <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came in second in both countries. In a similar poll in 1983, 48 percent of the French surveyed rated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at the top of their allies list, while 53 percent of the West Germans placed <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at the top of their list.

 <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION>, the cable channel that has revived old sitcoms for prime time, is getting its own new cartoon series. But <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>'s `` Tattertown'' will fit right in _ it's about discarded objects that come to life. <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> said the concept of `` Tattertown'' began as doodling in high school. `` It's been in development for 25 years,'' <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> declared. `` It's my monster. It started in high school as a comic strip. It was an excuse to make fun of who we are by the objects we throw away. ` Tattertown' is a world where everything we once owned comes alive.'' `` Tattertown'' debuts Wednesday on <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> at Night with a Christmas special that introduces <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> and her stuffed doll Muffit. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> is the only human in a world where inanimate objects come to life. <PERSON> Muffit </PERSON> becomes the evil ruler of this magical world, while <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> struggles to bring her back to the real world. Thirty-nine additional half-hour episodes will be shown on <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION> in 1989 and 1990. `` It's nostalgic, with cartoons and stuff from the 1920s and'30s,'' said <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, who is best known for such adult animated features as `` Fritz the Cat,'' `` Heavy Traffic,'' `` Coonskin,'' `` The Lord of the Rings'' and `` American Pop.'' He also produces `` Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures'' for CBS. `` Tattertown,'' he said, `` has a kind of 1926 style to it. This is my first true-to-life thing for kids. My other cartoons were more for adults. It's my first step into <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s world of wholesome stuff for kids. Still, I think adults will like the nostalgia of it. `` It wo n't be as satiric as ` Mighty Mouse.' I think kids will see those wonderful toys running around. I think they'll get it. You ca n't talk down to them. We'll have three kinds of music. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> white-bread music, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> sophisticated jazz and hot jazz like <PERSON> Fats </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> was in his cramped studios located in what looks like an old motel in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>. Drawings were pinned all over the walls, and every inch of space was taken up with animators working on the celluloid frames. One of his directors, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, worked on `` Snow White'' for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> and on various cartoons at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> said he was approached by <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION> after he completed work on `` Mighty Mouse. About half the animation will be done at his studios and the rest overseas. `` We do more animation here than most companies,'' he said. `` We do all the key posing and timing. Besides, my motto is if you do n't have animators around who can you yell at?'' <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> grew up wanting to become another <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capp </PERSON>, creator of the newspaper comic strip `` Li' l <PERSON> Abner </PERSON>.'' At the age of 21 he became the youngest animator in the business at <LOCATION> Terrytoons </LOCATION>. He was soon promoted to director and at 24 was the studio's creative director. On the side he drew `` Fearless Fosdick'' sequences for <PERSON> Capp </PERSON>'s `` Li' l <PERSON> Abner </PERSON>. He made numerous attempts to start his own comic strip, but he was turned down by all the syndicates. `` I quit Terrytoons and started my own studio when I was about 27,'' he said. `` I did n't know what I was doing. The first thing I did was ` Fritz the Cat.''' `` Fritz'' got an `` X'' rating when it was released in 1972. It attracted a lot of attention, and <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> picked up a reputation as rebel. `` I'm just an artist who runs a studio and tries to uphold the rights of artists,'' he said. `` I'm not a rebel. I've had a lot of troubles. I just want my freedom of speech. I want to be able to express myself. I just want to do my job. ` <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON>' was a great cartoon. ` Heavy Traffic' was better.'' He leaned back in his chair. `` I'm not a rebel,'' he said. `` I've mellowed out. <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> will also produce and direct an animated special based on Dr. <PERSON> Seuss </PERSON>' `` The Butter Battle Book.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Geisel </PERSON>, who writes under the name of Dr. <PERSON> Seuss </PERSON>, is writing the script and lyrics for the songs. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who directed the Peabody Award-winning Seuss classic `` How the <ORGANIZATION> Grinch </ORGANIZATION> Stole Christmas'' will be a consultant.

<TEXT>
 Ordinarily in the story of the first Christmas, the man of the family is subordinated as a secondary figure. In actuality, he carried out an essential and decisive role. That's the anomaly of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, husband of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The generally scant attention given him is pointed out by Episcopal Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, who suggests more appreciation is in order for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s heroism. He often `` is omitted from our recollection of events'' of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>'s birth or portrayed `` unobtrusively in the background, leaning on his staff'' or leading a donkey, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> says in his Christmas message. The spotlight, meanwhile, is focused on <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and the child. Yet <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> guided and protected that family through dangers which threatened it, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> says, noting that it was no easy, placid affair, but one beset with troubles. The burdens laid on <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> began when he learned to his painful dismay that the young woman to whom he was betrothed, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, had become pregnant by someone else. Being a just, law-abiding Jew, yet not wanting to `` put her to shame'' by openly renouncing her, the account says, he broken-heartedly `` resolved to divorce her quietly.'' Distraught and sorrowing, he then had a strange dream in which an angel reassured him that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> was pregnant by the Holy Spirit and would bear a special son who would save people from sin. Wild or imagined, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> seized it as real and sure, claiming <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> as his bride. When ordered to <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> for a tax registration, he took her with him, though it was n't required, possibly to shield her from <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION> gossip. After they had traveled the 90 miles of dusty road and nightly camps, with her in the late stages of pregnancy, they found the town jammed, with no room in the inn. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> finally found a sheltering livestock cavern, and there he helped <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> to a pallet of straw and cared for her as the child was born. Later, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> had another strange dream _ and he again acted on it for the sake of that child. The dream was that the king had ordered the child killed. `` Rise,'' the angelic voice warned, `` take the child and his mother, and flee to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and remain there till I tell you; for <PERSON> Herod </PERSON> is about to search for the child to destroy him.'' In the middle of the night, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> roused his wife, and hastily assembling essential gear, they left with the child, heading south toward <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. For many months, they were refugees, sleeping wherever they could, surviving on what he could earn on work gangs or otherwise. But he somehow provided for his family. Eventually, through another dream, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> decided they could safely return and they did so, making that long trip back to <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>. There, as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> reached boyhood, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> took over teaching him _ prayers, blessings, Scripture and the carpentry trade. When a lad of l2, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> showed an independent streak, getting absorbed in conversing with <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> scholars in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, while his parents hunted him for three days before finding him. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the `` patient carpenter,'' was `` ever God's obedient servant,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> says, responding to each crisis to protect and shield <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and the child. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> adds: `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> was called by God to do what was socially unacceptable in taking a pregnant <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> into his house; he was unable to find a suitable place for her to give birth. `` He led his family into exile; he had to begin a new life. ... <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> is an important part of our understanding of the incarnation because he helps remind us that God entered into the very core of humanity. `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> reminds us that God often calls the most lowly and the most unlikely to be instruments of salvation. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> reminds us that our relationships may not always be trouble-free or happy, but they can be holy.''

 Christmas services provide an opportunity to draw alienated Catholics back into regular worship, but priests tend to `` ridicule and demean'' them for attending so infrequently, says the Rev. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON>. Writing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholic, published by the Claretian Fathers, the noted priest-sociologist-novelist says: `` One of the more twisted and sick kinks in clerical culture is the propensity to ridicule and demean the ` Christmas Catholics' and, even when priests are on their best behavior, to patronize them.'' <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON> says `` Christmas Catholics,'' who show up only on such holidays, often are alienated from the church, having been hurt or confused by it, and they `` need to know there's room for them in the inn, too.''

<TEXT>
 On a day when it should have been detecting drug smugglers, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 20 million flying radar platform was towed to its hangar for repairs. The radar dome atop the four-engine P3 <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> had stopped spinning in flight for the third time in a week this month. Radar specialists inside could n't produce those snazzy color-coded displays on their computer screens, designating friendly and suspect planes more than 200 miles away. As the plane inched down the flight line to Customs' spanking new $ 4.5 million hangar, the agency's war against airborne and seagoing drug smugglers also slowed down. For the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> air branch generally, and the surveillance unit based here on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, this can be the best and worst of times. Less than a decade ago, Customs fliers felt like World War I aviators, bouncing around in light single-engine planes, using binoculars to spot the enemy. But Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., wanted a real Customs air force, and while many federal agencies retrenched, the air interdiction program shot up like an adolescent There are 88 Customs airplanes now, including detection aircraft, trackers, interceptors and helicopters carrying officers ready to swoop down and make an arrest. The program that employed 153 people in 1981 and cost $ 27.3 million now has a $ 165 million budget and 811 employees. But expansion has brought severe growing pains as equipment has broken down, sometimes because it is too old and sometimes because it is too new. Failures have plagued all seven airplanes here at <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, where the mission is the weakest link in stopping drug smuggling _ detecting smugglers' planes and boats and sorting them from the pack. `` We're looking for one little guy among hundreds,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, an air branch chief and pilot in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. `` We've caught most of the idiots Now we're up against the smart ones. They do have the edge now, but it's a start.'' At the top of the detection pyramid is the new P3 airborne early warning flying radar platform. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, which designed the plane for anti-submarine warfare and detection, modified it to include the 24-foot spinning radar dome atop the fuselage. Tied to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> radar used by the military, the plane has capabilities similar to an Air Force Airborne Warning and Control -LRB- AWACS -RRB- aircraft. The P3 has done well when working, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, and in one crucial test near <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, it spotted virtually all aircraft taking off from a known drug-producing region. But during a week-long visit by a reporter, the dome would stop spinning when the plane's speed reached 200 knots, and it had to be taken out of service while uneasy <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> experts tried to find the problem. `` They want to do dog and pony shows, but the bugs are not worked out yet,'' said one Customs air crewman, who insisted on anonymity. `` They shoved it out of the factory too quick.'' Added another crewman, `` It was a political move. Instead of working out all the bugs, they put it on the market.'' The early warning radar is n't the only problem plaguing the surveillance unit. Crewmen said the main radar in four P3s used for detection and long-range tracking of smugglers has failed often, an event witnessed by a reporter. The radar was built for an F-15 `` air superiority'' plane, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet that stays in the air an average of one hour and 20 minutes. But during P3 flights of six and even 12 hours, the radar's guidance system goes haywire, giving operators false readings of planes and boats traveling 800 miles an hour Customs crews said that in an intense 10-day mission in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> earlier this year, the guidance system on one P3 was not functioning about three-quarters of the time, even though the equipment was replaced twice during the operation. A reporter also witnessed the radar fail in one of Customs' two twin-engine E2C Hawkeyes, a surveillance plane built for aircraft carrier duty in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. A dome radar aircraft with limited range, the Customs E2C experienced a failure of its detector processor, the radar's computer that tracks other airplanes The two Hawkeyes given to Customs by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> have had so many carrier landings they are `` ready for the boneyard,'' according to one crewman who flies in them often. These failures are significant, because Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> estimated that only 5 percent of the drug smuggling planes flying over the southwestern border from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are apprehended. Detection also is poor in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, but it is near 25 percent south of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> predicted that when Customs can apprehend one-quarter of the smuggler aircraft, drug pilots will think twice about the risk. That has happened near <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; many smugglers changed tactics, dropping their loads to small boats rather than fly near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. When all the equipment is working, the surveillance planes here fly only about 12 hours a day, giving smugglers a free ride half the time. Despite such problems, Customs officials, crewmen and lawmakers believe the air detection system will be an effective weapon when it's finally in place _ perhaps by 1991. Customs is scheduled to receive another airborne early warning P3 next April and has proposed an eventual fleet of four.

 The airplanes will be supplemented by a system of tethered radar balloons in the southeast, the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and all along the southwestern border. Called aerostats, the balloons fly 10,000 feet above the surface and provide coverage at lower altitudes, where drug smugglers usually fly. Only four of 17 planned aerostats are now operational. Funds have so far been approved for only eight more. `` Once we reach 1991, if we have the aerostats in place and receive the kind of support we anticipate from the military, we will have a very effective shield,'' said English. `` That's not to say this will be the answer to the war on drugs. This does not mean drugs wo n't come in, but it will be far more expensive, dangerous and difficult.'' Once the aerostat radar `` shield'' is operating from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the P3 flying detection platforms will come into their own. These aircraft can see 360 degrees around and 200 miles away. Radar specialists at two computer terminals inside can bring up displays by simply touching their screens. As airplanes appear as small squares, the operator assesses their speed, altitude, course and other data and assigns them colors: green for friendly, yellow for unknown and red for hostile. The surveillance branch in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> says 75 arrests resulted from its detection program from July last year through September of 1988. The single P3 <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION> has operated only since July, and 15 of the arrests have been made since then. In the 14-month period, 30 land vehicles or boats and 17 airplanes were seized, and five of the aircraft were taken since the P3 detection platform has been flying. The entire air branch reported 438 arrests in fiscal 1988, up from 250 in 1987 and 167 in 1986. Also in fiscal 1988, 71 airplanes, 176 vehicles and 22 boats were seized. The P3 detection platforms will eventually fly mostly `` defense in depth'' missions, according to Customs officials. A concept already tested at least four times successfully, Customs aircraft would fly long hours off the coast of producer countries such as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and observe virtually every air departure from a known drug region. This would make it far easier to sort suspicious from legitimate aircraft, one of the most difficult jobs now facing the surveillance unit. In the first such endurance test off <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the detection rate was regarded as phenomenal, and the deterrent was so strong that smugglers stopped flying once they realized something was amiss. `` The best hunting I've had,'' one radar operator said of the three <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and one <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> aircraft that flew in shifts for 16 hours a day. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, the surveillance unit air branch chief, said that without such operations, the surveillance unit is reduced to playing `` a chess game'' in the air. `` It's really hard to be in the right place at the right time,'' said radar operator <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Benham </PERSON>, as he scanned the skies on his radar scope in one of the four P3 trackers without the sophisticated dome. Instead of chasing airborne suspects, <PERSON> Benham </PERSON> was trying to take over the dome plane's detection job, which he likened to `` flying around with a flashlight.'' Customs can count on little help from countries south of the border. Only two countries provide timely assistance, according to aircrews: the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which will launch a military aircraft on request, and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, which places officers on U.S.-flown helicopters. Crewmen said it is difficult to gain cooperation from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Calls for assistance in chasing boats and planes have to be routed through the federal government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and the process can take four hours. In that time, smugglers often dump their loads or land south of the border.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The future is, for better or worse, unknowable, but that's never prevented enthusiastic prophets, soothsayers and prognosticators from trying to divine its shape _ particularly when a new year arrives that's only a short jump from a new millennium. Here's a report on forecasts offered now and in the past, some odd, some ominous, some benign, and all of them engrossing.

 Think of the years as numbers changing in a speedometer and we can begin the countdown now. Yesterday, the last day of 1988, flipped over to 1989 today and the last march of the nines began. Next year, a nine will move over, be replaced by a zero and the total will read 1990. And before we know it, in the steadily rising speed of subjective time, there will be three nines and then the days will roll up and out and the weeks will roll up and out and the months will roll up and out and finally, in a single moment of breathless magic, a zero will come up for the year, another zero for the decade, a third zero for the century and, with one to carry, to be carried oh so carefully, we will have a whole new millennium in the life of humankind. There, in the big roll of nines and zeros, will come the ultimate for lovers of symmetrical milestones: the first day of a new year, a new decade, a new century, a new millennium. It is a calendar combination prophets and prognosticators ca n't resist. They are already busy. In their latest crystal balls, they see a century in which the deaf will hear and the lame will walk; most Americans will be descended from non-Europeans; more than four million new jobs will have to be found for people replaced by robots that never tire, eat, get paid or join unions. They see a time when the life span will be stretched to 150 years and the divorce rate will zoom because who can look at the same husband for more than 100 years? A time when computer networks will match a liver donor in <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> with a patient in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>. When businessmen conferring by television continents apart will be able to see each other, talk, sell, argue, exchange contracts and baby pictures. When cars will be fully computerized and, after centuries of frustration by horse, camel and raft, a man finally will be able to answer the eternal question, `` Daddy, when will we be there?'' A time of scary scientific discovery, especially in genetic engineering, when society will have to deal with the questions of whether man is ready to play <PERSON> God </PERSON> and is God ready to let him. Who will prevail among the soothsayers, the prophets of a bright new world or the seers of doom and gloom? In that trade, history indicates that the optimists and the pessimists run about neck-and-neck. So far, the meek have not inherited the earth. But neither has Big Brother. The year 1984 came and went without `` 1984,'' the grim scenario of an ultra-totalitarian state by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>. Freedom stirs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sits in <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The world has not exploded in a nuclear Armageddon, and the planet is alive, if not well. The 20th century has improved the health of humans more than all the previous centuries combined, but it has not been kind to the planet. Unlike all the centuries that passed before, the 21st will inherit tons of man-made nuclear wastes which will remain dangerously radioactive for 280,000 years. A hundred years ago, the prophets were predicting that technology would cure most of society's ills. Now they're wondering how society will survive technology. In the hot summer of 1988, the experts warned that a severe `` greenhouse effect'' may be awaiting us in the next century, that carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere from the vast burning of oil and coal below could heat the earth, melt glaciers, raise sea levels, parch the middle of the globe and produce bumper crops in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. In the same hot summer of 1988, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told us in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that their two governments and others would try to plan cooperatively for changes in climate. Could it come to pass that the Cold War may one day end because the superpowers will fear the changing earth more than each other? No area of human prophecy has produced worse batting averages than the question of war or peace. The most recent to step up to the plate was <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Unveiling the new stealth bomber, he predicted, `` We are ushering in a new age of strategic deterrence.'' About 200 years ago, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> thought that submarines, when invented, would prove so devastating they would prevent wars. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, in 1842, predicted balloons would end war. So, by turn, would the machine gun, the tank, the airplane and the atom bomb. Humans will live very differently but human nature is likely to remain, as it has since the cave man, unchanged and `` unevolving,'' notes <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, editor of The Futurist Magazine. `` Human ability to solve problems has improved but human ingenuity will continue to embrace both the constructive and destructive.''

 <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> and others preoccupied with the future think that small wars are more likely than big wars in the next century. They think that terrorists from the countless ranks of the have-nots are more apt to create world tension than the major powers; that hunger is more likely to bring war than ideology. For most other people, bursting technology will provide a new world in the new century. According to <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cetron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Diebold </PERSON>, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> and other diviners of the future in fact and fiction, we may expect ... Homes and places of work will be computerized, robotized and, if we're not careful, completely homogenized. Automated housekeepers will heat, cool, ventilate, dust, vacuum, wash and take out the garbage at the press of a button or voice command. Mood makers will provide music, wind noises, thunder cracks and filmed images on the wall of a crackling fire, falling snow or pelting rain. Appliances will hear and, unless choked, talk. At the moment, though, in this century, talking machines are not selling. Buyer resistance. `` My husband talks back to me,'' said one shopper. `` My kids talk back to me. I do n't want my dryer talking back to me.'' Designers, however, are not giving up. They think the next generation of consumers, now growing up with talking computers in school, will be less intimidated by babbling machines. With small high-speed computers for brains, with TV cameras for eyes, hydraulic manipulators for arms and grippers for hands, robots will take over much of the heavy, dangerous or dull work now performed by men and women. They already hobnob with radioactive reactors, visit the bottoms of deep mine shafts, explore ocean bottoms and defuse explosives. <PERSON> Homo </PERSON> mechanicus also paints, welds, grinds, mills, cuts, runs a lathe and drill press, works on appliances, autos and planes without a coffee break, says <PERSON> Cetron </PERSON>. A robot now in the works will be able to return wrenches scattered on a workbench to a rack on the wall. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now leads the world in the production of robots. One of the latest from <LOCATION> Nippon </LOCATION> is called <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. lt picks up a hospital patient, places him or her in the bathtub and then returns him-her to bed freshly bathed. It is hard to picture more national change than our century produced. Nations rose and fell, disappeared and reappeared. Empires and ideologies spread and shrank. But change there will be. By 2100, the population of the world is expected to double from 4.9 billion to 10.4 billion. The poorest nations will have the most people, in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the richest will have a hard time enjoying their dinner. The developed countries will drop from a quarter to a seventh share of the world population. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will drop from fourth to seventh in population rank, behind <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of something called the gross world product will drop from 22 percent to 10 percent but, at that, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will have the largest slices. Following cheaper labor, not the sun, the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> shirt-maker, who took business away from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, will lose it to the Mexicans and Thais, who will then lose it to the Bangladeshi and Egyptians. So says <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cetron </PERSON>. Economically, the center of gravity of `` Western civilization'' will shift from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade with <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will double that with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Stripped of empire, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s share of world commerce has already shrunk to a fraction of what it was in 1900. In the quickening march of medicine and science, we are told, the blind will see better, paraplegics will step from their wheelchairs, new drugs will dissolve blood clots, and prevent or reduce heart disease, ulcers, cholesterol buildup, hardening of the arteries, hepatitis and some forms of cancer. Human tissue `` farms'' will provide everything from single cells to lungs and hearts, and transplants will become as common as tonsillectomies. Unless stopped, gene tinkerers will slow down the aging process and make possible blond, blue-eyed babies on demand. ln that brave new world, with controlled drugs and hormonal manipulation, basketball players will be 6 inches taller and baskets will have to be raised; baseball pitchers will throw harder, batters will hit longer and outfield fences will have to be moved back, maybe as much as 100 feet.

 <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> also predicts a new kind of pit stops for tiring athletes during a game. Like mechanics swarming over a racing car, trainers will swarm over the tired performer, test his blood, inject the nutrients running low and send him back, refueled, to the fray. Humanity will travel fastest in the spaceships of the next century but there is a reasonable chance it will travel farthest by a different route, learning. Anyone with a home computer terminal may be linked through computer networks to the wisdom of the ages, to the great libraries and universities of the world. Students hemispheres apart could listen to and question a lecturer in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A ghetto high school in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> could be wired into the same gathered knowledge enriching <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>. Togetherness will be strained to its outer limits. Four generations alive at the same time in the same family will be common. Within a family, computers and cable TV will make it unneccesary to leave home to work, go to school, church, take in a movie or concert, shop, reserve an airline ticket, place an off-track bet or do any number of things together at the risk of claustrophobia or fratricide. By or in the next century, it is expected that spacecraft from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> will have visited every planet except the distant <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will build a permanent base on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>; space stations will be transmitting solar energy to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. There are also those who predict that robotized space factories could be run from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> with only occasional visits by human technicians. Others consider the ultimate solution to prison overcrowding: sentence them to jails in space. Some think there will be human migrations of religious groups seeking a war-free society and another Plymouth Rock out there. And least charming was the notion projected by the movie, `` Blade Runner,'' in which all the earth becomes a miserable ghetto after a nuclear war. The rich flee to the suburbs of space. Earth is left to the poor. So far neither American nor Soviet space ships have found any sign of life out there. Certainly not a trace of `` Ming, the Merciless'' or other sinister folks Buck Rogers and Captain Video used to battle, when we were young, with opticon scillometers and cosmic ray vibrators not yet invented. Huge audiences were invited to `` live a million could-be years over a thousand maybe worlds.'' Then and now, writers of fiction could not be discounted in the march of prophecy. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON> wrote about crossing the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in a balloon 134 years before one did; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, about an orbiting satellite 88 years before sputnik; <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Verne </PERSON>, about a man on the moon 100 years before <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. Others did less well. In 1894, an obscure socialist named <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> wrote about a utopia in which most of the people of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> lived in 40,000 cooperative skyscrapers near <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. Ultimately, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> did better as a capitalist by inventing the safety razor. Sunday supplements bulged with cities of the future _ towering buildings, bright and widely spaced, helicopters flitting between them, separate serene streets for vehicles and pedestrians, traffic moving in a majestic flow, industry sharply zoned, cities ringed by a rich greenbelt of bucolic farms and parks. Among the designs that never got off the drawing board were amphibious battleships, flying tanks and troop carriers that would tunnel through mountains; a Ford Thunderbird to be called the `` Nucleon'' and powered by a nuclear reactor in the trunk; an airliner that would carry 20 engines, six `` in reserve,'' 451 passengers, a crew of 155, including a librarian, gymnast, two maitres d', two masseuses, two wine stewards, seven musicians and nine bar stewards. H.G. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> thought World War I was the last war; <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> thought the Depression was over in 1930; <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> was told, `` no Civil War picture ever made a nickel'' and thus passed up `` Gone with the Wind''; <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considered closing the <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in 1900 because everything the country needed had already been invented. Closing out the 19th century, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the future of democracy appeared bright and, with the fall of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>, the world appeared safe from dictators. On that New Year's Day, the Times exulted on the front page. `` The Century is dead; long live the Century!'' One wonders, with awe, if a new century made one exclamation mark fit to print, what will a whole new millennium bring?

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The island of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> split from the African mainland more than 150 million years ago and went on its own evolutionary course. But the island's many animals and plants which are found no place else in the world are now threatened with extinction by the encroachment of man. As smoke continues to rise from the dwindling forests, environmental groups are digging in to do battle.

 This island off the East African coast is to today's naturalists what the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>, a study in evolution. But the island's unique and diverse plant and animal life is under grave threat as man continues to torch the forest to clear the land in what one newspaper calls a kind of `` national pyromania.'' As a result, heading off the destruction of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>'s fragile habitat has become the premier goal of many international environmental groups. After <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> split from the African mainland more than 150 million years ago, its plants and animals went on their own evolutionary course. Some became extinct, like the pygmy hippopotamus, elephant bird and giant lemurs. `` There was a tremendous explosion of different forms from very, very few ancestors,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoll </PERSON>, a zoologist who represents the World Wildlife Fund here. `` <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> lets you look at the limits of adaptability. `` You can make really nice biological comparisons. What do plants have to do, for example, to live in a desert?'' <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>'s terrain ranges from rain forests to prairie to desert. Ninety percent of the plant and animal species on the 226,658-square mile island are found nowhere else: from the lovable lemurs to hundreds of species of orchids and more than 350 species of amphibians and reptiles. There are 29 species of lemurs, primates whose name comes from the Latin word for ghosts because of their largely nocturnal habits. The closest living descendants of the common ancestor of humans, monkeys and apes, lemurs were displaced by monkeys elsewhere in the world. Here they had a chance to survive in isolation. <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>'s equivalent of the woodpecker is a lemur called an aye-aye. It detects insect larvae moving in decaying trees with its sharp ears and then uses a skinny middle finger to reach in and pull them out. The largest lemur is the indri, a black-and-white creature that weighs about 15 pounds at adulthood and can leap 20 feet from treetop to treetop. The indris, whose haunting calls are reminiscent of sounds emitted by great whales, are the main attraction for the small but growing number of tourists who visit this small reserve about 60 miles east of the capital of <LOCATION> Antananarivo </LOCATION>. A short walk through a rain forest, led by a guide, inevitably turns up a family of the indris, staring down with their Teddy Bear-like faces, bemused but not much interested in their visitors. The humans, whose slash-and-burn agricultural methods now threaten wildlife and the nation's watershed, are late arrivals, coming from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Malay Archipelago only 1,500 years ago. Fourteen species of lemurs have become extinct since humans arrived, and ecologists fear others are in danger of joining them. The island's population has more than doubled since 1950, and now exceeds 11 million. Farmers are so desperate for land they are felling trees on 70-degree slopes. Four-fifths of the island's land is barren, and its forests have been reduced by half in the past three decades. The government's agriculture department long encouraged farmers to cut trees and burn the stumps to clear the ground for cash crops. The savanna is burned to produce tender shoots for an estimated 10 million zebu cattle. `` In the West and in the East, not far from the capital, the fires continue to burn,'' says <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. `` Sometimes you see the smoke trapped right here in the city.'' The government and environmental organizations are working together now to discourage slash-and-burn land clearing, though the education process is slow. `` It's primarily a human problem,'' says Prime Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramahatra </PERSON>. `` We must teach people that the natural environment is their principal source of wealth.''

 The government has shifted course from the policies adopted in a 1975 socialist revolution and now follows the advice of Western donors on economic policy. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy economic report says no economic reforms will work in the long run `` without corrective action against <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>'s single greatest self-inflicted problem: the destruction of its environment.'' The government also has broken out of the virtual self-imposed isolation since President <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> came to power in 1975. <PERSON> Nicoll </PERSON> says the government has cooperated with environmental groups since the end of 1985. `` It is our No. 1 conservation priority,'' he says. A recent issue of the daily newspaper <PERSON> Midi </PERSON> said an average of 3.7 million acres of land was being burned each year. Midi, an independent journal, likened the the burning to `` national pyromania.'' Some peasants reportedly continue to burn the land to show their displeasure with the steady decline in the nation's economy since the revolution. Per capita income declined 24 percent between 1979 and 1983. The denuded hillsides are no match for heavy rains and occasional cyclones. Great holes are carved in the landscape by erosion. The <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> north of the island is red from the red clay soil washed out to sea. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is organizing an international effort to halt the degradation, which it estimates will cost from $ 300 million to $ 400 million over the next 15 to 20 years. Already 11 major projects aided by Western environmental groups, universities and governments are under way. They include efforts to save existing reserves and plans to create new reserves or national parks. <PERSON> Nicoll </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> WWF </ORGANIZATION> is managing projects covering 10 reserves, says efforts have to take into consideration the needs of the people who live nearby. `` The people do n't want to cut down the forest just because it's there,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> anthropologist <PERSON> Elearnor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>, who is studying the aye-aye `` They truly need the wood for firewood or for land for agriculture. Many of them understand the problems in the environment and would like to do something to help but they have to feed their children.'' <PERSON> Nicoll </PERSON> says the success of the Perinet reserve proves people can be persuaded to change. `` I was there in 1985, during my first long-term stay in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` When you'd go into the reserve you'd meet people walking along with an ax. Just about every day you'd hear the chop, chop of an ax. You never hear that now. Tourism has done that. Tourism has put that place into a sort of protected status. Nobody would dare go in there now with an ax.'' Western organizations are pushing tourism, which up to now only brings a few thousand people to the island, many of them bird watchers or naturalists. Ambassador <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, whose government is a major backer of conservation projects, says, `` I think we're on the right track but time is passing very quickly and the forests are burning fast.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ He was deformed at birth and when he was 2 his legs were amputated up to the pelvis. But <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterday </PERSON>, 15, thumbs his nose at his handicap and ignores the stares of strangers, preferring to walk on his hands rather than ride in a wheelchair.

 Fifteen-year-old <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterday </PERSON> knows the sight of a 2-foot-tall boy with half a body walking on his hands or zooming down the street on a skateboard causes heads to turn. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s been stared at for so long, friends say he gets perturbed if people fail to notice him. It's part of his cockiness, part of what has helped him to survive. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> calls it his `` style,'' a tough, spunky veneer to protect the kid inside him who has been poked, prodded, inspected and rejected all his life. He insists _ by example more than words _ that he's no different from any other teen-age boy. `` I like torn-up shirts, jean jackets with holes in them, long hair, earrings and hard-rock music _ and getting in trouble,'' he says, his straight brown hair hanging limply over the collar of his denim jacket. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> walks on long, calloused hands instead of using a wheelchair, as if to prove he can be faster and tougher than people without disabilities. He refuses to wear a prosthesis, insisting it hampers his mobility while only serving to make his appearance more acceptable to the public. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> was born Dec. 7, 1973, with mangled legs and sacral agenesis, a disease that left a gap between the upper part of his body and pelvis and legs. His backbone, incomplete at birth, was re-formed in an operation when he was 6 months old. Before he was 2, his legs were amputated up to his pelvis, reducing him to a height of about 2 feet. Despite appearances, there is little <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> ca n't do, or at least does n't think he can do. He almost purposefully ignores questions focusing on the handicap but quickly answers those generic to teen-agers. Ask him, for instance, about the two rhinestones in his left ear, and he'll proudly boast about how he pierced his ears himself. Ask him what kind of music he likes, and he'll proffer a host of rap and hard-rock groups. `` I like <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crue </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AC-DC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Def </PERSON> <PERSON> Leppard </PERSON>, Led Zeppelin ...'' and the list goes on. Ask him what he wants to be when he gets older. `` I'd like to be a music teacher, or I might be a gym teacher, or president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he says, laughing like he's being tickled. `` He switches it all the time,'' taunts his 17-year-old brother, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>. `` First he wanted to be a lawyer, then he wanted to be a doctor.'' `` I might be all these things, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> retorts. It is that spirit that inspired French-Canadian filmmaker <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> to make a movie about <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>. `` From the first moment I met him, I knew I wanted to make the film with him,'' says <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, director of the movie, `` Kid Brother,'' which premiered in November in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` I really wanted to be close to that kid and work with him. He can fool around and be childish, but he's got a very serious side to his personality. `` I think the thing that helped <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> the most is that his family never tried to overprotect him. When <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> is around I never think of things he ca n't do.'' As an example of <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s ability, the director mentions a scene in the movie in which <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> swings with amazing agility from playground monkey bars. `` <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> can do so many things I'll never be able to do in my life, and he knows it,'' <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> says. `` He's very proud of it. He wants to show the world, ` Here I am. Here's what I can do. Can you do it?''' <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> says <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, did n't object to the film as long as the family was portrayed accurately _ `` not everything in pink and beautiful.'' That's because <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s life has n't been neat and pretty. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> grew up in a second floor apartment over a storefront _ with no elevator _ in nearby <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aliquippa </LOCATION>, a rough, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> steel town shadowed by the 7-mile-long <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant. His father, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, is an unemployed maintenance worker who does odd jobs, and his mother works evenings at a geriatric convalescent center. His sister, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, 20, has n't lived at home for many years and the two are n't on speaking terms, while <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> grew up resenting <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> for not being a `` normal'' brother. In the midst of this have come a herd of reporters and photographers to document <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s life. His parents usually decline to talk to reporters. Reporters can be rude when they do n't like what they hear, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> says. During an interview in October in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> carried the torch for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paralympics </ORGANIZATION>, `` this reporter got mad and walked out when we told him we do n't go to church,'' he says. Over the years <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> has gotten accustomed to rudeness and staring. `` He knows he surprises people and he's not scared by that fact,'' <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> says. `` He tries to get the best out of it.'' Prior to the movie and publicity about <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, however, `` people would see him in the street and either cross or run away,'' the director says. `` Today they ask to kiss him or shake his hand. All of a sudden, they appreciate him. He's finally getting a lot of the love and tenderness he deserves.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ They established their organic farm four decades ago, shunning pesticides and chemical fertilizers at a time when agriculture was rushing pell-mell in the opposite direction. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> and his late wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, held to their convictions and today their chemical-free food products have found markets around the world.

 The seed of the idea was planted in 1939 when <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, a young missionary to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, met <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. It eventually grew into Walnut Acres Farm, an oasis of natural food in a fast-food world, a place frequented by people such as naturalist <PERSON> Euell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, who lived 10 miles away until he died in 1975. The organic farm, one of the oldest in the country, has blossomed into a $ 5 million-a-year business in the four decades since <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, put down roots in central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and began tending the land without pesticides or other man-made chemicals. `` You do n't see the birds that are going to steal your grain from you,'' <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> says. `` They need food, too.'' The 108-acre farm the Keenes bought in 1946 is now nearly five times that large and yields about 300 organic products that are sold worldwide. The top sellers include preservative-free peanut butter, granolas and other sugarless cereals, and freshly ground, whole-grain flours. The basic tenet at Walnut Acres, according to <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, is that `` food should be _ is _ the most important thing in life and one should be more concerned about what one eats than anything else.'' `` All joys and all outreach can only be appreciated if you're healthy and do n't have to worry about your insides and your outsides,'' adds <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, 78 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVault </PERSON>, editor and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, a magazine published by the <ORGANIZATION> Regenerative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledges Walnut Acres is a pioneer in organic farming. `` I think that in the very near future, that's going to be the conventional way of farming,'' <PERSON> DeVault </PERSON> says. `` The present chemical-intensive system we have now is not sustainable _ the economics, the environment, the health concerns, the residue ... `` People like <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> have helped pave the way for a healthier future for all of us.'' <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>'s desire to enrich the earth and its people was nourished by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, whom he met nearly 50 years ago in British-ruled <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, the Yale-educated son of a minister, had gone there the year before as a missionary. `` I said to him, ` I'm teaching mathematics in a school in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I'm here and I'm learning a lot about <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and I'm not satisfied with this work I'm doing. What would you suggest?' `` He said, ` Well, I ca n't advise you on the details. But the first thing you should do when you get back is give away everything you have.''' An inspired <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1940 with his wife, a British missionary's daughter, and taught one more year at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before quitting. The couple spent the next several years at organic farming schools that stressed the need to `` go back to the soil.'' In 1946, they borrowed $ 5,000 to buy their <LOCATION> Penns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> farm, 55 miles north of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>. They worked the land without electricity, tractors or insurance. They also refused to spray their crops and soil, a criterion in the fledgling field of organic farming. Within a few years, <ORGANIZATION> Walnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acres </ORGANIZATION>, the business, was born. `` We immediately said, ` Well, it's not right that we own this whole business and get all the profits,''' <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> says. `` So we gave the business away.'' The private, employee-owned business now encompasses 500 acres, free of synthetic chemicals and tilled by modern methods, and a full-time staff of 95. Mail-order business has grown 17 percent in the past year alone, according to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 43, <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>'s son-in-law and the company's vice president and general manager As business flourishes, so does Walnut Acres' philanthropy. About $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 in donations from customers and employees will be funneled this year into a community center in tiny <LOCATION> Penns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, built and run by <ORGANIZATION> Walnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit offshoot. Another $ 8,000 will go to a home and school for orphaned and unwanted children in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> that was `` adopted'' by the foundation 12 years ago. Last year, $ 33,500 was raised for an all-purpose building at the school in memory of <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, who died in May 1987 at age 74. The lean, robust <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> uses his `` Greetings from the Farm'' essays in Walnut Acres' bimonthly catalog to muse over farming, nature `` and the oneness of all life.'' Fifty-nine of his essays, written over the past 30 years, were released by The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pequot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in late November in a book entitled `` Fear Not To Sow Because of the Birds.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> says people are becoming more interested in diet and nutrition, in part because of Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s warnings about high cholesterol, smoking and obesity `` Going together with this has been a little bit more interest in gourmet foods, and gourmet cooks start looking for purer ingredients,'' he says. `` We're leaders in the field in letting people understand what healthy eating is and what it means,'' says his wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 43, secretary and treasurer for Walnut Acres. Although exact figures are not available, experts say organic farms account for 1 percent to 5 percent of the nation's farms. The definition of organic varies from state to state, however, and the ensuing confusion has prompted some to call for federal standards. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 defined organic farming as a production system that avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators and livestock feed additives. Organic farms rely on crop rotation, crop residues, animal manure and mechanical cultivation. `` There is a need for greater uniformity,'' says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, professor of agricultural economics at <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Vegetables, grain and other crops native to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> are grown at Walnut Acres. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, nuts, dried fruits and other non-indigenous products are furnished by organic farms elsewhere that meet Walnut Acres' standards. Chickens and Holstein cattle are raised naturally on neighboring farms, with access to the outdoors, pesticide-free feed and no growth stimulants. The meat is used for soups, stews and sauces. Walnut Acres products are sold at a store on the premises and in health food shops around the country, as well as through the mail. The items are by no means cheap. Peanut butter costs $ 3.29 a pound, for example, while a 16-ounce can of chicken gumbo soup retails for $ 2.75. <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattern </PERSON>, 57, a 29-year employee who's now marketing manager, tells workers not to pack or ship anything they would n't put in their own pantry.

 In her strapless Dior gown with a Stradivarius tucked under her chin, <PERSON> Anne-Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutter </PERSON> is the glamour girl among today's young classical violinists. The German-born musician is in the fast lane, zipping around in a Porsche 911 convertible at up to 100 mph-plus on the Autobahn, vacationing in her apartment in <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION>. A fan club always greets her in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But aside from fashion, there is a practical reason for the strapless Dior. `` I discovered the violin sounds much better on bare skin and it is not so slippery,'' she says. The 25-year-old Miss Mutter indeed is serious about her music, and she has the ear of serious musicians, such as <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, music director of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic, and <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>, cellist and music director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Miss Mutter's gifts include a consummate control of her instrument, gleaming intonation, ripe sound and an assured, nerveless stage demeanor,'' wrote Time magazine. Last spring, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutter </PERSON> made her sixth concert tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, performing with major orchestras. In December, she made her first American recital tour, playing solo in 12 cities, all of the 14 appearances sold out. In January she will marry a fellow German, <PERSON> Detlef </PERSON> <PERSON> Wunderlich </PERSON>, a lawyer. After the honeymoon, she will resume her schedule of 120 concerts a year. Miss Mutter started violin lessons at age 6. She won a national competition for 6 - to 24-year-old musicians at age 7 and the German government gave permission for her to drop out of regular school and be tutored at home in <LOCATION> Wehr </LOCATION>, near the southern tip of the Black Forest While she did play with her two older brothers and other children, most of her time was spent with the violin. `` I just loved to play the violin and I wanted to play well because I liked the sound,'' she recalls. `` So I practiced. I grew up with music as something very precious and something very pure. `` My father took care I did not have a child prodigy career. What can you decide yourself at the age of 6, 8 or 13?'' Today she has an agent in each country and her father, a newspaper publisher, coordinates them. Like most classical musicians, she wo n't divulge her income. Miss Mutter only played a few concerts a year until she started performing with <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>. After that, she says, `` I did n't have to play with bad orchestras or audition for each conductor or go through competitions.'' She had her first personal contact with <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> in 1976 at age 13 after she performed at an international music festival in <LOCATION> Lucerne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> heard about it and invited her to audition. `` I did n't want to go,'' she recalls. `` For such a genius, what could I do? I pursuaded my parents to postpone. We went on a holiday to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` In December I flew to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> with my father and teacher. Both were really nervous. I was not nervous. I understood there was not the slightest bit of hope. Because I had nothing to lose, that is why I survived this moment. She played a Bach `` Chaconne'' and afterward <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> told her, `` I will be happy to play with you next year in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>.'' Miss <PERSON> Mutter </PERSON> made her first recording at 15, with <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, playing a <ORGANIZATION> Mozart </ORGANIZATION> concerto in one take. She made four recordings in 1988 for release early in 1989, including <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s `` Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D major,'' with <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Vienna </PERSON> <PERSON> Philharmonic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Witold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutoslawksi </PERSON>'s `` Chain 2'' and `` Partita,'' the latter dedicated to her by <PERSON> Lutoslawski </PERSON>. For the past three years Miss Mutter has been playing a 1710 Lord Dunraven Strad. `` I like the sound,'' she says, `` very silvery and quick responding, very good projecting.'' Four years ago, she says with a twinkle, `` I made a very good step. My parents were against my driving a sports car, saying, ` Do n't risk your life.' I decided I will ask <PERSON> Maestro </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> in front of my father. He said it was a great idea.'' <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> helped her select and order the white 911 Porsche, with its red leather interior and black convertible top. Since 1985, Miss Mutter has played chamber music with <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> and violist <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuranna </PERSON>. `` Shortly after I made my debut in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> eight years ago, with <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> conducting, he said he wanted to return to chamber music,'' she says. `` He had stopped playing with a string trio 30 years ago. `` We've played everywhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It was a dream, to play this repertory, apart from playing it with the greatest cellist and greatest viola player. You can imagine what a lesson each concert is. Every phrase you hear from both of them pushes you forward.'' <PERSON> Krzystof </PERSON> <PERSON> Penderecki </PERSON> is composing a concerto for the Mutter-Guiranna-Rostropovich Trio. The strapless stage dresses did n't begin as a trademark, Miss Mutter says. She started needing gowns at 14, to perform with <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>. But where, at that age, would she find them? She tried bridemaid's dresses, but found that the sleeves got in the way. So she bought peasant blouses with elastic necklines so she could pull the sleeves down on her arms. `` I only was looking for comfort. My neck is short, which is perfect for violin playing without support under the instrument. `` One day I felt grown up enough to buy real dresses, not this child stuff.'' So she went to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and immediately found two dresses she liked at <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION>. `` After I discovered how comfortable it is to have dresses made for you _ everything fits _ I could n't go back to a compromise. `` After I got a taste of it, I went to Dior. I prefer Dior, much more simple. I have shoes made in different colors like the dress, always the same style.'' For her performances with the trio, Dior designers fashioned a woman's tuxedo. `` I want to look as my partners look,'' she says. `` I needed different sleeves and a lot of volume in the back of the jacket. We worked on that outfit for days. `` It's comfortable but you ca n't compare it to the liberty you have in a dress. And it's so hot.''

 It seems like such a short time ago that <PERSON> Hayley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, snub-nosed, towheaded and blue-eyed, was spreading good cheer in a half-dozen pictures for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>. Her first movie, `` Pollyanna,'' at the age of 14, brought her a special Oscar in 1960. Next came `` The Parent Trap,'' `` That Darn Cat!,'' `` The Moonspinners,'' `` Summer Magic'' and `` In Search of The Castaways.'' Even as an adult it was difficult for her to stay away from Disney. Her films appeared frequently on the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> and she got more mail than any other star. She had left the Disney studio at 19, but two years ago she returned for `` Parent Trap II'' for the Disney Channel. Now 41 and the mother of two teen-age sons attending school in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> is back on the Disney Channel. She stars as a junior high school teacher in a new comedy series, `` Good Morning, Miss Bliss.'' The show, made by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, is the first network production for a cable channel. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON>, a teacher who dedicates her life to her classroom. Yet Mills herself never had a special teacher when she was growing up. Before coming to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> she attended boarding schools in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. After that, she went to school on the movie set. `` I went to so many different schools I never had a normal education,'' she says. `` When I worked at Disney I had three hours of schooling a day. I usually did it 20 minutes here, 15 minutes there, just to collect time. I'd march off to the little red school house to listen to some incomprehensible lecture on <LOCATION> Mesopotamia </LOCATION> while they were lighting the next shot.'' Each half-hour episode of the new series focuses on the classroom, although some scenes may take place at her home. `` I only have 16 kids in my class, but I appreciate what real teachers have to cope with,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> says. `` When you do a scene over and over again in rehearsal there's no surprise left. It becomes difficult to control the kids. They also have to spend four hours a day in real school.'' Her character, she says, is `` a very inventive teacher. She's very committed to her profession She always wanted to be a teacher and she has great enthusiasm. She really relates to the kids as individuals. She's the kind of teacher who believes fervently in the vital importance of her role in their lives.'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> says she has modeled her character on <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, the teacher killed aboard the shuttle Challenger. `` She was that kind of inspirational teacher,'' she says. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON> plays the principal, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belding </PERSON>, who insists the school and its classes be run exactly by the rules. `` Miss <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> wants to open up the world to the children and give them a sense of reality about history rather than just memorizing dates,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> says. `` Which brings her into conflict with the principal, who runs the school in a very conventional way with every guideline being the right and tested way.'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> had to swap her home outside of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for an apartment in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> to work on the series. `` One of the joys of working in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is that every morning you can look out and see the mist rise,'' she says. `` I'm up high enough that I can look down on the city. Early in the morning the tall buildings are shrouded in the mist.'' In <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, she lives in a little village along the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Her older son commutes to college in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the younger is in a private boarding school. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> has spent much of her time in recent years working in the theater, but she has done an occasional film. She went to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for `` Appointment With Death,'' an <PERSON> Agatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> mystery also starring <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. She worked in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> doing episodes of `` Amazing Stories'' and `` Murder, She Wrote.'' `` I came here in early 1988 to do the pilot for this show,'' she says. `` It was a surprise when the producer rang up and said it was on. I was completely unaware they had been negotiating.'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> also has just had published a book called `` My God,'' which is a compilation of how different famous people view God and life in the hereafter. She co-wrote the book with <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaine </PERSON>, her live-in companion of the past 4 -LCB- years. `` It was <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>' idea and I said, ` Let's do it,''' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> says. `` I've always been very interested in God and religion. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> had studied theology before he became a singer and songwriter. We wrote to the heads of all the major religions and got a cross-section of opinions from a lot of well-known people.''

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, a genial 30-year-old playwright, has written a comedy that includes such topics as yuppies, AIDS and the homeless _ all set against a backdrop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the late 1980s. It's a surprising mixture. Even more surprising, it works. The play, `` Eastern Standard,'' arrived on Broadway after a sold-out run at off-Broadway's <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Its cast consists mostly of unknown young actors. The exception is <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Meara </PERSON>, who plays a foulmouthed bag lady almost redeemed by these upwardly mobile youngsters. `` Almost'' is the key word here because nothing, these baby boomers learn, is as easy or as black-and-white as it seems. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, an architect, loves <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON>, a stockbroker. Drew, an artist, loves <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, a television producer. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> has AIDS. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>, a waitress, wants to help <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, the bag lady. And <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> dupes them all. Ask <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> to explain how he put together this unlikely combination of people and themes, and he launches into an extended history of the play. `` ` Eastern Standard' was a collection of several different impulses,'' says the author, relaxing in his agent's apartment. The play grew out of <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>'s last full-length work, `` The Maderati,'' a stylized farce about the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s young literary set. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> thought it would be his farewell to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as a playwright. `` I'm constantly saying ` I'm never writing about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> again,''' he says. `` But when ` The Maderati' did n't quite come off, I thought, ` Well, all right, one more.' And I wanted to write it in such a way that was n't so brittle and artificial. I decided that instead of inventing a world, I'd sort of figure out what the strains and tensions of the real world were and bring them together.'' Putting such topics as AIDS or the homeless in a comedy has perplexed _ and even angered _ some audiences. `` When you have a homeless person and a person with AIDS in a play and you're funny, it really ruffles some feathers,'' he says. `` I think there's an idea that seriousness is the same thing as sentimentality and unless you show what a devastating thing AIDS is and dwell on that, people get very wary.'' The comedy also has an ambiguity about its characters that can be unsettling, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> says. `` The thing about this play is that every character at one point seems to be right and at another point seems to be wrong,'' he adds. `` You can really be in a quandary as to what you are supposed to feel about them. There's a comfort in being told what you are supposed to think. In ` Eastern Standard,' you constantly have to change your mind.'' Especially, if most of the characters are yuppies, the one group <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> loves to hate the most. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> does n't even like to use the word. `` I call them the upper class or the upper-middle class now,'' he says. Some critics did n't even think they were worthy of a play. `` I felt that some of the people who have launched these attacks are living exactly the same way and the only thing that separates them from the people they are attacking is that they are attacking,'' the playwright says. `` I think there's an element of hypocrisy in that.'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, who resembles a slightly disheveled preppie, looks and talks a lot like the people he writes about. `` I know a lot of people like those in the play,'' he says, `` but no character is directly based on anyone I know.'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> began working on `` Eastern Standard'' in March 1987, the day after `` The Maderati'' closed off-Broadway. Writing 20 to 25 pages a day, he had a first draft ready in a few weeks. `` I've worked harder on ` Eastern Standard' than I've worked on any other play, although it came very quickly in that first draft,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> says. `` The arch, where it started and where it went to, always has been the same, but the journey there has changed a lot.'' The journey took the playwright to the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Repertory Theater where the play had its first full production last spring. Audiences there were enthusiastic, although local reviews were mixed. `` Eastern Standard'' got to Broadway through the persistence of producer <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> who first commissioned <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> to write a play specifically for the commercial theater. `` I was flabbergasted by the idea that this was a commercial commission and not for an institutional theater program,'' the playwright recalls. `` Then I began thinking, ` What makes plays commercial?' and ended up creating the most abstruse, inaccessible, unproducible thing I'd ever written.'' He finally gave that play up and then started work on `` Eastern Standard'' which <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> licensed to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Rep before it came to the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and then Broadway. The playwright springs from the middle class, the split-level suburbs of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where his father was a movie theater executive. His education was decidedly upper crust. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> and then tried the Ph.D. program in English at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> before ending up at the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to write plays. `` When I finally became a playwright, I thought, ` Oh, this works. I like it. This puts things together nicely,''' he recalls with a smile. While in his third year at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> had two one-act plays accepted at Ensemble Studio Theater, a tiny but well-respected <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater company. One was a big hit. `` So I started being employed as a writer, doing TV and film scripts, right out of school,'' he says. `` I do n't know what I thought I was going to do, but somehow I've managed to support myself as a writer.'' It's the writing for TV and films that drains <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> primarily because they involve so much collaboration. `` Plays excite me. They wake me up,'' he says, although he's never thought of himself as a Broadway playwright `` I think for playwrights of my generation, <ORGANIZATION> Broadway </ORGANIZATION> has never been a specific goal,'' he says. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> thought he'd write plays and have them done at small institutional theaters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or beyond and maybe some of them would move off-Broadway. `` Now there is all sorts of attention, from all sorts of directions, maybe because the play is controversial,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> says. `` The only way to have a play that is n't controversial is to write about nothing. But it's odd having everything so public. The idea of reveling in all that attention is very weird to me.''

^He Had Many Names, But Just Who Is That Christmas Child?</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just who was that man whose birthday is celebrated today? That, theologians say, is the main issue in regard to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. Was he just a man? A prophet? A great teacher? Or something more? Was he God mirrored in humanity? A lot of questions were asked about him while he lived, questions echoed ever since. Classic Christianity concluded he was something of a paradox, `` truly God and truly man.'' He's certainly not considered all of God. Did it mean that he manifests God, not in spite of, but because of his being truly, unreservedly human, while all others fall short of it? The mystifying assessment resonates with anomalies and further questions with which scholars have grappled through the centuries. The child, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, took on a variety of names, both at the start and through his robust, roving adult ministry. `` Emanuel,'' meaning `` God with us,'' was an early appellation, as recorded in Matthew 1:23. The Magi from the East referred to him as `` king of the Jews,'' the same title pinned on him at his crucifixion by the Roman governor <PERSON> Pilate </PERSON>. The names themselves weave a fascinating pattern of mystery in Scripture _ `` son of God,'' `` son of man,'' `` son of <PERSON> David </PERSON>,'' `` savior,'' `` messiah,'' `` the carpenter's son.'' Opponents called him a `` winebibber,'' a `` friend of sinners'' who `` has a demon.'' Many other names, peculiar, intriguing, cropped up in his time, and before it. Jewish Scriptures, seen by <PERSON> Christians </PERSON> as referring to him, say in <PERSON> Isaiah </PERSON> 53 that he was a `` man of sorrows'' by whose `` stripes we are healed.'' But <PERSON> Isaiah </PERSON> 9 calls him `` Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.'' The opening of <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s gospel calls him the `` Word'' of God, `` the true light that enlightens every man ... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.'' The missionary apostle <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Corinthians </ORGANIZATION> 4 calls him the `` likeness of God,'' a light that `` has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> the Baptist called him `` the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.'' When <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> asked his apostles who they thought he was, one of them, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, exclaimed, `` You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!'' He described himself variously in such graphic words as these: `` I am the light of the world.'' `` I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.'' `` I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.'' `` I am the vine, you are the branches.'' `` I am the resurrection and the life.'' `` I am the way, the truth and the life.'' The `` Father and I are one,'' he said, totally in accord, yet the `` Father is greater than I,'' but `` is in me and I am in'' him. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> also puzzlingly described himself as identical with the poor, the naked, the sick, the hungry and the imprisoned. `` Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it unto me,'' he says in Matthew 25:40. The closing Book of Revelation -LRB- Rev. 21:6 -RRB- pictures him as the `` Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.'' The missionary apostle <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> calls him the `` second'' <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> _ the inception of a new, unflawed and spirit-quickening life within humanity. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> summmed up the bafflement of it all in 1st <ORGANIZATION> Corinthians </ORGANIZATION> 13: `` For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Dangerous Liaisons''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sexual depravity among the French aristocracy was depicted in <ORGANIZATION> Choderlos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laclos </ORGANIZATION>' 1782 novel `` Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' with such sordid detail that it has been the target of censors ever since. In recent times it has been converted into a hit play by <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who has now written a film version with the anglicized title of `` Dangerous Liaisons.'' Directed with zest by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frears </PERSON>, the movie marks a welcome return to the traditional storytelling of films, playing dramatic events against the convincing backdrop of a historical era. Even the plot is pleasingly old-fashioned: The wrongdoers receive their comeuppance at the curtain. `` Dangerous Liaisons'' ignores the political ferment of late 18th-century <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to concentrate on the bedroom games of jaded aristocrats. The plotters of the intrigue are a pair well-matched in cool evil. The Marquise de Merteuil -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Glenn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Close </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is brainy but sex-obsessed, eager to avenge rejection by a former lover. Her aim: to assure deflowering of his 16-year-old future bride -LRB- Uma Thurman -RRB-. The notorious rake, Vicomte de Valmont -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> -RRB-, greedily accepts the challenge, but he decides that the conquest is too easy. So he also proposes a greater achievement: seducing Madame de Tourvel -LRB- <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> -RRB-, a devout, married woman. Valmont's prize if he succeeds: a long-postponed night with his co-plotter The scene moves to the country estate of Valmont's indulgent aunt -LRB- <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Natwick </PERSON> -RRB-, where he plots his campaign. Both missions completed, he is thrown off his game by falling in love with the saintly de Tourvel. Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Marquise </PERSON> has taken a young lover -LRB- <PERSON> Keanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> -RRB-. All this intrigue is resolved in a surprisingly moralistic manner. `` Dangerous Liaisons' is made more accessible by straight-forward American-style acting, and the language sounds contemporary despite an overflow of aphorisms -LRB- `` Vanity and happiness are incompatible'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> is inspired casting, displaying calculated mischief in contrast to her `` Fatal Attraction'' dramatics. The Valmont role might better have been played by <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON> or <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, but what <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> lacks in romantic dash he compensates with intense dramatic skill. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> delivers another of her splendid performances, and newcomer <PERSON> Uma </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> is impressive as she moves from virgin to wanton. <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Moonjean </PERSON> produced the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> film, which is superbly mounted. The rating is R for sexual content. Running time: 120 minutes.

 Videos reviewed this week: `` Big Top Pee-wee,'' `` Casual Sex?,'' `` Paramedics'' and `` Stormy Monday.'' `` Big Top Pee-wee'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95 - $ 29.95; Rated G
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> had a farm, e-i-e-i-o. And on this farm he had a talking pig named <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, a pony who could make pancakes and an entire circusful of strange but good-hearted performers. Here is Pee-wee practicing animal husbandry and agricultural science with smashing success but failing miserably at making friends with the local townsfolk, a bunch of certified sourpusses who clearly would like to string up our hero by his red bowtie. The one exception is <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, the local school marm, who seems truly smitten with the androgynous Pee-wee. Something is wrong, though; her blond tresses snarl painfully under Pee-wee's caress, and she persists in making him detestable egg-salad sandwiches for their lunch dates. The problem becomes clear when the circus, led by <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON>, drops in his yard a la Oz, after a storm. Here is the girl of his dreams: <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> the trapeze artist, played by the comely Italian actress <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Golino </PERSON>. Pee-wee's in love. Pee-wee, who is already a man-turned-boy, does n't exactly turn back into a man in this picture, but he does seem to be growing up. Whereas `` Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' saw him curling a painted lip at the prospect of a date with the local bike-shop bimbo, `` Big Top'' finds him as a full-blown romantic leading man, with lots of girl trouble, a real make-out scene and even _ gasp! _ sex, represented in a discreet yet cornball way. The story of how he wins over the poopy townspeople and helps the circus put on the best show ever is classic Pee-wee, as written, produced and performed by his alter ego, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON>. Full of all the fun stuff that makes his Saturday morning show so enchanting, the message here is that it's OK to be different. `` Big Top'' will make kids of all ages feel good about themselves. _ By <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryckman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> National Writer.

 `` Casual Sex?'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video; VHS, $ 89.95; Rated R -RRB- `` Casual Sex?'' was an OK idea for a movie. Two single women _ one frightened of sex because of AIDS, her friend just plain frightened of sex _ go off to a spa for a vacation of free-wheeling manhunting. But `` Casual Sex?'' is not an OK movie. It's silly, predictable and rarely funny. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> -RRB- despair of finding men with whom they can develop meaningful relationships. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> nearly married the wrong man, but otherwise has avoided much experience with men. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> counts off her former boyfriends, though her sexual exploits came to a screeching halt with the AIDS scare. So they talk about having sex for the fun of it -LRB- <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> recalls the time when she'd say to a lover, `` Wow, that felt great. What's your name again?'' -RRB- But what they really search for is romance and true love. At the `` <ORGANIZATION> Oasis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> have the requisite number of run-ins with awful, wrong men before true love strikes with the men they both had overlooked. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has an endearing deadpan delivery, and she and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> hit it off as pals. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dice </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> brings comic relief playing an oafish pickup artist with a heart of gold. Directed by <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rovert </PERSON>, `` Casual Sex?'' does try to deal with the sexual mores of the 1980s and with AIDS in a mature and humorous manner. It is probably an admirable effort _ but only occasionally a successful one. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Paramedics'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 79.98; Rated PG-13 -RRB- Do n't even bother to read this review let alone buy or rent `` Paramedics.'' You will only be wasting your time, unless you find sophomoric double entendres about bimbos and chicks amusing, or tired ethnic jokes a big laugh. Using the `` Police Academy'' format, this <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> hybrid dabbles in every formula of the trade. But where `` Police Academy'' had hilarity with its special breed of outrageous characters and situations, `` Paramedics'' just crawls along squeezing laughs from a dead storyline and lifeless characters. It stars <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Newbern </PERSON> -LRB- `` Adventures in Babysitting'' -RRB- as <LOCATION> Uptown </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> -LRB- `` Grease 2'' -RRB- as <PERSON> Mad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, two rowdy paramedics who use their custom-made city van to cruise the street for women, much to the horror of their dreadful boss. He reassigns the undynamic duo from their run in the posh part of town to a rundown area where they stumble into a street gang war and get involved in a heart transplant caper. In a fairly predictable sequence of events, <LOCATION> Uptown </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> emerge as heroes. But for all the action, `` Paramedics'' merely shuffles along. Also featured are <PERSON> Lawrence-Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Walston </PERSON> and the voice of <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellerman </PERSON> as a dispatcher. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 It's <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION>, and all that's tacky and distasteful about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has come to persuade this English industrial city to embrace the invasion. A clever setting for a romantic thriller, and `` Stormy Monday'' often is clever, as well as sultry and stylish. But it also can be too elusive and too violent _ there are beatings, shootings, bombings. <ORGANIZATION> Cosmo </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -RRB- leads the Americans, while <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> -LRB- Sting -RRB- is determined not to be pushed around and has brought the <ORGANIZATION> Krakow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION> to mark <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> at the nightclub he owns and the Americans want to buy. The musicians and the Americans all end up at the same hotel, as do the movie's love interests, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> -RRB-, who works for <PERSON> Finney </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> -RRB-, who had been involved with and seems to work for <ORGANIZATION> Cosmo </ORGANIZATION>. Much of the goings on are shadier than the shady characters. Why does <ORGANIZATION> Cosmo </ORGANIZATION> want control of <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION>? At one point, he explains: `` We ca n't be shooting people around here. We are supposed to improve the quality of life, provide jobs and make a lot of money.'' Yes, but ... Much of the cleverness involves the Polish musicians. When the Americans are about to hold a flag-waving reception, <ORGANIZATION> Cosmo </ORGANIZATION> learns his band is a no-show. So, the East Bloc band performs a Jimi Hendrix-like `` Star Spangled Banner.''

 `` Christmas Now Is Drawing Near'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Saydisc </LOCATION> -RRB- _ Sneak's Noyse. `` Thys Yool'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nimbus </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION>. `` Christmas Night'' -LRB- Collegium -RRB- _ The <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Singers </LOCATION> and the City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinfonia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON> conducting. Sneak's Noyse, a British early music group, promises that its carol collection is done with original instruments _ rebecs, penny-whistles, citterns and such _ and at first it may sound as if the consort includes a cat doing its death rattle. `` Oh Christmas now, is drawing near,'' the singers drone, doing their best to sound like tipsy amateurs out yowling for drinks and mince pies. Patience, however, will be rewarded. Among the 28 tunes is a lovely version of `` Sweet was the song the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> sang,'' a little-heard carol written down in the early 17th century. There's an unfamiliar tune, collected in 1952, for `` The holly and the ivy,'' and some delightful instrumentals: `` Fy, Nay, prithee <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' and `` The Furry Day Carol. If you must know what Furry Day is, the brief notes are no help. To get the most from the recording, the listener ought to be reading along in `` The Oxford Book of Carols,'' the handiest source of seasonal musical lore. The book explains that `` furry'' is from the Latin `` feria,'' which means holiday _ also the root of the word `` fair,'' as in village fair. <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeaping </PERSON>, the soprano for Sneak's Noyse, also appears on <PERSON> Thys </PERSON> <PERSON> Yool </PERSON>, a more austere Christmas recording from the <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION>. One of the jewels in this collection is a 14th-century song, `` As I lay on Yoolis night,'' in which the narrator imagines being present at the Nativity. `` ` Sing now, mother,' said the child, ` about what shall befall me hereafter when I become old.''' The mother responds with an eloquent shrug: `` Sweet son, wherefore should I sing? I never knew anymore about you but what <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> told me in his greeting.'' On the rollicking side, there's the song `` Tapster, Drynker,'' which is simply an appeal for one more round. After the austerities of authentic antiquity, as presently understood, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON>'s polished collection of standards is balm for the ears. <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON>, one of the rising stars in British choral music both as a composer and conductor, serves up familiar favorites starting with `` In dulci jubilo'' and on through `` <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> lay ybounden,'' `` The Cherry Tree Carol'' and even, one dreads, `` O <PERSON> Tannenbaum </PERSON>.'' Wretched sentimentality is avoided, however, by the professionalism and the sincerity of the performances. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Everything's Different Now'' -LRB- Epic -RRB-'Til Tuesday `` No one wants to be happier more than I do,'' <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> sings on `` Everything's Different Now,'' the third album by her band,'Til Tuesday. It's an awful thing to say, but music fans have a vested interest in seeing she does n't get her wish. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> has built a pretty good career on romantic torment. She recently broke up with boyfriend <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Shear </PERSON>, himself a songwriter with the band Reckless Sleepers, providing her with a mother lode of new material. Side 1 is a five-song suite that begins with the cautious optimism of the title tune, co-written with <ORGANIZATION> Shear </ORGANIZATION>, and ends with the angry <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> adding an expletive to the line `` life could be great'' that concludes `` -LRB- Believed You Were -RRB- Lucky.'' The natural temptation is to run in panic when you hear one of the songs is titled `` J for Jules'' and features a french horn. Somehow, she makes it work. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> is an imaginative writer, able to give a new twist to an old subject, and her mournful voice is brightened by strong pop melodies. `` I was counting to forever and never even got to 10,'' she sings at one point. `` When we found a rip in heaven, we should have just ascended then.'' Side 2 strays slightly from the dominant theme. `` Limits to Love'' is about a troubled girl who does n't respond to the love of her friends. On `` The Other End -LRB- Of the Telescope -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> duets with another noted wordsmith, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>. If you think <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> has a tough life, consider <ORGANIZATION> Shear </ORGANIZATION>, whose band released its debut album a few months ago. Not only is all his dirty laundry being aired in public, but his ex-girlfriend's record far outshines his. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` This Woman'' -LRB- RCA -RRB- _ K.T. <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON> <PERSON> K.T </PERSON> <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON>, who began her recording career at the age of 45, has soared to country music stardom on the basis of her excellent songwriting and a strong, expressive voice. Those strengths, as well as a glaring weakness _ squeaky-clean, middle-of-the-road pop arrangements that undercut the gritty real-life images of her lyrics _ are served up in equal measures on `` This Woman.'' The follow-up to `` 80's Ladies,'' her smash 1987 debut, `` This Woman'' features nine songs that look knowingly at the good times, bad times and silly games that make and break relationships. The best songs include `` Jealous,'' in which the singer fumes over a man who does n't know she's alive, while he runs after another woman who does n't know he's alive. <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON>'s growling, angry vocal, burning through a gorgeous piano melody, can not be ignored. And `` Where Is a Woman to Go'' offers a hangin' out at the bar tale from a woman's perspective. `` You know my daddy would die if he knew his baby was seekin' refuge in a little ` ol bar ` cross town,'' she `` But tell me where is a woman to go when she's feeling low?'' In fact, there's not a number on the album that really can be called bad. But a nagging feeling persists _ how would these songs sound with a nice little rough-edged band behind <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON>? Next time out, someone get This Woman such a band. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: TV Villain Makes Good on Big Screen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The strangest hit of the holiday season is a gag-packed feature version of a television series that lasted only four weeks, starring an actor better known for playing villains than getting laughs. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, who has a long record of evil-doing in films and television, is currently killing people with laughs in `` The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!'' The Paramount Pictures release is the work of <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, who previously made `` Airplane!'' and who specialize in titles and scripts with exclamation marks. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, 62, repeats the role of Lt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON>, the incredibly incompetent detective who appeared in the brief, lamented 1982 series `` Police Squad!'' The actor, who had appeared in `` Airplane!,'' recalled the inception of the show: `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> invited me to lunch, and they even pitched me! They did n't realize I was putty in their hands. Anything they wanted me to do, I was willing. `` They mentioned doing ` Police Squad' on television. Can you imagine me doing Lt. <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON> on TV under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Zuckers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>? Paradise!'' Sad to say, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> yanked `` Police Squad!'' after six chapters were made and four aired. Why? `` It did n't belong on TV,'' <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> theorized. `` It had the kind of humor you have to pay attention to. When you have a screen that is bigger than life, you can see what is going on in the background. You do n't have to search for it. `` You can watch it at home and look around and say, ` Gee, I'm going to get that door painted,' or ` Leave the telephone alone. There was no laugh track to bring the audience's attention back to the screen. It belongs up there on the big screen, -LRB- in theaters -RRB- where people have paid money to get in so they're not liable to waste their money by not paying attention.'' <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> explained that <ORGANIZATION> ZAZ </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- as the trio are called -RRB- originally planned to make a feature of `` Police Squad!'' but could n't find a plot long enough. So they fashioned mini-plots for a TV series. After years of trying, they came up with a story that pitted <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON> against <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantalban </PERSON> -RRB-, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> businessman who is really a killer. A large part of the appeal of `` Naked Gun-Police Squad'' can be attributed to <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s straight-arrow playing of the outrageous events. There is a certain madness in his method: `` The more seriousness, the more credibility you present in your demeanor when you're talking about insanity, the funnier it becomes.'' Although he was something of a practical joker as a boy in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> -LRB- `` We did n't know that water bombs would freeze on the way down from a second-story window'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> was not considered much of a comedian in his early years. One of three sons of a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountie </ORGANIZATION>, he served as a gunner in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and later studied at <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s radio academy in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Winning a scholarship to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Neighborhood Playhouse, <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> moved into live television, appearing on 46 shows in one year. His first movie was the title role in `` The Vagabond King.'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> signed him to a term contract, but he never rose from playing leads in B pictures and second-leads in major films. Moving into television, he specialized in heavies. `` In episodic TV they always needed a guest star,'' he said. `` The star was always the good guy, so the best part was the heavy. The meaner and more ferocious you were, the better the hero looked when he whipped you.'' He also briefly starred in his own series. `` I began with ` The New Breed,' and we did 36 shows in one year. Then I did ` <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON>'s World,' ` The Bold Ones' and ` Swamp Fox' at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, also ` Shaping Up' and ` Police Squad!' None of them went over a year. Some had only six shows or less. `` But maybe it worked out all right in the long run,'' he said. `` Because now I'm doing ` The Naked Gun' and I do n't have any track record with any one character that's endured. `` After 35 years in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, I finally realized that I had been cast against type. I've finally found my home _ as Lt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON>.'' The success of `` Naked Gun'' will undoubtedly lead to a sequel. `` Already they were working on a script,'' <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> disclosed. `` I'll be meeting in the Oval Office with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will send me to catch Mr. Big in the drug trade. I will be working directly with the mastermind of the anti-drug campaign, Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. They're thinking of asking <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> to play that part. `` Of course Mr. Big will turn out to be <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantalban </PERSON>. He died in ` Naked Gun,' but his evil twin is out there lurking. They may even call it ` The Wrath of <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>.''' He could be serious.

 When <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> publisher with minimal musical training, told the experts he wanted to conduct <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s Second Symphony, they told him it was possible but `` downright foolish.'' `` And they were right,'' the American magazine publisher says. `` But what you do n't know, you do n't know,'' he says. `` Someone once told me that a bumblebee, judged by aerodynamic principles, is incapable of flying. But the bumblebee does n't know that. So I kept going forward.'' Today, the 47-year-old has realized something of a fairy tale in musical annals. An untrained rank outsider, he has conducted <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s Second, `` The Resurrection,'' 13 times around the world and has just released a recording. The Austrian composer wrote eight other symphonies, but <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> has no interest in conducting them. He's sticking with the Second Symphony. `` I certainly feel qualified to learn other things but I do n't think of myself as a conductor,'' he says <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, who gave his first performance in 1982 with the American Symphony Orchestra, ca n't read music and has memorized the score. Some critics have accused him of using his wealth to indulge himself, while others have praised him. Married with four children, he publishes the magazine Institutional Investor and conducts for free. He hopes to perform the symphony next year in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> conducted with the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and sold out <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s 6,000-seat Royal <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> called his interpretation `` revealing and moving.'' `` This is no rich man's acted-out fantasy,'' he wrote. `` The <ORGANIZATION> LSO </ORGANIZATION> do not play with this kind of subtlety in the matter of dynamics nor with such careful instrumental balance unless the man with the stick has got his message across.'' <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in November for the release of his recording with the <ORGANIZATION> LSO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. He talked about his `` hobby,'' as he sat in his Savoy Hotel suite overlooking the Thames and the Royal Festival Hall where he conducted in 1984. `` I used to look across to the Festival Hall but I never thought I would ever conduct there,'' he said. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> studied music from age 7 to 10 `` like other American boys, and I stopped as soon as I could.'' In 1965, he was working on Wall Street when a friend took him to hear conductor <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokowski </PERSON> rehearsing <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s Second with the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> was sufficiently intrigued to go to the concert. `` I had never heard <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s music before and when I walked out of the hall I was a different person,'' he recalled. `` The first time you hear <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s music, you think it is charming. The first time you hear <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s _ if <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> can reach you _ you are changed in a very fundamental way. Even poor performances produce enthusiastic audiences and when I turn around, I can always spot the people who are hearing it for the first time. `` Mahler, more than any other composer, touches on very personal matters which, as children, we think about and then we tuck away and forget, to get on with our lives. `` Then <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> pushes the buttons again and everything comes back _ life, death, hope, despair, purpose _ all those things grownups do n't talk about.'' Over the next 15 years, <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> heard every performance of the Second Symphony in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Then I woke up one morning, and somehow I knew that one day I was going to conduct a symphony. I know it sounds preposterous,'' he said. `` I did n't know what it meant to conduct, did n't know that <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s Second is one of the most difficult works to conduct. I was n't trying to prove anything. I was n't climbing mountains and it was n't a mid-life crisis. I just knew I was going to conduct the symphony. I was on a conveyor belt and no way of getting off.'' As a member of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, he was able to get advice from musicians and conductors. He talked to more people, read and got nowhere. Then <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> found a young conductor, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bornstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, took him to his <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> home and worked nine hours a day for 30 days, memorizing an 83-minute symphony. The rest is history. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> rated <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>'s 1983 performance with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> among the year's 10 best. Other orchestras invited him to conduct and critics have praised his performances from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, who died in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1911 at age 50, was a zealous perfectionist whose musicians at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> called him `` the tyrant.'' <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, who owns <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s original score, says: `` He was a great notationist and could write down what he really wanted from the musicians. ... He tells you, ` Do n't slow down here,' because he knows the music has a tendency to slow down there. `` I try to conduct the music as closely as possible to what <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> wanted. I want people to hear what <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> wrote, not someone's idea of what he wrote.''

 Twenty-one years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> came to mean a rock band as well as elevated trains around the Loop. But the group had to shorten its name to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> when sued by the Windy City's Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. Now the seven-man <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which numbers its record albums rather than names them, has `` 19'' in the Top 100 on Cashbox magazine's best-selling chart A single from `` 19'' _ `` Look Away'' _ moved into the Top 10. The first single from the album, `` I Do n't Wan na Live Without Your Love,'' charted in the Top 10 in August. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, having survived the death of guitarist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kath </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cetera </PERSON>'s leaving for a solo career and a slump, is going strong. `` I think you have a sophisticated and educated listener,'' said Woodwinds player <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Parazaider </PERSON>. `` More people are musical than in the late'60s and'70s. Whether the crowd knows a B flat from a Z diminished, they know if you're not playing well.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has had time to learn to play well. `` As we sit here 21 years later, five of the six originals are still in the band. Six months after we began, we added <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cetera </PERSON> as bassist and lead vocalist,'' <PERSON> Parazaider </PERSON> said. `` The idea <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> -LRB- drummer <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraphine </PERSON> -RRB- and I had was, let's put together a rock' n' roll band with horns We'd incorporate horns as more than background licks. I think we've kept up with that.'' The group has had time to get jaded, too, but <PERSON> Parazaider </PERSON> says that has n't happened. `` They say we've sold 80-to-100 million records and had something like 33 top 40 hit singles. `` Every time I hear about a hit record, that's a thrill. Here's people buying your music, something that you create There's no jaded part to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. We are thoroughly pleased that people enjoy what we're doing.'' From their first album in 1969, `` <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>,'' the group became a big underground success and became known as a touring band. `` <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> took us on tour as opening act before we had a record,'' <PERSON> Parazaider </PERSON> said, recalling that <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> told him, `` Your horn section is like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me.'' <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> told him, `` When you get as famous as I'm going to be, and you will, do n't take it too serious.'' `` It meant a lot to me, a link to people that are legends,'' <PERSON> Parazaider </PERSON> said. `` That they respected us is great; I feel fortunate we touched base with them at all. We take it serious but this is n't brain surgery. Touring, he said, has always been one of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s strengths. `` The music we play on stage is free. But traveling, they ca n't pay us enough for that. We do tours of 130 shows in 150 days. ... We're always out there playing for whoever wants to hear us You get instant reviews.'' Of course, album sales have n't been constant for two decades. `` Glitter rock hit, punk and new wave. We stuck to the music we played and changed a little with the times. Around the 13th and 14th albums, in the late'70s, there was a lull. The 13th was gold. Up to then, they'd been multi-platinum. The 14th was n't gold. `` After selling 50 or 60 million records for <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, they ran for cover when things went bad.'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> dropped <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1983. `` It hurt my feelings,'' <PERSON> Parazaider </PERSON> said. `` It's like you can hit a grand slam last night and strike out tonight and they're going to boo. Fame is a transient thing.'' But he said he was n't bitter. `` It was a learning experience. Now I'm happy it happened. ... We got a slap in the face of reality and we needed it.'' At that time <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s management company advised the band to produce its own album to be shopped around. `` After we finished the 16th album, the response at the different record companies was tepid at best,'' <PERSON> Parazaider </PERSON> said. `` One label said, ` We'll get rid of the horns and sign a rhythm section.' That hurts your feelings and makes you mad. `` Our manager, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, said, ` After the first single is a hit the rest of the companies are going to be banging their heads.' Our next single was No. 1, ` Hard to Say I'm Sorry.''' `` 16'' was a gold album and `` 17'' was platinum.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> records on the Reprise label now. Parazaider, whose trumpet-playing Croatian father lives in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and whose mother was Czech, graduated from <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 in clarinet performance. He was inspired at 9 by seeing <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> on television. `` Money was n't abundant,'' Parazaider recalled, `` but my father got me a teacher. When I was 14 the teacher said I had surpassed him. `` He put me under the tutelage of the clarinetist in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Symphony. The relationship lasted until he died in the'70s. He saw the first big wave the band had in the early'70s and was quite proud. He played in <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> the week before we first played there. He left me a note backstage, ` OK, kid, just play in tune and do n't play too loud.''' The clarinetist plays saxophone, flute, keyboards and guitar but not clarinet for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankow </PERSON> -LRB- trombonist -RRB- arranges. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> -LRB- trumpeter <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Loughnane </PERSON> -RRB- and I sightread the parts. I think our musicianship has grown because of the stuff he has written that has challenged us,'' he said. Other members are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamm </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheff </PERSON>, who replaced Cetera, and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Champlin </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 `` A Bright Shining Lie,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s profile of Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vann </PERSON> and his war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, may turn out to be an enduring handbook for powers bent on foreign adventures. The National Book Award in nonfiction, conferred on the author Nov. 29, recognized literary merit and careful research. However, the book is more than a well-written biography. It is a study of futility on a world scale. <PERSON> Vann </PERSON>, a dedicated career officer, spoke out early in the war against the brutality and ineffectiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He learned at the battle of Ap <LOCATION> Bac </LOCATION> in 1962 how hard it was to kill a man dug into a hole if that man was determined to stay there until his enemy ran out of bullets and will. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, at the time <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> bureau manager, discovered it was scarcely easier for reporters to get across that simple reality in the face of prevailing wisdom back home. A decade of escalating technology, rising troop numbers and a burgeoning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment did not change those basic lessons. But the elusive light at the end of the tunnel captivated even <PERSON> Vann </PERSON>. In 1972, a civilian with the rank of major general and head of an uphill program to win hearts and minds, <PERSON> Vann </PERSON> died still fighting a war he thought he might win. He was director of the government's Civilian Development Program and was killed in a helicopter crash returning from battlefield inspection <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, who later reported for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and who helped report on the Pentagon Papers in 1971, spent 16 years sifting the evidence and then reciting facts so readers in a calmer time could draw clear conclusions. `` We had also, to all the visitors who came over there, been one of the bright shining lies,'' <PERSON> Vann </PERSON> remarked to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> army historian in mid-1963. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> used those words as a frontispiece. While the book is a finely etched portrait of a complex zealot, it also catalogs the false assumptions, self-delusions and miscalculations that widened a hopeless war. <PERSON> Vann </PERSON>, as a young adviser, watched ragtag guerrillas humiliate large U.S.-backed forces. He could not convince superiors that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s unmotivated army was in no shape to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION>. As a political analyst, he argued in vain that corrupt, autocratic leaders could not win over disaffected peasants, however much material and moral support they got from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In 800 pages of lively prose, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> never outlines in concrete terms the underlying message, but even the casual reader sees it: Exported ideology fares badly against a nationalist cause.

 Singer <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON>'s heart will always belong to her native <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> even though she's strayed far from home in the decade she's become a country music star. <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON>, from <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanes </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, had one of country music's biggest hits in 1988, `` 18 <ORGANIZATION> Wheels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; a Dozen Roses `` I find traveling broadens the horizons,'' she said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> where she was taping the TV show `` Hollywood Squares.'' `` But the funny thing is I've developed a stronger sense of home that's a real comfort.'' She's lived for 10 years in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where she has been working on her fifth album, scheduled to be in the stores next spring. Clearly happy with her thriving music career, she regrets only being too busy to visit her family and friends as much as she would like: `` My success has n't made a difference with my friends. I've only lost touch with the ones who would have drifted away anyway.'' It took years of work and six failed nominations before the 28-year-old <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON> `` made it'' in October with her recent Country Music Association award for single of the year for `` 18 <ORGANIZATION> Wheels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; A Dozen Roses.'' The event was a thrilling culmination to a year of rising record sales, growing concert audiences on a tour headlined by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Strait </PERSON> and her personal favorite _ her Valentine's Day wedding to songwriter <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezner </PERSON>. In 1978, she dropped out of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and headed for <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> after she found herself spending more time with a bluegrass band than on her studies. `` One of my band members was moving there, so I tagged along,'' she said. It eventually proved to have been the right choice: `` It was a town where I could flourish. I was n't threatened by its size.'' She had the usual round of jobs _ waitress and secretary, then tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame. She was singing demonstration tapes and advertising jingles when she signed with the Mercury label in 1983. A year later, her self-titled first album yielded three well-received singles and she was on her way. <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON> said she had always adored music and experimenting with it. She sang at her local church and with a folk band in high school. At the same time, she listened to all the pop music she could and absorbed her elder brother's wide-ranging interests in rock' n' roll. `` Since the age of 2, I've known I'd be some kind of entertainer,'' she said. `` I had a gut-level reaction to people like -LRB- <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> and early <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. They just made me want to cry.'' A teen-age passion for folk singer <PERSON> Buffy </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>'s music led <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON> to form an all-girl band, <PERSON> Buffy </PERSON>. She also played acoustic guitar and later, in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, mixed all her influences until a sound emerged. She calls it country-folk, and the sound came to fruition on her 1986 album, `` Walk the Way the Wind Blows.'' <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON> is at a point in her career when thoughts of failure can be frightening. `` Success is a subjective thing, and you find yourself wondering, ` Oh, God, can I really do this again?''' Coupled with that is anxiety about her image. `` I'm getting more comfortable with changing my hair and make-up,'' she said. `` It's real interesting because the traditional movement is so strong in country music.'' She also hopes to challenge tradition with her next album, which will include <ORGANIZATION> Celtic </ORGANIZATION> and Irish musical influences.

 Miracle cures and cheaper, healthier food are on the horizons of biotechnology, but for companies able to cope with the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic industry the future holds huge earnings. The <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biotechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> predicts that sales, now estimated at $ 600 million, will rise to between $ 25 billion and $ 30 billion in the year 2000 and between $ 75 billion and $ 100 billion in 2025. `` The first impact is going to clearly be on the medical side,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCamant </PERSON>, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Genetically engineered products to cure AIDS and some cancers, to make pork and beef leaner and healthier, and to protect crops from insects, weeds and the weather, are just a few of the promises held out by the industry. `` You will see biotechnology products all over the shelves in the next few years. It will creep into your life and continue to accelerate. Fifteen years from now we ca n't even speculate,'' <PERSON> McCamant </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains the leader in all aspects of biotechnology _ diagnostics, medicine, forensics and agriculture, analysts say. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and Western European nations are making inroads, partly due to a strong government role in financing and, in some cases, looser regulations. `` Funding for the basic sciences has gone down in the last 10 years. We're being hit pretty hard by the Germans, the English and the Japanese,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramlich </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agriculture research center in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> are the states having the most companies with biotech connections, said IBA spokeswoman <PERSON> Sherrod </PERSON> <PERSON> Shim </PERSON>. States benefit in taxes and jobs by supporting biotechnology, and can be good sources of startup funds, say state biotech center officials. However, in the long run, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biotechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> hopes to attract federal support and backing from pharmaceutical companies, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Namovicz </PERSON>, the center's executive director. Agencies like the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> have responded to challenges from abroad in recent years with more grants to universities and industry, but not everyone sees that as an answer. `` They are good to a certain point. They're more directed toward the research and what we're really about is developing a commercial product,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BioScience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have not yet taken their business to countries with looser regulations, such as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, one of three authors of `` Biotechnology and The Environment: International Regulation But it could happen, <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said, even though the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is studying whether to establish uniform rules that would probably lean toward those in countries like <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the stronger influence of environmental groups has led to tougher regulation. What companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory environment. The Patent and <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, facing a backlog of more than 6,000 biotech applications, asked the industry association in early November to train more patent examiners to handle the caseload. All over the country, companies are racing to develop new products. <ORGANIZATION> Cetus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has worked to develop polymerase chain reaction which lets scientists magnify a single piece of DNA, the molecule that carries genetic information. <ORGANIZATION> Cetus </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fildes </PERSON> said PCR simplifies diagnosticians' task of finding viruses from infected cells. It can determine in hours if a cell has been infected with AIDS, for example, something that would take six weeks using tests in a culture medium, <PERSON> Fildes </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lifecodes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is offering DNA tests to determine the guilt or innocence of criminal suspects from body fluids. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lifecodes </ORGANIZATION> will soon offer a kit that tests DNA samples of suspects' blood or semen to match them to samples taken from the crime. Turf battles between federal agencies trying to decide jurisdiction for each new biotechnology product and the constantly changing science complicate the task of companies seeking a piece of the market, said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, with the science advisory board for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're trying to make a patchwork quilt,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said. `` It's not easy to promulgate new legislation. The questions are all new.'' <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the regulatory process does not differ greatly from other products submitted to the agency. Regulation levels are appropriate and do not require further expansion, an assessment shared by most company officials, she said. However, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a group opposed to biotechnology in agriculture for economic and safety reasons, said, `` It does n't take a black heart to imagine the worst when the chemical companies are supplying most of the regulatory data.'' Groups like <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>'s and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based Foundation on Economic Trends contend the dangers of biotechnology have n't been sufficiently examined. Critics point to herbicides and pesticides that were once considered harmless and have been proven to pollute groundwater as reason to doubt the motives of any industry that is being regulated. The industry says fears of genetically engineered bacteria running wild mislead the public and legislators into seeking to toughen the regulatory road. `` The risks are sometimes greatly exaggerated of nature gone wild. We all grew up on the same movies of giant spiders that escaped laboratories and ate <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> ` </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> and vice chairman of the industry association More plausible dangers involve weed-control experiments that could backfire with the wrong gene implanted, letting the weed reproduce, and even that would be highly improbable because researchers start experiments with some idea of which genes accomplish what ends, <PERSON> D'Andrade </PERSON> said. The specialized knowledge and costly equipment required will keep the technology out of the wrong hands, and regulation coupled with companies' wish not to damage their credibility will keep products from being rushed onto the market without proper safeguards, he said. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said the company is used to regulatory mazes but it's harder for smaller firms. `` We're used to working within those kinds of boundaries. But a lot of smaller companies are bothered by regulations because it's so expensive and takes so much time. Smaller companies living off initial investment capital all feel pressure in an uncertain market to put products on the shelves, said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Gramlich </PERSON>. `` They can only survive so long in savings and research contracts. I do n't think any company can put 50 to 60 percent into research as some of these have and survive long.'' Smaller companies like <ORGANIZATION> Epitope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beaverton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, can no longer ask investors to wait, as in the early days of biotechnology, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, president. `` They're not satisfied with companies any more that say, ` We're going to lose money for six or seven years.' `` We've geared our work to very applicable things rather than heading into long-term things like cancer treatment.'' The competition also could reduce the number of companies. Executives predict one-third of the industry will be acquired within five years and nearly half within 10 years, according to `` Biotech 89: Commercialization,'' a report by <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts have expected that to happen for some time `` The progress of commercial biotechnology is unfolding with remarkable logic,'' said the report. `` Neither unexpected challenges -LRB- the stock market collapse -RRB- nor fully expected challenges -LRB- regulatory issues, patent disputes -RRB- have stalled an industry that has begun to show its strength.''

<HEAD>Venezuelan Doctor Studies Indian Tribe For Cervical Cancer Virus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study of women with radically different sex lives _ prostitutes and totally monogamous Indians _ found new evidence linking promiscuity to transmission of a virus that can cause cervical cancer. Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azocar </PERSON> compared pap smear samples from the prostitutes with those of <LOCATION> Piaroa </LOCATION> women, part of a strictly monogamous group that lives in traditional villages scattered in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation's <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. `` With this study the relation between the HPV virus and cervical cancer is strengthened, as is the hypothesis that the mode of transmission is sexual,'' said <PERSON> Azocar </PERSON>, a virologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. As early as the 1950s scientists observed that higher levels of cervical cancer seemed to be associated with promiscuity. A solid link between the human papilloma virus -LRB- HPV -RRB- and cervical cancer was n't made until the early 1980s by <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Richart </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Using genetic engineering to manipulate infected DNA, they found that the viruses most related to cervical cancer were certain strains of HPV. Later research using genetic material from the viruses confirmed their results. In 1985, <PERSON> Azocar </PERSON> began a similar study using viral genetic material in cell samples from <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> hospitals, and found that nearly 80 percent of cervical cancers in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> were associated with HPV. Cancer is the No. 2 killer in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and cervical cancer is the most common form in women. `` It is widely accepted among scientists that HPV causes cervical cancer, but it is thought that other factors are involved, including many births, early onset of sexual activity, and promiscuity. I wanted to see to what point these other factors were involved,'' <PERSON> Azocar </PERSON> said in a recent interview. Further study required control groups at the extremes of sexual activity. `` It's hard to find a control group of monogamous people, and with the <LOCATION> Piaroa </LOCATION> the girls are married off for life as soon as they get their first period,'' <PERSON> Azocar </PERSON> said. `` The only thing they required was that all the examinations be done by women gynecologists.'' Getting to the <LOCATION> Piaroa </LOCATION>, who had participated in an earlier AIDS study, was difficult. The 7,000-member tribe lives in an area the size of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> roughly between the <LOCATION> Parguaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in southwest <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and the town of <LOCATION> Tama-Tama </LOCATION> in Amazonas Federal Territory. Most still live in villages of less than 100. They fish, hunt small animals and birds and cultivate tubers and bananas as they have for hundreds of years. Those in less remote villages may have outboard motors for their canoes and wear western-style clothes, but their limited exposure to modern society ensures that their monogamous lifestyle is intact. Men of status may have two wives, but most have just one. There is no one from outside the village to fool around with, and tribal women are kicked out if they sleep with someone other than their husbands. <PERSON> Azocar </PERSON> and his colleagues were flown by army helicopter to three villages near the <LOCATION> Parguaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 290 miles south of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, where they took samples from 125 women. No evidence of HPV or cervical cancer was found. Examining a promiscuous group was easier. He conducted a two-month campaign among prostitutes in several cities nearest <LOCATION> Piaroa </LOCATION> territory for a cervical screening program and free treatment. Police helped spread the word. A team of gynecologists took pap smears from 130 prostitutes. Between 25 percent and 40 percent, depending on the city they lived in, had HPV, and among these there was a high incidence of different grades of pre-cancerous tumors. Both the <LOCATION> Piaroa </LOCATION> and prostitutes began having sex early, had multiple births, similar blood lines, live in the same climate, eat similar foods and are exposed to roughly the same frontier-style living conditions. Sexually speaking, the major difference was the frequency of sex, <PERSON> Azocar </PERSON> said. `` We showed that women who had many children and who started sex at an early age did n't necessarily have HPV. This provides solid data that cervical cancer is a sexually transmitted disease _ that the virus is the most important factor causing it and that promiscuity is the form of infection.''

<HEAD>White Has Folks Climbing Trees To Collect Pollen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUTHER, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> could get with his degree in biology was a job climbing trees to collect plants. But the job happened to be for a company pioneering in allergy work in the middle of hay-fever country, and now other people are climbing trees for him. His Crystal Labs supplies 40 percent of the powdered mold, pollen and other allergy villains purchased by labs that make allergy tests and vaccines. `` <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> is really the center point of all hay fever,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Within 500 miles are deserts, trees, hills and mountains, not to mention the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> grass and ragweed that flourish in the state itself. The location may be perfect and the business lucrative, but <PERSON> White </PERSON> says it also federally regulated, highly seasonal and workers can face some unexpected hazards when they venture into the wild collecting specimens. <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION> produces up to 1,100 pounds a year of powder from pollen, mold, animal skin, insects and food. His most expensive product is mites, part of house dust, which sell for about $ 3,000 an ounce when crushed to powder. Mold can be grown all year in the lab, but plants have to be collected for pollen at just the right time _ just before the pollen is released. The season begins in February with elms and runs through October's goldenrod. That's the busiest time for White's five employees and 20 contractors The work can have complications: Well-meaning citizens often assume that people collecting plants are doing something illegal. `` The most dangerous animal I have run into was humans,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` Almost everytime we go out and start collecting someone turns me in thinking I'm trying to collect marijuana.''

<HEAD>New Explanation For Why The Magnetic North Pole Wanders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Blobs of molten metal created where Earth's core meets the overlying rock may explain why the magnetic north pole wanders by about one degree every decade, a laboratory experiment suggests. Unlike the geographic north pole, where Earth's lines of longitude meet, geographers have noted changes for at least 1,200 years in the location of the magnetic north pole, which is where compasses point. Scientists generally believed that changes within the planet's liquid iron core were responsible for the wandering of magnetic north But blobs of molten core material created in the overlying mantle may be at least as important, according to the study by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> scientists. To simulate conditions at the core-mantle boundary, about 1,800 miles below <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s surface, they crushed samples of rock minerals and liquid iron between diamond anvils at pressures about a million times those at <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s surface and used a laser to heat the samples to more than 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit. The study found that molten iron reacts `` aggressively'' with the rock minerals, known as perovskites, which are composed of magnesium, iron, silicon and oxygen and which are thought to be the main material in the lower mantle. Such reactions could create blobs of iron-rich metal alloys in the lower mantle that might deflect magnetic field lines generated in the core and could explain why the magnetic north pole wanders, the scientists said. <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> geophysicist <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanloz </PERSON> presented the study during the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>`Biomuse' Could Let The Paralyzed Play Music</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A synthesizer and computer can tap into the body's `` symphony of electronic voices'' to let the paralyzed make music by moving their eyes or dancers accompany themselves, scientists say. <PERSON> Biomuse </PERSON> would let `` a dancer create music directly from the play of muscle activity underlying the movement itself,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusted </PERSON> and <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicince </ORGANIZATION> in a research paper. The idea of making music from the body's electric signals is n't new But Lusted and <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> wrote that electrodes placed on skin `` pick up many different signals simultaneously which merge to form a background of noise,'' and the Biomuse computer can select desired signals to make music. `` The body is literally a symphony of electrical voices, sounding at different frequencies and intensities,'' they wrote. `` By placing the pick-up electrodes on the upper arm, we can tune in to bicep activity. `` Next, we instruct the processor to record the intensity of the electricity coming from the bicep. Then we tell the device to translate that electrical intensity to note number on the synthesizer keyboard, such that low intensity -LRB- relaxed -RRB- gives low notes and more muscle tension produces progressively higher notes. `` The slightest movement produces immediate sound from the synthesizer. Thus, simply by tensing and relaxing one arm, the musician can run notes up and down the keyboard.'' It also could use other muscles, brain or heart activity. `` Since the device can use any available nerve or muscle electricity as a control signal to the synthesizer, a disabled person can learn to make music _ even using eye movements,'' the scientists wrote.

<HEAD>Magnetic Device Lets Doctors Spot Potential Spinal Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Surgeons who corrected <PERSON> Nicolasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON>'s scoliosis used a magnet during the operation, stimulating her brain to make her limbs twitch and demonstrate that they had n't damaged any nerves or arteries The surgery reduced the curvature of the 27-year-old Guatemalan student's spine to remove the pressure on her organs that kept them from functioning normally. The electromagnet, she says, `` saved me from being paralyzed.'' The spinal cord carries sensory signals to and from the brain. Doctors generally use small electric shocks to the limbs and electrodes on the scalp to test whether the spine is intact and those signals are getting through. The use of the doughnut-shaped attached to the patient's head lets doctors to be more aggressive with some spinal procedures, said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and co-director of the <PERSON> Kenton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leatherman </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Spine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> and Kosair Children's hospitals. About two years ago, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> heard that researchers in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> were stimulating the brain with a pulsed magnetic beam to diagnose nervous-system disorders. Because the magnet can trigger nerve cells in only the part of the brain that controls limb movement, they wondered if it might let them test the spinal cord while avoiding some of the side effects of electrical stimulation. In April 1987, they started testing magnetic stimulation on rats, then on themselves, students and secretaries _ about 60 volunteers. They found that the magnet triggered twitching of arms and legs if placed over the correct region of the brain. The muscle activity is measured and analyzed by a computer. The doctors have used the procedure on 48 patients, and it has failed to trigger movement in about 20 percent. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, research director for the anesthesiology department, said anesthesia may be suppressing those patients' leg muscles. `` I'm very enthusiastic about it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, an anesthesiologist who has used the technique in about 20 operations at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> medical center. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said she foresees other uses for the magnet, such as in monitoring the sciatic nerve during hip surgery.

 It was the year they held a presidential election and half the nation's voters decided to stay home. It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered, barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the world. It was the year an early decision to let <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> burn altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come. It was the year <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> decided to diet, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> decided to resign, evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> decided to confess his sins and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> decided to challenge world heavyweight champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. Some decisions worked; others did n't. Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two surviving whales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> bowed out, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over. <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, the TV host, lost 67 pounds. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, however, officials realized too late they might have made the wrong decision. By the time firefighters arrived, unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of control, forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among area residents. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> preached on but lost much of his audience after the Assemblies of God decided to defrock him. <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> lasted for just 91 seconds and eight decisive blows. The wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen. Faced with the choice between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and frustrated by one of the most low-down, dirty presidential campaigns ever, an ambivalent electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to overwhelming inertia. `` I've always loved election years,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, but it seemed hardly anyone else did. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 54-46 percent victory over his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout, the lowest in 64 years. Political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many voters were n't voting for anyone so much as they were voting against the other guy. They also determined that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost 2 percent of his supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision _ to tap as his running mate <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the first `` baby boomer'' on a national ticket and a choice that surprised even <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers. It was Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the silver-haired, smooth-talking senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who provided the only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates. `` Senator, you are no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a flustered <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, after the 41-year-old senator had compared himself with the late Democratic president. The Kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation. The 25th anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on idealism lost and a world changed. Nowhere was that change more apparent than in U.S.-Soviet relations. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago, shunned <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> when he visited <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first Soviet leader since <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to taste the Big Apple, had a super-power lunch with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Dec. 7 and addressed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, he promised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armed forces. The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated 60,000 had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole cities crumbled under the quake's force. Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in from around the world. It was the first time since World War II that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had accepted disaster relief from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> paid his first visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in June for a summit that failed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammered away on human rights issues, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later sent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> living proof of his commitment to change. Nobel laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, father of the Soviet dissident movement, was allowed his first trip outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies. Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than 5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began in July in 32 cities and continued through the year. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old, intact. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, confirmed as a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice by a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but gave no hint of his views. Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the once-powerful. Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, the king and queen of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate, pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges. Republican <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> became the first governor in a half-century to be impeached and removed from office, although he was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to restore military aid to the Contras but decided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels and the Sandinista government reached a temporary truce. In a decision that stunned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized talks with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the first time in at least 13 years. `` Our object is not a dialogue,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` Our object is peace.'' Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talks opened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but the guerrilla war raged on.

 When it comes to bridal fashions, the word is options. A bride can choose a ball gown, a country dress, a sheath or a tailored suit, say designers and editors who work in the bridal field. There are no rules, only guidelines. She can look demure, like <PERSON> Cinderella </PERSON> at the ball or _ in a departure from tradition _ alluring in a strapless or off-the-shoulder dress with a low-cut neckline. Dresses with jackets and detachable trains also make it easier to go from religious service to post-ceremony party with maximum comfort. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> McMunn </PERSON>, of Bridal Originals, says there are more choices in fabrics, style and color for brides than at any time in the recent past. She sees several strong directions. `` One type of bride wants a simple dress in a classic silhouette _ a princess, empire or sheath style. Another type chooses an elaborate dress,'' she says. There is also a demand for the fashion statement dress _ particularly by older brides who may be remarrying _ that reflects silhouettes currently in style, she says. While white and ivory remain the colors chosen by the overwhelming number of brides, soft tinges of color are becoming more popular, agree Modern Bride and Bride's magazine fashion editors. One new tinge is ice-blue on satin dresses, which imparts a silvery sheen to white. Still popular are color-themed weddings, in which a particular color scheme is carried through in flowers and decorations, wedding party attire, table linen, plates, even party favors. Some favored schemes include black and white, and white and a deep tone such as hot pink, coral or strong turquoise. For spring and summer, pastels such as mint and lemon yellow are popular. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, fashion director for Vogue-Butterick Patterns, says the latest styles are available in sew-it-yourself patterns. Some examples include dresses with bows at the shoulder or waist, ruffles, leg-o-mutton sleeves and even modified bustles. According to <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, `` Bridal dresses are frankly not as innocent as they used to be _ with bustles and low necklines, they do call attention to a woman's figure. Many brides want to look like a sexy woman so the dresses they select have more style.'' An advantage to having a home-sewn dress is the opportunity to customize it with, for example, a detachable train, snap-off sleeves or a coat, jacket or bolero. In keeping with the variety of bridal dresses, accessories are similarly wide-ranging, according to fashion reports by Bride's and Modern Bride. Modern Bride notes the popularity of hats, sprays of flowers for the hair and bows worn at the back of the head. Bride's says jewelry for the bride has become more dramatic than it used to be. Seen on more brides are drop earrings, charm bracelets and antique pins and earrings. For bridesmaids, dresses in floral prints and polka dots with low necklines or halters worn under jackets are popular. For the mother of the bride and the groom, soft pastel colors in fabrics like lace, velvet, silk moire and taffeta are more popular than the glittery dresses of several seasons ago. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> says the use of expensive details such as re-embroidered fabric for brides and their attendants is also growing.

The most significant trend in bridal flowers is toward bright, hot colors, according to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> floral designer.

 The sartorial role of the groom and his attendants is to complement the attire of the bride and her attendants, says <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>. The designer of women's couture and of men's suits and sportswear, <PERSON> Blass </PERSON> says it is most important that the men's attire should be appropriate for both the occasion and the women's dresses. For a simple country wedding, a morning coat would seem exaggerated. For a city wedding, a navy blazer and white flannel pants would be a little too casual. Choose clothing suited to your build, your age, the time of year and occasion and the circumstances of the wedding, he advises. And do n't overdress, even though this may be the biggest day of your life. To <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>, it is never appropriate for a man to look like the little figure on the top of the wedding cake. Instead, he suggests quiet, classic clothing for men. In winter, a tuxedo; in summer perhaps a white dinner jacket. `` You ca n't go out and rent a character for the day of the wedding. What is appropriate is what suits you,'' says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>, an associate of <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>. `` We see some tragic mistakes when we pass a church and notice a groom in a powder-blue tuxedo with a ruffled shirt. You can see they are mortified because the clothes have nothing to do with their life.'' Fashions for grooms and groomsmen do n't change much over the years, and that's fine with <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>. On the other hand, not everyone takes quite the classic approach. According to <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of After Six, manufacturers of dress clothes for men, grooms are becoming more adventurous in selecting bridal attire. They are moving away from the traditional clothing of the past four years. `` There is a groundswell of interest in more free-wheeling design, such as jackets with much broader shoulders, mess jackets with nipped-in short waists and elongated, slightly wider lapels on jackets,'' he says. Shiny, textured fabrics, especially in medium tones of gray and in black tone-on-tone fabrics, are popular. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is more often chosen than it was in the recent past and in some areas of the country, such as the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, midnight blue dress clothes are also `` in.'' Even in traditional styles, unorthodox fabrics, such as herringbones, are being used for the suits. The fabrics were first found on European brands but now many American manufacturers are offering them, he says. Hall says other trends include the return of the low-cut, three-button vest to match the jacket, and the growing popularity of double-breasted jackets. Fabrics differ little from summer to winter; worsted wool is first choice.

 Why not actually serve the cake as dessert at the wedding? Cake baker and author <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beranbaum </PERSON>, who wrote `` The Cake Bible,'' knows perfectly well why wedding cakes may be the least appreciated portion of the wedding food: Most are not nearly as tasty as they look. She says that the tradition of the tasteless wedding cake can be banished by baking your own; she includes a section on how to bake and decorate wedding cakes in her book. <PERSON> Beranbaum </PERSON>, who once made wedding cakes professionally as well as teaching others how to do it, has put away her cake pans now that her book is out. But she says that with two days to spare and a certain amount of patience, the bride, a doting relative, or friend can bake a cake to serve 150 in the ordinary home oven. She presents formulas for a variety of cakes and icings and shows how to decorate and how to calculate quantities for virtually any size cake. Though the labor is one of love, not economics, a homemade wedding cake is almost sure to cost substantially less than a bakery cake _ `` even if you blow $ 100 on white chocolate for the icing.'' The reason most people undertake such a project is to have a unique cake, which may be white, golden, carrot, chocolate or cheese. The only requirements are tiers and icing. <PERSON> Beranbaum </PERSON> says that while baking a large cake is not necessarily harder than baking lots of small cakes, the methods vary. For example, large cakes actually take proportionately less baking powder than small cakes do. The larger cakes also have a tendency to get too brown at the edges before the centers are done. Aluminum strips can be used to retard browning the sides so the center can be cooked through. Some tips: Use cake flour, not all-purpose or self-rising flour. Make sure that the butter is softened before it's added to the batter. If it is n't, the cake mixture wo n't be aerated properly and the cake will be tough and flat. Oven temperature is critical in baking a large cake. She advises that before baking a large cake, bake a small one and see if it takes longer than the recipe. `` A cake that bakes fast might be a little humped, but a cake that bakes slowly will never be tender, so raise the temperature in a slow-cooking oven,'' she says A tiered cake needs support. In commercial bakeries, the supports are wood dowels. Plastic straws work fine at home, she says. The simplest wedding cake to make is a white or yellow butter cake with butter-cream icing. `` Give it two full days _ one day to make the components and one day to put them together and decorate the cake,'' she says. You can make some decorations ahead of time. For example, marzipan roses can be stored for years. Most cakes do n't have to be refrigerated overnight, she says. As for transporting the cake, she says that there are only two people fit for the job: `` The person who made the cake or the person who is paying for it.'' The safe method is to place the cake in a box whose sides are rigid and keep the largest bottom layer from touching the sides. Provided there are not too many bumps on the ride, the cake should survive without a blemish. The cake that launched <PERSON> Beranbaum </PERSON>'s reputation was a four-tiered creation covered in what looked like dotted swiss fabric with a trim of roses. She developed it for <ORGANIZATION> Bon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appetit </ORGANIZATION> magazine as an example of what could be done at home. `` That cake changed my life,'' she says. `` I got so many calls I decided to teach intensive classes in special occasion cake-baking.'' The information she compiled for the classes and the experiences she had baking the wedding cakes led her to develop the formulas and expertise that are found in her book.

 Wedding traditions that once were thought old-hat are back. `` Bridal couples are getting pleasure by doing things the old-fashioned way,'' according to <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Tober </PERSON>, editor of Bride's magazine For example, she says, `` calligraphy once again is in fashion for invitations and people are thinking of toasts in advance and caring about the fact that someone should say something at the reception. `` Couples are embracing the idea of dressing up, sending out invitations in advance, putting announcements in the newspaper. They have music, they carry flowers, they say their vows. Brides are having attendants, throwing bouquets, wearing a garter and cutting the cake,'' she says. The once-overlooked personal letter of thanks to friends and family for wedding gifts is again in favor. Though pre-printed thank-you cards are available, etiquette experts agree that the sincere and courteous way of expressing thanks is with a hand-written note. As the arbiter of the'80s, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> `` Miss Manners'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, put it: `` The only time a handwritten thank-you note is not necessary is when no wedding present has been received.'' According to the Bride's Book of Etiquette, another exception to the requirement for a note is acknowledging gifts from parents or a spouse. However, it's also duly noted that parents and spouse will appreciate a special letter of thanks. For all other thank-yous, the first requirement is to keep a thorough and reliable gift record. Keep track of gifts in a wedding journal, a notebook, index cards or even on a computer. Record the gift along with the name and mailing address of the giver so it will be simpler to get the thank-you note on its way quickly. Indicate when you've mailed it, so you wo n't overlook any. While it has been traditional for the bride to acknowledge all gifts, today it's also quite acceptable for the groom to share the responsibility by writing to those whom he knows best. Etiquette requires the use of folded note paper in white, ivory or the shade of the wedding invitation. The stationery can be plain or embossed or printed with your name or initials. But the bride should n't send stationery imprinted with her married name until after she is married. A note should mention the gift and refer specifically to something about it, such as its usefulness or style. If you are not quite sure what the gift is, compliment an unusual or unique feature such as color material. Mention your spouse's name in the note since, as a rule, only the writer will sign it. Conclude with a friendly closing sentence. The timetable for thank-yous calls for a note within two weeks of the arrival of the gift. If the gift arrives on the wedding day or during the honeymoon it should be sent within a month after the honeymoon, says Bride's. A good reason for writing notes a few at a time is that it's easier to make the words of thanks spontaneous and sincere than if you tackle several dozen notes at once If you expect to receive more gifts than you think you can acknowledge right away, you can send printed cards to let donors know the gift arrived safely and follow up with a personal note as soon as possible.

 `` The champagne toast is one of the few times during the reception when someone other than the bride and groom has center stage,'' says <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Croix </PERSON>, chef de cave at Piper-Heidsieck. Traditionally, the best man offers the first toast to the couple, but others may do so. Whoever gives the toast should agree on the message with the groom ahead of time. <PERSON> LaCroix </PERSON>'s tips for a toast: The toast takes place after the bride and groom have been received and the guests have taken their seats. The person giving the toast stands to the right of the couple while the newlyweds remain seated. The groom rises after the toast and offers another to his bride and her family. The bride may respond by welcoming the groom into her family. Guests usually stand for the toast.

 When the wedding is over, the honeymoon is supposed to begin. But most couples discover that the honeymoon phase does n't last out the first year of marriage, says psychotherapist <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Modica </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>. The author of `` Why Did I Marry You, Anyway?'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> -RRB- says that some couples panic when they realize they are n't going to live together without conflict. They should n't. `` Negative emotions are a normal part of living with another human being and ` happily ever after' is a fiction,'' she says. The fact that most divorces take place in the first three years of marriage shows that an unrealistic idealization of marriage can be harmful. `` Any little disappointment makes them think they were wrong. Since divorce is now socially acceptable, they take the easy way out. Then they go out and marry the same kind of person again,'' she says. By knowing what to expect and focusing on methods of communicating in the first year of marriage, couples can resolve inevitable stresses, which in turn gives the marriage strength to endure. In an interview and in her book, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> identified a three-stage pattern similar to the steps a baby takes along the pathway to independence. In the first stage, each believes the other can fill all emotional needs. It's soon succeeded by the realization that some of your needs wo n't be instantly met: `` You start to think you made a mistake, that your spouse tricked you. `` The third stage is to join the images and realize that your spouse is an integrated human who has foibles and flaws as well as wonderful traits. Ideally, you both emerge with a sense of constancy in which you believe that the marriage will endure in good times and bad,'' she says. `` This generation thinks it is a good idea to be completely open when you are angry. Fights are healthier than sitting on your negative feelings for a year and then simply leaving. But you have to know how to reveal your feelings. `` Ask yourself: Is my spouse going to be receptive to hear this now, and how can I phrase it so he or she will not feel unduly attacked. `` Start your sentences with I _ as in ` I feel hurt being ignored at a party.' Stick with the issue at hand; do n't make it a laundry list of everything that's ever bothered you.'' She says old-fashioned rules of politeness should not be abandoned as soon as the wedding finery is taken off. The politeness of courtship can be continued to a great degree and it is usually a bad idea to be completely honest all the time. Between money and sex, she identified money as the more troublesome issue. `` Most courting couples have terrific sex lives but money is a taboo. All of us have learned illogical ways of dealing with money and, because we are marrying later, we are used to managing money. Two quirky patterns that are different create a real problem.'' Strategies for coping include hiring a financial consultant to help you de-emotionalize the situation or even separating finances. Many couples make the mistake of coming together financially without discussing their differing patterns. She says it may make more sense to start out separately and come together with more understanding later on. Though sex is less likely to be a bone of contention in these days of more open discussion, she says that it's normal for the frequency of activity to decline after marriage. No matter what the problem, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> says that flexibility usually helps solve it. `` The people who will adjust best to marriage are those willing to try new ways of behavior in order to figure out what they want and how to get it,'' she says.

 It sometimes seems as if Americans are marrying earlier and more often. Statistics show that 36 percent of the weddings today are remarriages, according to Bride's magazine. Furthermore, says <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Tober </PERSON>, editor of the magazine, half of all Americans divorce and remarry in their lifetime and the majority of women who divorce remarry within about three years. Paradoxically, even though `` they are trying very hard not to divorce and to pick the right friend, partner and pal, if they do n't, they can not stay in the marriage in these days of lengthened lifespan and vigor,'' says <PERSON> Tober </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Cele </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalli </PERSON>, editor of Modern Bride, one of the most striking changes in recent years has been in attitudes towards remarrying. `` In the past, one did n't advertise a remarriage; one just unobtrusively did it. Today, people flaunt it. There is no sin in making a mistake and it is wonderful to find happiness,'' she says. Weddings that are remarriages are being planned with just as much dedication as the first-time wedding, but there are some differences, agreed these authorities. For one thing, the couples usually make the arrangements and pay for the wedding themselves. For another, if there are children from an earlier marriage, they are often part of the wedding. The remarriage wedding may well be smaller than the average first wedding today, but not always. Many of the parties are elaborate evening events with dinner and dancing, says <PERSON> Lalli </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Tober </PERSON>, a second or third wedding is often a more intense though quieter event. There may be a much closer bond between the couple and the guests they choose to invite. `` The guests are often people who have been supportive during a divorce or widowhood. They accept the new relationship. They are the people you want in your life in the future,'' she says. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamacchia </PERSON>, who produces bridal shows, says that companies providing wedding services are now paying more attention to the remarriage wedding market. Based on his observations of these events at which a mix of local service providers and national companies sell their wares, he says that `` couples seem more clear-minded about the type of wedding they want.'' The bride tends to choose a more practical dress that can be used for other occasions, or at least she will buy a dress that reflects her fashion style. The party is more likely to be at home or in a restaurant, not at a catering hall or a hotel ballroom. Photography is likely to be more creative and candid. They are n't going for multiple albums. Wedding announcements and invitations tend to be less formal and sometimes humorous. People are still self-conscious even though the taboos have diminished quite a bit. He says that nonsectarian ceremonies are more common at second-time weddings. <PERSON> Tober </PERSON> says that at remarriages, the issues of etiquette can be more difficult to settle. For example, she says she receives letters concerned with dissension in the family, such as where to seat factions of the family, whether to invite former in-laws and how or whether to include the children in the wedding. `` When I am asked if kids should be in the wedding, I say, ` Are they going to be in the marriage?' If they are, then have them in the wedding. We even suggest that couples go on a honeymoon alone first but have the children join them later,'' she says.

 A little help from their new friends in the bridal registry is what couples-to-be are relying on in these days of greater interest in home entertaining, but less time for shopping. Typically, the registrar helps coordinate dinnerware, flatware and stemware patterns and also takes the bride _ increasingly accompanied by the groom _ through an ever-expanding list of choices to make in other categories Gift-givers use the registry to select a gift that's wanted by the couple. The return to traditional weddings carries over in choices young couples are making for their crystal, silver and china, say registry directors in department and specialty shops. For example, there's a renewed interest in crystal among bridal consumers, according to <ORGANIZATION> Cleverley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, bridal registry director at <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She says that brides are registering for more items than they used to, including candlesticks, vases and pitchers. They're choosing more expensive stems, too The average price per glass is between $ 27 and $ 35. Many register for two stemware patterns to go with the two sets of dinnerware that they select. Besides the silverware, fine china and crystal that are traditionally listed, the nation's estimated 5,000 bridal gift registries are increaslngly listing more unusual gifts desired by brides and grooms-to-be. Some examples on recent lists include exercise equipment, bicycles, fully-stocked picnic baskets, home electronic equipment such as camcorders and computers, cooking appliances such as ice cream makers and pasta machines, and art objects. There are, however, some distinct geographic differences. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> couples are registering for patio furniture, garden tools, beach umbrellas, barbecue grills and bikes, according to <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahabedian </PERSON>, registry director at The Broadway in <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Couples do n't always register for fine crystal and china. Many of my clients tell me they want to purchase those items later on in their marriage,'' she says. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, art objects and handcrafts such as one-of-a-kind serving dishes are popular with couples registering at <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>'s gift department. Another <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area trend is registering at non-traditional shops such as <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Deluca </PERSON>, a gourmet food shop. A source at the store noted that couples come to register for everything from pots and pans to cooking tools. Also popular are gift certificates for specialty foods. All over the country, interest in ethnic foods has enlarged the range of utensils newlyweds want, says <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupper </PERSON>, national spokesman for the gourmet gadget chain of <ORGANIZATION> Williams-Sonoma </ORGANIZATION>. Pasta machines, paella pans, even nutmeg and cheese graters are registry items with this chain,. `` In the 15 years I've been with the company, I've seen some things that have n't been listed for years come back _ like fondue pots and pressure cookers, which make it possible for working couples to cook quickly,'' says <PERSON> Kupper </PERSON>. Although it's customary to include inexpensive as well as big-ticket items on a wish list, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, bridal registry director at <LOCATION> Neiman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcus </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, says that `` a wedding celebration is one occasion for which you need n't be shy about extravagant requests.'' Some couples have registered for one-of-a-kind crafts such as a $ 3,000 punch bowl by <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafner </PERSON> or trendy silver, <LOCATION> china </LOCATION> and crystal such as that bearing the Swid Powell label. With couples' wish lists growing more varied, the nation's bridal arbiters are advising gift givers to be more original, too. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Tober </PERSON>, editor of Bride's magazine, says wedding guests should give something the couple want, but also should personalize their gift. For example, a donor might match up wine goblets and wine, a requested teapot with a basket of exotic herbal teas,, fragrant soaps with chosen bath towels, family photos with a selected silver frame, a set of parfait dishes with an ice cream maker, or a crystal vase and a gift certificate for flowers-of-the-month.

 You're getting married in a month or two and you find yourself daydreaming about all the things that might go wrong at the wedding and in the marriage. Does this mean you should call the whole thing off? No, say two authorities who have talked to many brides and grooms. <PERSON> Jerilynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Phobia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, says that it's normal and appropriate to worry about the unknown. <PERSON> Cele </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalli </PERSON>, editor of Modern Bride, sees the realization of potential conflict as a sign of maturity in the age of divorce. Both say it is n't the worries you should worry about, but what you do about them. In a recent seminar she conducted for Bride's, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> noticed both brides and grooms-to-be had more fears than they realized and had n't discussed them `` Merely learning that others worried about similar fears made the participants feel better because they had felt their worries were unique. In many instances, the partner was surprised to learn of the fears,'' she says. This observation led her to conclude that communicating worries may be all that's needed to relieve them. `` Even if you need to go a third person such as a therapist or religious leader to get the worry out, it's best to reveal it,'' says the psychologist who counsels at <ORGANIZATION> Roundhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phobia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lalli </PERSON> says that because couples getting married now are generally older than couples in the recent past, there are more potential wedding conflicts between them and the way their parents do things She sees this as a plus, not a drawback. `` That's what marriage is all about _ separating from the family. Working out conflicts that may develop over the wedding is the often the first opportunity to act as a couple,'' she says. One reason why worries may be more overt but less troubling is that there is wider latitude in what's considered acceptable and greater awareness of a need to communicate. Couples are less inhibited about talking about conflicts, says <PERSON> Lalli </PERSON>. In general, both women agreed that issues that couples worry about fall into one of two main categories: practical concerns relating to the ceremony and party and philosophical concerns about the durability of the bond they are assuming. Today's different way of life has created both the problem and its solution. For example, higher costs force different financial arrangements. `` Traditionally, the bride's family paid for just about everything. Practically speaking today, that is difficult. If both families want an extravaganza, they are more flexible about paying for it. The traditional guidelines are not relevant,'' says <PERSON> Lalli </PERSON>. `` Because of greater mobility and fact that couples often meet and live in a city other than the one where the bride grew up, there's often some concern about where to have the wedding. Today, the right decision is what is most convenient and least expensive,'' she says. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> characterized most worries of couples about to be married as normal worries about the future. It's only if the worries become irrational, involuntary and inappropriate that phobia _ a psychiatric disorder _ is involved. Despite role changes in recent years, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> says men and women at the seminar she conducted worried along traditional lines. `` The women all talked about their fears of being a good mother. They felt the children were their primary responsibility. The men talked about their fears of being the sole support of a family,'' she says.

 One effect of marrying later is that each partner is likely to have been living independently. Marriage is therefore not merely a merger of two people; it's also the combination of two sets of household effects. Moving two people into one home is far from an effortless endeavor. But you'll accomplish the feat more easily if you plan ahead, make lists _ and learn how to pack and load a truck. According to <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Alencikas </PERSON>, manager of customer services at <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION>, it's wise to start about four weeks ahead of time to organize the details of the move. Even those hiring a mover should make an inventory of what they each have. The list can be used to plan what to get rid of, what new items are needed and finally to estimate the size truck required to move belongings. Those renting a truck should reserve it well in advance. During busy summer weekends, the peak period of demand, a month is not too long. At other times, a week or two is usually sufficient. When making a reservation, be prepared with a list of what you need to move so you can get the right size truck. Rental trucks range in size from a 1O-footer with 295 cubic feet or room for one roomful of belongings to a 24-footer for seven rooms of furnishings. A 15-foot van provides about 750 cubic feet of storage or three to four rooms of furnishings. The majority of moves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are do-it-yourself moves, accordiing to <LOCATION> Alencikas </LOCATION>, primarily because of cost savings. As an example, she says, it might cost about $ 420 to rent a 15-foot van for a one-way move from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, compared to about $ 1,000 based on standard tariffs discounted at 30 percent for the same move via a van line. You'll also be able to rent protective wrapping and hand trucks and to buy bubble pack and cartons from do-it-yourself rental companies, or, of course, you can save money by recycling supermarket boxes and bubble wrap from wedding presents. Two to four weeks ahead of time, make an inventory and start to pack and label possessions; close and open charge and bank accounts; turn utilities on and off, and notify the old and new post offices of your new address. Two weeks before the move, it's time to start packing. On moving day, it's time to start loading the truck. Some tips: Load the truck one-quarter at a time, solid from floor to ceiling. Tie off each quarter with sturdy rope. Do n't leave any open spaces since a tight fit keeps the load from shifting and protects goods from breakage. Fill in spaces with small boxes. Load the heaviest items, such as major appliances, first.

 When <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauthier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> wed last fall in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, her hobby of collecting 1930s and 1940s tableware and vintage tablecloths and napkins occupied center stage. The tables holding the wedding feast were covered with the tablecloths and set with her mixed collection of colorful Depression glass and Fiestaware. The menu consisted mainly of food made by the bride. It was a prime example of couples planning their wedding as a very personal event. <PERSON> Gauthier-Reed </PERSON> says colorful tables are conducive to a festive atmosphere. Though unassuming and not normally for a formal table, the settings were a delightful surprise to guests at her wedding, she says. Gauthier-Reed, a 25-year-old graphic artist, says she learned some of her stylish ways by working as an assistant to <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, the food stylist and author of books on party-giving, including `` Weddings.'' She put <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s lessons on color to use at her own wedding to create a relatively inexpensive event that was nevertheless original. The menu included a salad of thinly-sliced filet of beef and red and yellow peppers, carrots and snow peas in vinaigrette dressing. There was also tortellini salad with pesto, sesame noodles, tomato and red onion salad and broccoli. Table garnishes included a mix of black, purple, red, yellow, green and orange peppers and edible nasturtium flowers. `` We did n't have fancy food, just a simple menu of homemade food. But everyone said it was the most elegant wedding they had gone to. I think the table settings had a lot to do with that. It was a unique way of expressing ourselves,'' she says. So pleased was she with the wedding and the enjoyment she got out of using her rapidly-enlarging collection of dinnerware and tablecloths from the 1930s and early'40s that she decided the experience held the seeds of a new business idea. She has launched a business renting the pieces to others for parties and special occasions. `` Depression glass was the poor person's colored crystal. It was given away as a bonus when people bought their groceries. You could also buy it for about a quarter a place setting,'' she says. Formerly scorned and found in junk shops, Depression glass and other old favorites such as Fiestaware and Fire King dishes now command good prices and are getting harder to find. Though her new business is unusual, it is not unique, she says. She came across the idea in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where it appears to have originated. `` I realized this business could be the perfect solution. I would earn money to support our collecting and, after renting it out, I'd get the whole collection back at the end of the day,'' she says

 With wedding ceremonies as varied as they are these days, walking down the aisle to a different drummer can be a most creative experience. The American Music Conference has some ideas to consider when planning music for the nuptial rites: _ If the wedding is in a religious setting, be sure to check with the clergy or music director to determine what types of music are allowed. _ If a music advisor or wedding planner is not available, talk to friends involved in music, or music students at a local college. _ Resist the temptation to choose musical selections only because you like them; the music should not distract from the ceremony, no matter how beautiful or entertaining. _ If you choose a traditional wedding selection, like <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Bridal Chorus'' or <PERSON> Mendelsohn </PERSON>'s `` Wedding March,'' consider a non-traditional grouping of instruments Guitars, string ensembles or electronic instruments can offer a different approach. _ To personalize the ceremony, ask friends who can sing or play musical instruments well to participate. -LRB- However, if family and friends are n't musical, paying for the performance is worthwhile. -RRB- _ Position musicians and singers near the front and to the side _ where they can be heard but wo n't upstage the wedding couple. _ Keep the music program simple. Experimentation is best left to another time. The American Music Conference is a non-profit organization that encourages participation in amateur music-making.

 For <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, it started out as a hobby, visiting this estate sale and that flea market. `` I was buying and selling pieces primarily as a diversion,'' he says. `` Soon, people were asking me to be on the lookout for particular patterns to replace pieces that had been broken or lost.''

The company buys and sells china and crystal by mail, phone order, and direct purchase. For those who do n't know the name of their china or crystal pattern, Page suggests mailing a photocopy, with notes on colors and markings. Or, for unidentified crystal, wrap a piece of tissue paper around the glass and make a rubbing of any etchings with a soft-lead pencil, he says. Then sketch the crystal's stem.

The announcement prompted outrage from workers and government officials, who said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> pledged to continue making cars in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for five years when the company bought the plant from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. The union filed a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> but withdrew it amid negotiations over the shutdown. Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> also threatened to sue but eventually accepted a multimillion-dollar settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials said they may have been guilty of over-optimism in stating that car production would continue, but insisted they made no promises. Car production ends officially on Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will continue to employ about 1,000 of the most senior workers for engine assembly. Many of those losing their jobs said they will have to settle for lower-paying and less stable work. Some already have been laid off. `` I'm 36 and everything has been pulled out from under me,'' said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Strecker </PERSON>, who has worked at the plant for 16 years. `` But I'll survive. Most of us will.'' <PERSON> Strecker </PERSON> sold her home in October to get money in case she needs to move. She's also among 2,200 senior employees who will receive full pay until a $ 20 million job bank provided by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> as part of the settlement with the union is depleted. With unemployment compensation, <PERSON> Strecker </PERSON> figures she should keep receiving some income for six months. `` By that time, I'll have my head together enough,'' she said, adding that she hopes to take classes so she can start a business. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucks </PERSON>, who started working at the plant in 1979, signed papers with her husband on a $ 20,000 car Jan. 27, the same day <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced its pullout. The couple had felt secure because of their combined incomes. But the announcement halted their plans to buy a new home and have children. `` It's almost like the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream is slipping through our fingers,'' Tucks said. `` I am still very bitter at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. `` It was the fact that they pumped everyone's hopes up. People went out and bought homes and cars.'' Amid the bitter feelings toward <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, a network of state, local and company initiatives has emerged to soften the blow. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has diverted profits from 1988 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> car sales into a trust fund _ estimated at $ 24 million _ to help workers and their families meet housing and education costs. As part of the settlement with the state, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is providing an executive to assist southeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> communities in attracting jobs. An assistance center at the local <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> headquarters is offering help with employment searches, job training and basic education. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, 41, hopes to get work repairing engines after he finishes job training. `` To go from $ 14 an hour to around $ 8 an hour is a big drop,'' he said. `` But you have to figure $ 8 an hour is better than nothing.''

 Stock prices fell slightly in light trading at midday Monday, as investors began to turn their attention toward the upcoming holidays and Friday's release of British trade figures for November. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 0.3 point, or 0.02 percent, at 1,773.4 around 12:30 p.m. local time, below its early morning peak of 1,779.0. Volume was a light 192.5 million shares, compared with 235.8 million shares at the same time Friday. `` It certainly feels a lot like Christmas week,'' one trader said. `` We've seen modest waves of interest throughout the morning but absolutely no follow-through.'' Dealers said the Friday release of the British trade report likely would keep players anxious and sidelined during the coming week.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said one of its goals for 1989 is to pare down its current account surplus to $ 9.5 billion from this year's projected $ 13.8 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its economic management plan Monday that the proposed reduction would be achieved partly through more liberal import regulations. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has pledged to further open its markets to foreigners to avoid trade friction from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries that have trade deficits with the nation. The planning board predicted that imports will rise about 24 percent next year to $ 65 billion, while exports will increase about 17 percent to $ 70 billion. The board also predicted the economy would grow by about 8 percent next year, compared with the 12.1 percent forcasted for this year. It attributed the decline to the anticipated slowdown in exports.

 Despite large November increases for gasoline and heating oil, the government says wholesale prices continue to rise at an annual rate of less than 4 percent, confounding predictions of a mounting inflation problem. Wholesale prices edged up just 0.3 percent in November as food costs at the wholesale level showed no increases for the second straight month, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The November increase, if it persisted for 12 months, would amount to an annual inflation rate of just 3.3 percent, lower than the 3.8 percent annualized rate for the first 11 months of 1987.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs increased by eight to total 930 this week, marking the second consecutive week the rig count has posted a gain, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Last week the count increased by 17 to 922. A year ago the count was 1,168, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said.

The takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> is the latest in a wave of mergers and recapitalizations that have swept through the foods industry in recent years.

 It was a year that gave corporate debt a frightening new dimension, a year in which everything from car rentals to cheerleader outfits, TV Guide to <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, plumbing supplies to paper towels, all somehow were affected by a megabillion-dollar runup in borrowing. Within a few months of the worst stock market debacle in modern times, American companies scrambled as never before to merge, spin off, sell out, pare down and restructure _ all in the name of efficiency, growth, competitiveness and long-term survival. The orgy of dealmaking, reminiscent of the 1920s corporate borrowing binge that preceded the Great Depression, has raised disturbing questions about the direction <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business will take as it struggles to meet the mortgage. Since 1982, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have doubled their debt to nearly $ 2 trillion. An estimated 25 percent of their cash flow is used to service debt, money that theoretically could be used for investing in research, training or expansion. In 1988 alone, the dollar amount of mergers and acquisitions financed largely with borrowed money totaled more than $ 200 billion, enough to wipe out the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and erase a good chunk of Third World debt. Many economists are concerned about what will happen if highly indebted companies someday can not pay the interest they owe. They say stores will shut, factories will close, tax revenues will tumble, unemployment will soar. Some fear that the billions of dollars in investment needed to keep American companies competitive could be sacrificed to pay debt, giving foreign economic rivals such as the Japanese even more of an edge. Others say bankers, insurers and pension funds that loaned the money for takeovers will wind up holding securities that could sell for 50 cents or less on the dollar _ a domestic version of the Third World debt disaster. `` I must admit I view with alarm what's going on now,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based consulting firm. `` These increased debt levels, if we go into recession, would be quite worrisome.'' The rising corporate debt already is rippling through the economy in troubling ways, such as higher interest rates, increased bankruptcies, layoffs and greater use of cheap part-time and temporary workers to cut costs. Those 30 percent discount Christmas sales at <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s have n't been meant to raise holiday cheer: The owners of these stores need quick cash to service the enormous debt loads of their restructured companies. When the diversified manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced it was closing two <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> shoe factories in early December, a huge debt restructuring to thwart a hostile takeover was to blame. When workers of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> asked the government earlier this year to review whether the owners run safe operations, they said high debt in those carriers were hurting maintenance and preventing investment in new planes. Both airlines were bought on borrowed money. Last July, the Revco D.S. drug chain became the first big debt-financed takeover company to seek bankruptcy protection from creditors. While it generates $ 100 million in cash a year, that's nowhere near enough to service more than $ 1 billion in debt `` It's our feeling that with the amount of money raised in the buyout market in the last several years, the amount of deals done, and the levels done, you're going to see a substantially greater amount of defaulted and bankrupt companies coming out,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, chief executive officer of R.D. <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm that trades in distressed companies' bonds. Just in the last few months, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says, the volume of distressed bonds has equaled the total he'd seen in more than than three years, and `` if you start to have a recessionary period, there's going to be a ton of them.'' The concern about corporate debt and its broader impact is n't limited to economists, labor unions and bond traders Even some of the most aggressive promoters and beneficiaries of debt-financed takeovers have expressed concern about whether the dealmaking has gone too far. `` Today's financial age has become a period of unbridled excess with accepted risk soaring out of proportion to possible reward,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> takeover firm <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Every week, with ever-increasing levels of irresponsibility, many billions of dollars in American assets are being saddled with debt that has virtually no chance of being repaid.'' Even as concern rises about the implications of rising corporate debt, more managers are lining up lenders to help buy their companies or prevent outsiders from doing so. A recent study by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> finance professor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsetsekos </PERSON> suggested that among companies that bought back their own stock to boost share values after the October 1987 crash, one in four was increasing debt levels, partly as an antitakeover move. Bank lenders, historically burned by bad real estate and Latin American loans, have n't expressed much reticence about the latest borrowing wave either, despite a blunt warning by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> to carefully evaluate their takeover-loan portfolios. A <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> survey earlier this year suggested that 15 percent of commercial and industrial loans were related to mergers, and at some big banks the figure was as high as 40 percent. One of the key catalysts in this new avalanche of debt is the takeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or LBO, in which a buyer with practically no money can purchase a company using its assets as collateral for loans, sell pieces of the company to repay those loans and make a profit in the process. The result has often been a trimmed-down and highly efficient private company liberated from the obligation of paying quarterly dividends to shareholders and able to concentrate on its business. But it may also result in so much indebtedness that management becomes preoccupied with paying it back.

 The leveraged buyout has been extolled, denounced and intensely debated. It has brought out both the best in management skill, the worst in Wall Street greed and the concern of lawmakers. `` There's something seriously wrong when there's more of an incentive for corporate managers to liquidate their own companies for their own personal financial benefit than there is an incentive for them to make the company more competitive,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., one of several legislators expected to conduct hearings into leveraged buyouts in 1989 Ironically, most ordinary American families probably do n't even notice how increased corporate debt is part of their daily routine. Like an invisible gas, the leveraging of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies is subtle, silent, gradual, everywhere. If they shop at <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>, read TV Guide, rent a car from <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION>, buy <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> paper towels, shave with a <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, order Goodyear radials for the car or install an American Standard bathtub, some of their spending money goes to pay down an enormously increased corporate debt. That's only a result of some of the biggest deals. The vast majority of debt-financed restructurings affects smaller companies rarely mentioned in the news but just as much a part of everyday American life. For example, cheerleader uniforms supplied to most schools come from <ORGANIZATION> Cheerleader </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company formed from a $ 46 million LBO engineered last June. Ten Midwest states use fire hydrants supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which underwent a $ 20 million management-led debt restructuring in December. Despite the growing clamor about where all this debt is leading, there are passionate defenders of LBOs who say the concept of debt is widely misunderstood. In their view, debt is a tool, a way to exploit money to maximum advantage, and should not be viewed as a threat. `` One of the biggest missing ingredients in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> right now is information and understanding about LBOs,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a small but powerful investment firm that is the undisputed leader of the technique. `` We're not going to take the heart out of a corporation,'' he told Fortune magazine in an interview. `` People who produce things will stay. We look at the people who report to people who report to people. We'll often cut fat at the corporate level. `` There'd be much less of this, and companies would be valued more accurately, if chief executives felt the pressure from their directors to do the cutting that they only do when they're threatened by a takeover. To a large degree, it was <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>'s firm that heightened the controversy over debt-financed takeovers. Its biggest triumph so far is the record $ 24.5 billion purchase of food-tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, announced Nov. 30 after a bidding brawl that some considered a symbol of corporate gluttony. Many will be watching closely to see how <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> manages or even survives under a quadrupled debt load of $ 23 billion. Some forecasters believe <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON>'s triumph also could become its greatest defeat and help sour corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s appetite for borrowed money. `` The Revco D.S. bankruptcy was a warning,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON>, president of the Philadelphia-based business information firm <ORGANIZATION> MLR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in the December issue of Corporate Restructuring, an industry newsletter. `` The <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal may lead us closer to the brink.''

 The takeover wave that swept across the corporate landscape in 1988 established new high-water marks for dealmakers and obliterated the notion that some companies are invulnerable to attack. `` A lot of companies thought they were safe because they were too large,'' said portfolio manager <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. But after the megadeals reached in 1988 _ capped by the proposed record $ 24.5 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ managers realized `` there is no such thing as being too big to be taken over,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, professor of finance and law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>. Take the case of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who began the year as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> but left the publishing and information services giant now owned by a British concern after one of the year's most bruising takeover struggles. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> had been given good marks by financial analysts for improving the profitability of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> since taking over in 1980. The stock market showed its appreciation by pushing the company's stock price up more than 12-fold during his tenure But it was n't nearly enough The day before <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s annual shareholders meeting last May, a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Texan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> proposed a buyout at $ 64 a share, a 26 percent premium over the company's closing price that day. Six months later, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was gone and the company was no longer independent despite deploying an arsenal of takeover defenses _ a restructuring, hefty severance agreements for top executives, a poison pill to deter hostile bidders and the assistance of a friendly suitor. Company management recruited the acknowledged leader in the leveraged buyout business in an effort to acquire the company itself and was twice declared the winner in the bidding. But <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> ultimately lost to a persistent rival from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who tripped him up in the courts and won the company by simply offering more cash. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s president who was allied with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> but has stayed on after the acquisition by publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, says the defense strategy was like putting `` just a little more glass on the bathroom floor.'' It failed, he said, because `` nothing stops an all-cash offer.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikora </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Acquisitions magazine in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the value of takeover deals in 1988 may shatter the record of nearly $ 205 billion set two years ago even though the number of deals was down 16 percent through October from a year ago. He credits the growing presence of buyout funds _ set up specifically to reap huge returns by buying an undervalued company and either running it better or selling it in parts _ for driving the stakes in the takeover wars higher. `` It has created competition for deals,'' he said. <PERSON> Sikora </PERSON> estimates there is $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion invested in such funds that could be used to borrow up to $ 300 billion for takeovers. <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said the huge amount of money expressly earmarked for takeovers has enabled dealmakers to start considering the larger companies as targets rather than simply the medium-sized companies previously scrutinized. `` That's a lot better for me because the deepest discounts in terms of market price versus private value is often in the big capitalized stocks,'' <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Linneman </PERSON>, professor of finance in public policy at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, said recent dealmaking shows how management's focus has shifted from running the company well to getting returns for the shareholder. `` In the old days, management said it was its objective to generate cash flow, and if the market does n't see it, so be it ... But what management has realized is, right or wrong, if the market does n't accurately reflect value, someone will come in who will,'' he said. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said he thinks the trend toward bigger deals should continue, especially as foreign companies enter the fray more heavily. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said the trend may depend on how the courts ultimately view the growing efforts by various states to enact laws giving corporate managements a veto over hostile takeovers. <PERSON> Linneman </PERSON> from <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON> said he doubts that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will amend the tax laws to limit the deductibility of interest on money borrowed for takeovers. `` You have corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on both sides of each issue,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Minter </PERSON>, a partner in the investment advisory firm <ORGANIZATION> Comstock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, said the debt-financed buyout craze may turn out to be a costly fad, like lending to the oil industry was in the 1970s. `` We see where the banks are lending their money, and stay away from those areas,'' he said. `` There will be some deal that comes along to break their backs.''

 Like the stock market crash of 1987, the Great American Borrowing Binge of 1988 holds the potential for economic disaster. But unlike the one-time shock of collapsing stock values _ which the economy proved resilient enough to overcome _ the unprecedented accumulation of debt threatens long-term indigestion. The economy's course is impossible to predict, of course. No one knew when the current expansion began in 1982 that it would still be going six years later, a peacetime record. The next recession may turn out to be just a brief, mild slump. But some economists believe debt has made the economy so fragile, the next time it falls, it may break rather than bend. `` What you have to worry about in all these things is whether there's a serious threat of bank trouble,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindleberger </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> economist. The crash of 1987 took the mania out of the stock market, but now `` leveraged buyouts seem to have picked up in a manic way,'' said <PERSON> Kindleberger </PERSON>, author of a 1978 book, `` Manias, Panics and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises.'' Leverage is a concept Americans grasp young, when they first notice that one child at the long end of a seesaw can hold up two on the short end. A loan likewise expands a person's or company's financial potential But seesaws can suddenly tip the other way, and so can loans. Some corporate debtors may be gambling that they will be protected from the consequences of their actions by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, which would open the money spigots in a recession to keep them from defaulting. The problem is that easy money, while good for LBO artists, means high inflation for everybody else. So far there is no sign that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going easy on the money supply. In fact, it has tightened, because the economy is growing strongly. The acid test will be the next downturn. Here are the flash points: _ Corporations are loading up on debt to finance takeovers, to escape takeovers, or simply to take advantage of the tax deductibility of interest payments In the mid-1970s, corporations had $ 5 of pretax profit for each dollar of interest they paid. Now they scrape by with $ 2. _ Banks are lending money for leveraged buyouts and commercial real estate the same way they once lent liberally to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Things are already shaky. Although 1988 will be a record year for bank profits, it will also set a record for bank failures. _ Business is not alone in the debt pileup Families are borrowing to make up for the stagnation in wages and salaries that began in the 1970s, and household debt is at record levels. What makes leveraged buyouts a particular concern is that borrowers admit in many cases that the only way they can pay off their loans is by selling off assets. The question is, to whom? The crash of 1987 proved to stock investors that buyers, like taxi cabs in the rain, become scarce just when you need them most. Buyers may be just as scarce when the economy slumps and indebted companies desperately need to sell assets to pay interest. Even aside from LBOs, corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has become so attracted to debt that a AAA bond rating is almost an embarrassment in some circles _ a sign to some that a company is not sufficiently aggressive. It is true that companies in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are more heavily indebted than American companies. But banking companies in those countries directly or indirectly own big stakes in the borrowers so they make sure they will not fail. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, banks and bondholders are less sympathetic. Using a computer simulation, the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> calculated that one big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporation in 10 would run out of cash by the end of the second year of a recession as bad as the last one. `` We are going to go into the next recession with basically half the interest coverage we had prior to the 1980-82 downturn. We'd have to expect that there are going to be more corporate defaults,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The great danger is the following: When a company finds itself in a position where it has become difficult to satisfy its interest obligations, it has to come up with cash to stave off bankruptcy It does it by laying off workers, reducing operations. `` But if many companies are forced to do this, what will then happen is the recession will become all the more intense. That is the great worry that all <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers face when they go ahead and tighten the money supply,'' <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON> said. Other economists say the debt danger can be overdrawn. It is not clear that raising money by issuing debt endangers the economy more than raising money by selling stock, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Any recession that is so bad that it triggers a cascade of defaults `` is already so deep that everybody's pretty much wiped out anyway,'' <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON> said. Still, economists agree that reversing the long decline in the national rate of savings would put the economy on a sounder footing. Ironically, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s success in wringing inflation out of the economy in the 1980s raised debt burdens by setting off an explosion of distress borrowing. Consumers, businesses and the government took on new debt to service the old. Federal spending, which is often fingered as a culprit in the American debt binge, may be getting more than its fair share of criticism. The federal budget deficit is actually shrinking as a portion of economic output and is smaller proportionately than in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. If Americans saved more, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a whole _ government, corporations and individuals _ would not need to borrow so heavily from overseas. The trade deficit would fall and foreigners would not be able to buy up as many American factories and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills. As 1989 begins, there are some reasons to think the debt binge may be dampened soon. In the coming session, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will consider removing the tax advantages of loading up on corporate debt by eliminating the deductibility of some portion of junk bond interest payments. Federal regulators may press banks that make risky LBO loans to build their loan-loss reserves or raise their capital above required minimums. Aside from government action, the markets themselves are beginning to put a lid on leveraged buyouts by shying away from the riskiest corporate bond issues. In contrast to other debt crises, the credit risk of merger mania is getting plenty of publicity. And that may be the best thing for it.

 The buyout binge on Wall Street played a major role in putting the stock market averages in the plus column for 1988. But many observers worry that the participants in this frenzy racked up short-term gains at the expense of potential long-term pain in the marketplace. In early December, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON>, an analyst at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Tucker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R.L. <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, calculated that takeover activity directly accounted for nearly a third of the overall increase recorded by one widely followed measure of stock prices. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks showed a 12.91 percent rise since the beginning of the year. Of that, <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> reckoned, 3.7 percentage points stemmed from `` takeover stocks.'' Harder to quantify was the amount of the overall increase that stemmed from buying in `` non-takeover'' stocks based on the expectation, or hope, that the companies in question might someday be bought out at higher prices. In fact, the takeover game has prompted a significant change in the way many stock traders and analysts evaluate stocks for their profit potential. Instead of looking at a company's business prospects or its chances for earnings and dividend growth, the new way of gauging value is to try to calculate what a stock might fetch if it were to become a takeover target. Takeover specialists and their advocates say they are acting in favor of all holders of the stocks that get `` put in play.'' After all, they say, when a stock gets caught up in a bidding war, everybody who owns it gets the benefit of the increase in its price, along with the raiders and professional traders known as arbitrage who generate most of the activity. If anybody has a complaint about this bidding, they argue, it should n't be people who have a stake in higher stock prices. But the many skeptics and critics who have watched as the stakes of the game reached new heights say it almost inevitably will lead to trouble. If something comes along to curtail or stop the action, such as legislation to discourage it, an important prop under the stock market will be removed. And if the mania keeps up, they contend, it can only increase the dangers of exessive debt and speculative risk. With the burgeoning bundle of money and credit being amassed in buyout funds, `` the result is bound to be too much money chasing too few good deals,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in his Boston-based investment advisory publication The Turnaround Letter. `` In many ways a leveraged buyout is like buying stock on margin'' _ in other words, with only a partial down payment, <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> added. `` However, in an LBO you can borrow 90 percent of the purchase price, instead of 50 percent when you buy stock on margin. `` The last time you could buy stock by borrowing 90 percent of the purchase price was 1929. Need we say more?'' Analysts at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> say, `` restructuring activity should extend into 1989, limiting downside risk in the market but also continuing to alienate traditional investors. `` At present, there is essentially only one buyer of stocks: The corporate insider. `` Companies that acquire their own stock or the shares of other companies, nonmanagement groups that prepare leveraged buyouts and raiders all possess ` inside information' of the legal variety. They have more knowledge than does a seller by virtue of who they are. `` By contrast, traditional investors, both domestic and foreign, are highly skeptical about the process of restructuring companies and the increased commoditization of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equities. These investors have therefore retreated from the market.'' Detractors of the buyout wave tend not to mince words. Among the ingredients in what he calls a `` recipe for disaster'' in the market, <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, investment adviser <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLoggia </PERSON> cites `` investment bankers who are leveraging corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the hilt at monstrous interest rates at the height of the economic cycle for no reason other than the fact these transactions generate huge fees.'' And buyouts by management have drawn some especially pointed objections. `` The public has always felt that the market was dominated by the big players, and program trading reinforced that view,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The public has always suspected that the market was manipulated by insiders, and the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, et al., scandals confirmed that view. `` Now the public finds that you ca n't even trust the highly paid management of your company to act in the stockholder's interests.''

 Corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s reliance on borrowed money was never more prevalent than in 1988, when a flood of takeover activity was unleashed. Businesses swallowed each other up with a vengeance, regardless of size; and those that tried to resist were forced to make drastic structural changes. To finance these acquisitions, leveraged buyouts or restructurings many firms turned to the $ 180 billion public `` junk'' bond market _ where companies whose credit ratings are below investment grade offer high interest rates to compensate for bigger risks. Once a last resort in public financing, junk bonds played a pivotal role in the wave of takeovers this past year and have gained wider acceptance, and perhaps even more respect in the eyes of investors and corporate executives. `` As more and more companies use high-yield debt to finance their growth ... it becomes a regular alternative in terms of raising capital,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waill </PERSON>, managing director for high-yield research at <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's almost commonplace.'' But all that has come at the expense of the high-grade corporate market, which includes the elite 5 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies with investment-grade ratings, the nation's bread-and-butter manufacturers. Fears of large corporate takeovers, and even bigger debt loads, scared many investors away from bonds of indust ~ companies this past year Non-investment-grade companies are drawn to the junk bond market's seemingly endless supply of funds, especially since it has enabled them to offer a price high enough to persuade a target company's shareholders to sell. Tax laws also have made junk bond financing attractive by allowing interest payments to be deducted as a cost of doing business. Companies that raise money through issuing new stock ca n't do the same with stock dividends And it costs less to borrow from the public than banks, even though junk bond yields are usually around four percentage points higher than comparable <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. As of mid-December there were 148 public junk bond issues valued at $ 27.17 billion, 56 percent of which were used primarily for financing LBOs or acquisitions, according to the independent financial-research firm <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Just three years ago, about 27 percent of the $ 13.19 billion in junk bond issues were used toward acquisitions, it said Bond investors and traders are bracing for a deluge of big issues in 1989, largely as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s record $ 24.5 billion buyout of consumer products giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> While the bulk of the financing, $ 14 billion, will come from a commercial bank syndicate, $ 5 billion will be through junk bonds. Another $ 5 billion of existing <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> bonds is certain to be downgraded to junk since the enormous debt load will make it harder for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> to pay off previous debts, therefore increasing the risk factor. It was that deal and other megadeals and proposals _ including <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 12.9 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ that sent the industrial bond market into a frenzy this past year. Bond prices plummeted and trading came to a virtual standstill on fears that any company, regardless of size, could become a takeover target or aggressor, and in the process load itself up with new debt. The so-called `` event risk'' fears consequently have hurt supplies. In November alone domestic industrial corporations sold only two new bond issues in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, totaling about $ 250 million. That was down sharply from six bond issues totaling $ 1 billion the previous month. While investors suffered some losses on industrial bonds, they've seen their rate of return on junk go up <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> B. Front, who manages mutual funds for the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farnham </ORGANIZATION>, said the high-yield bond portfolio has a rate of return of 11.25 percent, compared with 7.2 percent for the investment-grade bond portfolio and 17 percent for equities. `` The interest rates are very high and to some extent high-yield paper represents less volatile surrogates to equities,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Although mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds hold most of the outstanding junk bond issues, around 70 percent, foreign interest has increased significantly. Foreign market share now totals around 3 percent, compared to just a small fraction a few years ago, according to a General Accounting report released in February and analysts. The last six years of economic expansion have been a boon to the junk market by helping to keep defaults down, but many portfolio managers worry that an economic turndown will reverse that trend. `` We're concerned that the junk bond default rate has not been tested in recent conditions and therefore we're not certain that the total returns from junk are what they appear to be,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 65 billion investment portfolio includes only $ 200 million of junk bonds

 The takeover class of'88 is a diverse, feisty group that includes specialized investment firms, media moguls and a casino czar. Its valedictorian is premier leveraged-buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which pulled off the coup of the year in late November: the mammoth $ 24.5 billion leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That deal eclipsed all previous corporate takeovers Here are the top members of the class: _ MOST AGGRESSIVE: <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, taking top honors for the <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> deal after a battle royal against the company's management and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> Earlier in the year, <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> continued its acquisitive efforts at an unrelenting pace with LBOs of battery maker <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.8 billion and grocery chain <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.2 billion. Principal <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> says he lost eight pounds in five weeks from sweating out the Nabisco negotiations. He must have passed up the Oreos. _ GREATEST CHUTZPAH: <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which he took private in early September Undaunted by the failure of his earlier $ 14.5 billion offer for oil giant <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the wily corporate raider disclosed Dec. 13 that he had increased his stock ownership to 15.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares. The disclosure by <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, stoked the smoldering takeover speculation about the company and boosted its stock price. _ MOST PERSUASIVE: <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, masters of `` strategic block'' investing The trio has bought into huge companies like <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- now called <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and amassed a hoard of cash, instead of walking away with the companies themselves.

They're really persuaders: It's the promise of a handsome return, which has averaged more than 35 percent a year, that attracts people willing to invest $ 5 million each to join their funds. _ MOST COSMOPOLITAN: <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, who became an American raider in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> this year With profitable runs on major companies like <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> under his belt, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> has transplanted part of his investment business to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

The Aussie-turned-U.S.-citizen also broadened his empire during the year by creating joint ventures with <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a group of big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hotel chains. _ MOST PERSISTENT: British publishing tycoon <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, the other media member of the class, who tried and tried again to buy <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The intrepid <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> finally succeeded on the third try, getting the venerable publishing and information services giant for $ 2.5 billion in early November.

 If a time machine could transport the leveraged buyout artists of 1988 back to the 19th century, those in arrears might be clanging chains in debtors' prison, denounced as dangerous for selling pieces of paper called `` junk bonds'' that promise rewarding returns. The comparison shows how the treatment of debt and its consequences have changed so profoundly just in a short span of Western history, economists and bankruptcy experts say. Once seen as a symbol of shame, scandal, weakness and failure, owing money has been transmuted into status, confidence and power. `` A company taking on debt is now considered evidence that it's strong,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervin </PERSON>, a bankruptcy lawyer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Rosenman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Colin `` It's like a person taking on a credit line. That's something you flex your muscles about. You feel good about it.'' The modern-day attitude toward debt is even more startling when compared with the practices of ancient <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where creditors had the legal right to cut debtors' bodies into pieces. `` Back in the old, old days, if you were a king or an emperor or some high potentate, you could borrow and if you could n't pay it back you'd chop the head off the lender,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavesh </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you were an individual and you could n't pay it back, you'd be a slave of sorts.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> articulated <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s taboo toward borrowed money with the line in Hamlet, `` Neither a borrower nor lender be, for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.'' `` In other words,'' <PERSON> Kavesh </PERSON> says, `` stay out of debt.'' A couple of hundred years ago, defaulting even on a petty debt could land an English citizen, farmer or shopkeeper in a state dungeon or on a boat to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, a one-time penal colony where many debtors were exiled. Up until the late 18th and early 19th centuries, creditors in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> had extraordinary control over debtors' lives, with the right to deprive them of their liberty until the debt was repaid. Historical accounts show that by the early 1800s there were eight debtors' prisons in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> alone, with inmate populations ranging in size from less than a dozen to 600. Most prisons were squalid, filled with vermin and disease. Debtors' prisons also were an important part of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. What is now the state of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was originally a debtors colony, inhabited by violators of the so-called insolvent laws. Records on file at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> show that in 1816, nearly 2,000 people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state were incarcerated for delinquent debts, more than half of them under $ 50 each. Debtors' prisons eventually were abolished, a partial result of an industrialized society, the development of a rational banking system and the evolution of bankruptcy laws. But there are interesting relics of that era still on the books today, bankruptcy lawyers say. For example, some state statutes enable creditors to seize property of debtors without a court proceeding. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, a legal provision called a concession of judgment allows a creditor to obtain a default judgment even if there's no default. `` That's certainly a right that goes back to the days of debtors' prison,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, a creditors' rights attorney at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Dechert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> Others say the symbolic burning of a mortgage is a throwback to the days when the yoke of debt could be joyfully discarded, the shame of owing money forgotten. But even that rite has changed in the era of borrowing to the hilt. `` Nowadays, what you find is the burning of the mortgage, instead of liberation, is an invitation to refinance again,'' said <PERSON> Kavesh </PERSON>. `` It's an amazing turnabout.'' On a larger scale, Wall Street giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> pride themselves on their ability to aggressively borrow billions of dollars for takeovers through the sale of high-yield `` junk bond'' debt securities. It remains to be seen how much of this debt will be repaid, though, since most junk-bond issues have n't matured yet. `` For 2,000 years, debt was condemned by philosophers,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, editor of <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s Interest Rate Observer and a prominent critic of the 1988 debt-financed takeover binge. `` Suddenly it's not only a stigma, but according to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>, you're an idiot if you're not in debt.''

<HEAD>The Numbers Are Clear, But Impact of Merger Mania Isn't</HEAD>

 By the numbers, the news about leveraged buyouts and takeovers seems clear, precise and exact to the decimal points. In a numerical sense the news is clear; does n't everyone understand dollars and cents? True, perhaps, but when did numbers ever tell the entire story? In the wake of these corporate convulsions, the business scene is strewn with questions about ethics and responsibilities, about the proper use of borrowed money, of the role of banks, of the future of `` junk'' bonds. So vast are the considerations that they begin with the ultimate naivete: What's happening? In the past five years $ 375 billion of corporate equities have been removed from markets. In the same period, the long-term debt of non-financial companies has about doubled to around $ 2 trillion. Much of this debt is of unknown quality. That is, the repayment ability of those raising the debt is unproven. If borrowers renege, it will have a severe impact on some of the big lenders, such as banks and private pension funds. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> brings up another consideration. He sees mounting private debt, particularly corporate debt arising from takeover activity, as limiting the government's options in managing the economy <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is concerned too, and it should be, since leveraged buyouts are subsidized by taxpayers. That is, the interest payments on such debt are tax deductible. Should Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> continue to provide such an incentive? Have bondholders, whose investments fell sharply, been abused? The courts will see to that, because some institutional buyers of corporate bonds, such as pension funds insurance companies, are suing. They say they were n't told of management's plan to cheapen existing bonds with new debt. But where do those with less clearcut rights turn? What, for instance, are the rights of employees whose company is purchased so that it can be broken up, sold off, its local jobs eliminated and its productive years ended? Does n't the larger community have rights? Should it sit by idly while a once viable division is removed from the tax rolls after the town committed itself to new storm and sanitary sewers based on the division's healthy future? So serious are the potential consequences of buying, selling and sometimes dismembering entire companies, that it seems inevitable that even more basic considerations will arise, such as the very definition of a corporation. While such fundamental issues caused concern, few were fully explored or in most instances even addressed in the chaotic year of mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and takeovers. While the entire business of buying and selling companies creates these issues, they were especially acute in regard to the officers and directors of companies in which insiders sought control through leveraged buyouts. It might seem a safe assumption that nobody should know more about a company, including its real value, than those whose job it is to run it. If you accept that assumption, however, you are confronted with a puzzle. You must, for example, make sense of the attempted management takeover of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 75 a share or $ 17.6 billion. That is what management offered, and it was widely heralded as a bonanza for shareholders. Quickly, however, a competing offer came from outsiders at $ 90 a share, or close to $ 21 billion. It meant, in effect, that management's offer was far less than the best. Left on the table, so to speak, were funds equal to the assets of such well known large companies as <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION>, Firestone or Inland Steel. The bidding did not stop there, however. It continued until it exceeded $ 24 billion before management's own board of directors, fulfilling its obligation to protect shareholders, agreed to an outside group's offer. Had shareholders accepted management's first offer they would have made perhaps the worst deal in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business history. Thankful they had n't accepted the low-ball offer from <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management, many of these shareholders, along with civic-minded individuals and institutions, remain concerned about what could have been. Unlike the matter of existing bondholders, who felt they had a clear-cut case for the courts, many of these issues seem to fall into a judicial and regulatory no-man's land that might require years to deal with. Are activities of corporate management covered by insider trading laws? Should they? Who possibly could be more privy to inside information than the managers of a company? Possessing it, did they use it for their own benefit? In the past two years a number of insider cases, instances in which nonpublic information was used for private financial gain, have been prosecuted. In most instances, the numbers involved `` only'' millions, but in leveraged buyouts the numbers are well up in the billions of dollars. If the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s insider trading regulations are applied to leveraged buyouts the consequences could make these other insider cases appear piddling. Question: Do immediate disclosure regulations apply in leveraged buyouts? Should they? Consider that in matters involving a potential change in the price of a stock, management is obligated to disclose information immediately. Clearly, leveraged buyouts, which always affect prices, are n't disclosed immediately. Another nagging question that could become an issue is this: What assurance do shareholders have that managers in a leveraged buyout have n't depressed operations, knowing that improvements can be made later? Of all questions generated by the leveraged buyout binge, one _ more than any other _ seems likely to be answered on the same dollars-and-cents terms in which the deals were originally proposed. It concerns the junk bonds. So-called because they symbolize a very high degree of leveraging, and therefore are theoretically more risky than well-rated bonds, junk bonds face their first general test in the next recession, whenever that comes. The question: Will the highly leveraged corporations that issued junk bonds be able to sustain payments on these bonds if corporate income is reduced because of a general recession? Or will these fantastic buyouts become incredible failures that spread financial ruin?

 Employees at a government-owned uranium-processing plant returned to work today for the first time since a 10-week strike halted production of a material critical to nuclear weapons. About 400 workers were asked to report at 8 a.m. after union members voted by a 3-1 ratio Saturday to approve a partial contract settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which operates the plant 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Workers were taken by bus to a movie theater to attend seminars to teach them how to handle, among other things, leaks of low-level radioactive materials, said plant spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. He said production would resume after the seminars, probably in several days. `` They have to go through a daylong orientation meeting for retraining and safety,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` We have had some problems with radioactive materials outside their containment,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, another plant spokesman. The seminars were scheduled to satisfy workers' complaints about safety at the plant, <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. The key issues in the strike, however, were fringe benefits and retirement programs. The plant, formally known as the Feed Materials Production Center, is the only one of 17 federal nuclear weapons facilities that processes uranium other plants use. Uranium supplies have been partly depleted since the strike began Oct. 7, <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. During the strike, 250 <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> workers received layoff notices as a result of diminished production demands. The plant also became embroiled in controversy when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> admitted that radioactive material had leaked into the environment during the plant's three decades of operation. The department has pledged to clean up the plant, although recent reports indicate the department is considering closing it. Westinghouse Materials President <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> estimated a full cleanup would take nine to 15 years. `` I think you could walk on it without rubber shoe covers, without putting on a smock and worrying about touching things,'' <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Sunday. `` But I'll be long dead and gone before the need to keep monitoring the site is over.'' Residents near the plant recently filed a $ 300 million federal class-action lawsuit claiming radioactive waste emitted by <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> has harmed their health and property. The lawsuit names the plant's previous operator, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, as defendants. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, which took over the plant's operation Jan. 1., 1986, is not named as a defendant The labor agreement, approved by members of 14 unions represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, provides for no pay increase, but allows the approximately 400 workers who were not laid off to return to work and pursue up to 4,000 safety and health grievances. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> had offered to pay workers $ 150 each to drop their grievances. The agreement also provides for $ 1,600 to be paid to each worker during the three-year life of the contract; a new health insurance program; and the right of the unions to review, but not reject, the hiring of subcontractors at the plant.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials received some of the $ 7.75 million the company paid to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> in 1984 in a failed attempt to obtain a jet fighter contract, a newspaper reported today. It is unclear which <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> executives are under investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. However, a grand jury earlier this year subpoenaed <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, as well as four former <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> executives who left the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> aerospace company following disclosures about a Korean hotel deal to be funded by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> The Times, citing unidentified sources, also reported that a <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> consultant, once paid to introduce company officials to Korean leaders, may have received as much as $ 1 million of the payments. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, authorities today arrested a South Korean businessman and charged him with taking $ 3.5 million in bribes from <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> to promote the sale of the F-20 Tigershark fighter planes. The businessman, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Min-ha </PERSON>, allegedly collaborated with a former Korean presidential bodyguard, <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-kyu </PERSON>, who acted as an agent for <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> in trying to sell 200 F-20s to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, prosecutors said. Park, a relative of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, died in 1985. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON>, a spokesman for Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on the reports of broadened grand jury and <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> investigations. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has begun its own investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 payments to the <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, apparently to determine whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> recipients of the money properly reported the income, the Times said. The federal grand jury here is investigating whether <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> violated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making with various payments to at least three organizations controlled by Korean political operator <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyu </PERSON>. The act bars <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies from making direct or indirect payments to foreign government officials. Most of the payments apparently were made to build a hotel in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> as an indirect way to help the Korean government finance purchases of the F-20 fighters, the Times said. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has said it invested in the hotel venture as part of a legal `` offset'' agreement to demonstrate that in return for the jet contract, the company was willing to help boost the Korean economy. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> also funded two other South Korean groups controlled by Park, the <ORGANIZATION> Dong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and Bankaborrow, which apparently were involved to help sell and finance the F-20, the newspaper reported. But the aerospace firm never sold any of the fighters, the hotel never was built and the money is unaccounted for. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has filed a civil lawsuit in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, alleging it was defrauded in the deal. But the company never registered the deal with South Korean authorities, and a former <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> consultant has alleged the payments were part of a lobbying fund. A parallel investigation of the funds by a panel of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has uncovered evidence indicating that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shin </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> night club operator, may have received $ 1 million of the money, the Times said. Through a subpoena, the subcommittee on oversight and investigation obtained information on a $ 1 million bank draft to <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> drawn on the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s account with <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. That account is believed to be part of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s hotel fund, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has paid <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> $ 102,000 a year for several years for his consulting work, including introducing <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> officials to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>. The grand jury has subpoenaed <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, former Executive Vice President <PERSON> Welko </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasich </PERSON>, former Chief Financial Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGagh </PERSON>, former Vice President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, former Vice President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shin </PERSON>. The four executives resigned after the Korean hotel deal was made public early this year. All declined comment on the latest investigation, the Times said.

<TEXT>
 Prices fell slightly in a lackluster session on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday as the approaching holidays and upcoming balance of payments data for November gave little reason for activity. `` There just has n't been much trade around to speak of,'' one market maker said. `` People are simply loath to do anything'' before the Christmas holiday and the announcement of British trade figures scheduled for Friday, he added. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 3.2 points or 0.18 percent, to 1770.5, also the intraday low. Volume was a subdued 369.3 million shares, compared with the 473.9 million shares which changed hands Friday. Although Wall Street opened on sound footing, it did llittle to shore up support in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, dealers offered. By the close of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> Industrial Average was up a healthy 12.68 points at 2163.39. Commentators cautioned that trade figures due for release Friday would likely keep players anxious and sidelined during the coming week, unless unexpected news emerges to draw them off the fence.

 <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have ratified a labor agreement that will immediately reduce the size of train crews on about 30 percent of its operations.

Under the deal, one of the two brakeman on most trains will be eliminated. `` This breakthrough agreement is unique among major railroads because we can now immediately run freight trains in the covered areas with a locomotive engineer, a conductor and one breakman without phasing in the reduced crews through attrition of the workforce,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> president and chief operating officer. He said the result would be a more-efficient freight service. The agreement says employees in active service may elect to receive a separation allowance of $ 50,000, transfer to another location and receive up to $ 20,000 in relocation expenses, or accept a furlough with rights to return, plus a $ 15,000 payment. Snow said the contract efforts are part of CSXT's goal of reducing employment on its 19-state rail system to 30,000 employees, while reducing its route milage to 15,000 from 20,000 miles.

 Stock prices rose today, extending their yearend rally despite worries about the outlook for interest rates. Analysts said the market benefit from talk of more takeovers and buyouts, and from buying by program traders engaged in multiple strategies involving stocks and stock-index futures. At the same time, market-watchers said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> appeared likely to continue tightening credit to restrain economic growth that keeps exceeding most people's expectations. Consumer spending was generally described as strong going into the last week of the Christmas selling season. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not raised its discount rate since Aug. 9, when it increased the charge it imposes on loans to private financial institutions from 6 percent to 6 -LCB- percent. But brokers said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has taken other measures to tighten credit conditions as recently as last week, and may be planning a new discount-rate increase in the first few weeks of 1989. `` While consumers spread holiday cheer, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is casting itself as Scrooge,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, in a weekend bulletin to the firm's clients.

<TEXT>
 Most <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s restaurants, which boast an `` Always Open'' sign at each location, will change policy for one day to allow employees to have Christmas off. But there's one problem. Since the restaurants are always open, they never have to lock the doors. In fact, some do n't have locks on the doors and others have locks that have never been used and for which keys can not be found, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, director of marketing. This week, the chain is installing new locks on about 700 restaurants, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. `` This is all new to us,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s parent company. The La Mirada-based food chain also has to come up with closing policies, but <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the dilemma is the price to be paid for holiday spirit. `` Since management has the day off, we thought our thousands of field employees deserved the same courtesy,'' he said. About 200 of <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s 1,221 restaurants are franchise operations and about 50 or 60 of them will stay open, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynes </PERSON>, a publicist for <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s. All the others will close at 7 p.m. Christmas Eve and stay closed through Christmas Day for the first time since the chain of restaurants was founded 35 years ago.

 <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> acquired <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s stake in the publishing company on Monday, swapping a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> paper mill for Sugarman-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> stock. The $ 100 million deal also included a $ 44 million payment by <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> to companies controlled by <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>. In a joint announcement, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> said an agreement was reached to sell <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, paper mill to <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in exchange for <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> stock held by <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Barris </LOCATION>. The deal was part of a complete redemption of the 2.8 million Media General shares held by <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s companies, or 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> had said earlier that the shares cost him $ 111.6 million, or an average of $ 40.14 per share. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> failed in a bid to take over <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, whose publications include the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, The Richmond News Leader and several other daily and weekly newspapers. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> also unsuccessfully sought a seat for himself and two associates on the nine-member <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> board at the company's annual meeting in May <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> offered $ 70 per share, or $ 1.8 billion, for the company. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president, said <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> has agreed to drop remaining attempts to take over the company, including an appeal of a court decision that upheld the legality of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s dual stock structure. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, Media General chairman, and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, vice chairman, control <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s Class B shares, which have more than 70 percent of the stock voting power A merger involving <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> would require approval of two-thirds of the closely-held Class B stock. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the agreement, subject to certain conditions that could include a third-party purchase of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> paper mill, represented Media General's continued shift toward communications properties. However, the company will retain its interests in three other newsprint mills. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> is a Hollywood movie and television producer whose programs include game shows such as The New Dating Game. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, vice president and stock analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, said the deal announced Monday allowed <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> to get rid of <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> by sacrificing an asset that was not critical to its operations and without leveraging its balance sheet.

<TEXT>
 Hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has succeeded in forcing <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to call a shareholders' meeting to vote on a new board of directors, the threatened textile giant said Monday. <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> said in a statement from its <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, headquarters it had confirmed that holders of about 27 percent of the company's common stock _ including <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s 9.8 percent stake _ had called for the meeting. The Pepperell board was required to call the meeting if requested to do so by holders of 25 percent of its common stock. The statement said the board, which probably would meet later this week, was expected to schedule the meeting for Feb. 25. On Oct. 25, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> offered $ 1.4 billion, or $ 48 per share, for <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, an offer which the company's directors dismissed as inadequate. They claimed <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s bid was an effort to get the company befgs from a then-incomplete takeover of <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc.. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, the Chicago-based manufacturer of Fruit of the Loom underwear and Acme boots, asked other stockholders on Dec. 1 to join in requesting the meeting in an attempt to thwart management's resistance to the <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s request for the meeting said it would propose to remove <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s 11 current directors, replacing them with an entirely new slate. A Farley-backed board would be expected to rescind certain `` poison pill'' anti-takeover provisions from <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s bylaws that would increase the cost of the billion takeover attempt. However, the scheduling of a meeting does not guarantee <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s efforts to oust the board would succeed <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> still must seek support for its as-yet-unnamed nominees. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON> said Monday the company's stake in <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, plus shares already tendered to <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, give the hostile suitor about 56 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock. However, the tenders do not carry voting rights. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> objects to recent changes in the bylaws that allowed management to purchase additional shares, resulting in a possible $ 1.9 million profit to <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and $ 1.2 million to President <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>. Other changes benefiting management, including so-called `` golden parachutes'' for directors, have `` effectively prohibited any acquisition proposal or tender offer which lacks management's support, no matter how beneficial to shareholders,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s request for the meeting <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> also has filed lawsuits challenging <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover statutes <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, the country's largest publicly held textile manufacturer, has countered with lawsuits claiming <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s bid violates security and banking regulations because it is financed with too much debt. It also charges that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, improperly has used information gained during <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s takeover this year of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is a full-fledged bidder in the deal and has failed to disclose that to regulators. A federal district judge has agreed with portions of both lawsuits, sending the case to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, where a hearing is scheduled Jan. 11.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Fits Well Into Grand Met's Strategy, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> fits <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s international expansion strategy, even though some Grand Met shareholders have been concerned that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was an ailing target that nobody else apparently wanted, analysts said Monday Mineapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, which has suffered poor earnings, management turmoil and discontent among franchisees of its Burger King fast-food chain, said Sunday it agreed to be taken over by Grand Met for $ 5.68 billion cash, or $ 66 a share. Grand Met originally offered $ 60 a share on Oct. 4 and no other suitor stepped in during the 2 -LCB- - month takeover battle, which largely was fought in the courts and the newspapers `` We see <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> as a real opportunity and very much look forward to get into it and work with the people there,'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halford </PERSON>, a Grand Met spokesman, said Monday. Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> was not available for an interview, <PERSON> Halford </PERSON> said. When completed, the acquisition would be the largest, non-oil foreign acquisition by a British company. British buyers _ already among the biggest foreign purchasers of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> properties _ have stepped up purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in recent years, spurred by the weaker dollar. Grand Met has been one of the more active buyers, engaging in several billion dollars worth of transactions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the past year. Also on Monday, Grand Met announced it acquired two <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> restaurant chains for a total of about 20 million pounds, or about $ 37 million at current exchange rates. They are the West German <ORGANIZATION> Wienerwald </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 231 outlets, and the Spaghetti Factory, with five restaurants in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, whose products include <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> vegetables, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s frozen fish, and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, fits in well with Grand Met's strategy of focusing on foods, liquor and retailing and expanding those businesses worldwide, analysts said. Grand Met's own brands include J and B Scotch whisky, Smirnoff vodka, <PERSON> Alpo </PERSON> pet foods and <ORGANIZATION> Pearle </ORGANIZATION> vision care products. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Hoare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Govett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> represents a great deal for them, even at the higher price.'' `` It's a good strategy,'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said. `` Number one brands in the largest domestic market in the world should be susceptible to internationalization.'' Grand Met's strong liquor operations have little room for improvement, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Littleboy </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` The other two areas, retailing and food, particularly food, were starting to look like they were left behind, very much <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> oriented, very strong brands in the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION>, with no international presence. That's what <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> does. `` Pillsbury should give them those opportunities to see just how good they are in food,'' <PERSON> Littleboy </PERSON> said. Although the analysts said they were confident Grand Met could turn <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> around, Grand Met's share price has been depressed by shareholder concern over the acquisition. Grand Met's shares fell the equivalent of 1.8 cents to finish at $ 7.89 in Monday trading on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` With so many people in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> saying how badly managed <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was, it has been harder for Grand Met to convince its own shareholders what a good deal it is,'' <PERSON> Littleboy </PERSON> said. Grand Met's shares would be trading 15 percent higher had it not been for the takeover, <PERSON> Littleboy </PERSON> estimated, which he said `` implies skepticism, to say the least.'' But `` given their -LRB- Grand Met's -RRB- record and their management, personally I have confidence they can'' get <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> on the right track, <PERSON> Littleboy </PERSON> said. Here are details of other recent Grand Met acquisitions and a disposal: On Friday, Grand Met announced the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> betting chain for $ 606 million cash Grand Met lost in November a takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, which makes Irish whiskey Irish Distillers was taken over by friendly suitor <ORGANIZATION> Pernod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ricard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the French liquor company. In early October, Grand Met announced the sale of its 100-hotel Inter-Continental chain to the <ORGANIZATION> Seibu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.27 billion. Grand Met acquired the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distiller <ORGANIZATION> Heublein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.3 billion last year. It bought U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a tobacco company, for $ 450 million in 1980.

 The dollar rose against some foreign currencies and fell against others Monday in light trading as major traders prepared to close their books at the end of the year. Corporate customers and banks that deal in currencies are unlikely to take big positions for or against the dollar in the last two weeks of the year for fear of guessing wrong and spoiling their year-end financial statements, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, vice president for foreign exchange in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Why risk it?'' <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> said. Dealers said there was still some talk in the market that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would hike its discount rate, although few believed a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> move will occur before the beginning of the new year. The discount rate is what the central bank charges commercial banks for loans. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.08 yen to a closing 124.02 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 124.05 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it fell to 124.08 yen from 124.14 yen. The dollar fell against the British pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.8230 to buy one pound, dearer than $ 1.8150 late Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound rose to $ 1.8209 from $ 1.8193. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.7645 West German marks, up from 1.7584; 1.4891 Swiss francs, up from 1.4820; 1.1998 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2305; 6.0270 French francs, up from 6.0090; and 1,300.75 Italian lire, up from 1,296.50 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.7625 West German marks, down from 1.7635; 1.4870 Swiss francs, down from 1.4895; 6.0235 French francs, up from 5.9950; 1.9895 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9805; 1,296.50 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.1995 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2035 In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold bullion rose 38 cents to close at a bid $ 415.62 a troy ounce.

 The stock market climbed to a two-month high Monday, extending its yearend rally despite worries about the outlook for interest rates.

Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 841 up, 598 down and 538 unchanged.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> Monday agreed to go ahead with a ban on imports of hormone-treated meat as of Jan. 1 and tentatively adopted measures to counter any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation against its ban. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has threatened retaliation against <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> imports of, among others, boneless ham, canned tomatoes, fruit juices and alcoholic beverages. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> would be most affected by that. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers, meeting here Monday, accepted a recommendation by <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> External Relations Commissioner <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> not to postpone the ban again. Late last year, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> delayed the ban's implementation until Jan. 1. `` We do not envisage a new delay as there were no political or technical reasons'' to do so, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the ban will affect between $ 130 million and $ 150 million of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat exports a year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates have put the figure at $ 170 million. `` We're extremely disappointed; we had hoped that reason might prevail,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, administrator of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` If that's the decision that they've made, I suppose we have no other recourse except retaliation.'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that if the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> counterattacked against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would itself take further steps. `` It is fair to assume we will do something in response. We are working on it,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Klingon </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to delay the ban for a brief period to allow a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration and a new <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> executive <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which both take office in January, to settle the dispute. He said he was disappointed the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> did not have `` the flexibility or the willingness'' to grant the request. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> will exempt pet food from its ban imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat but added, `` We do not expect the Americans to accept this.'' He repeated the ban will be imposed for public health reasons. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> argues the use of hormones to fatten animals poses no health risk and has said the pet food exemption did not remove its concerns. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> says pet food accounts for about half of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say it represents only 30 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers also tentatively agreed to counter any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade retaliation in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ban on meat imports, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said. This would involve a 100 percent duty on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to the EEC of honey, unshelled nuts, dried fruit and canned corn that total $ 140.5 million a year. But <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said a final decision will only be made after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> retaliates against the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> hormone ban. Depending on the extent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation, other products might be added to the list, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said. Speaking of recent meetings with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to avert a trans-Atlantic trade war over the hormone ban, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said `` dialogue of the deaf'' was continuing. He said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was interested in limiting the damage of the conflict by finding ways to narrow the extent of a possible trade war. In late November, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation against the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ban would spark both retaliatory measures and action against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has said its ban on hormone-treated meat is legal under the rules of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the 96-nation world trade organization.

<HEAD>Another Virus Found In Packaged Software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Another virus has been discovered in packaged computer software, raising further concerns about the safety of commercially available programs. The latest virus was not dangerous and was spotted after only about 400 copies of the software had been shipped, but it highlighted again the vulnerability of software producers to viruses. `` This is widespread. This is affecting the biggest names in software publishing you can think of right now, across the board,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Tizes </PERSON>, a director and owner of <ORGANIZATION> MacGuide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. A virus is a fragment of computer code that attaches itself to other programs and spreads through a computer system Some can wipe out or alter information, while others such as the so-called nVIR virus cause no serious harm. The first known case of packaged software being secretly corrupted was in early 1987 in Freehand, a program from <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The hidden program flashed a message on the screen conveying a `` universal message of peace'' but did not cause any harm. The latest virus, a strain of nVIR, was found in seven programs on a compact disk from <ORGANIZATION> Quantum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The virus was detected with special virus screening programs. The disk is the second edition of a CD Rom called MegaROM that is for Apple Macintosh computers. The virus infected the disk _ a type of compact disk used to store computer data _ when it was being prepared for duplication at <ORGANIZATION> Nimbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, technical operations manager of the <ORGANIZATION> CD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rom </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Nimbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> said the virus came from a piece of software residing on a hard disk drive for Macintosh computers that was manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> CMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enhancements </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He faulted <ORGANIZATION> CMS </ORGANIZATION> for not alerting its disk drive customers, such as <PERSON> Nimbus </PERSON>, about the virus threat. CMS President <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Farooque </PERSON> said in an interview Monday that he had not been able to verify that the virus had come from his company. He conceded some of his employees had told people at Nimbus previously that the virus had come on a <ORGANIZATION> CMS </ORGANIZATION> floppy disk used to prepare the hard disk for receiving data. But he said, `` It's possible that ... they are communicating back and forth information that may or may not be true. <PERSON> Farooque </PERSON> said the company voluntarily was helping people get rid of the viruses without admitting responsibility for them. Quantum Leap was alerted to the virus on Dec. 9 and began alerting recipients of the infected MegaRom disks last week, according to the president, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>. The infected disks are imprinted with a green decorative pattern. <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> said new disks that are virus-free and have a blue pattern are being shipped out as replacements. Almost half of the infected disks were shipped to members of the computer press for review. The disks are filled with programs, known as shareware or freeware, that are available for free from places such as computer bulletin boards. Computer viruses are far more widespread in commercially available software than is generally realized, <PERSON> Tizes </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> MacGuide </PERSON> was assembling demonstration software from major publishers for its own CD Rom disk and found seven strains of the nVIR virus in programs from seven major publishers. `` Invariably the companies did n't know'' about the viruses when he alerted them, said <PERSON> Tizes </PERSON>, a medical doctor. He said one had already made a recall of the infected disks, which had been shipped out to pilot customers.

 Takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has purchased another 1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, raising his stake to 16.22 percent of the third-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> disclosed Monday. In a routine filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also included a letter addressed to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> in which <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> denied rumors of improperly acting in concert with an unidentified investor to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest single stockholder. `` I've read with interest newspaper reports that unnamed <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officials have been speculating that I may be acting with another investor or partner in connection with my <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> holdings,'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>. `` While I think it is inappropriate for any <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> official to use the newspapers as a forum to speculate on my intentions, I will nevertheless respond and tell you I am not acting with any partner or other undisclosed person with respect to my <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> holdings.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON>, at the company's <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, office, said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> customarily declined comment on purchases of its stock. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> rose 75 cents a share to $ 51.37 -LCB-. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that he holds 39.67 million <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares, including the 1 million purchased from Dec. 13 to Dec. 14 for prices ranging from $ 51.37 -LCB- to $ 52.37 -LCB-. He gave no reason for increasing the stake. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has been increasing his pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> in recent weeks, raising speculation he might resurrect a failed takeover bid for the company, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil concern behind <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Last week, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> stoked the rumors by disclosing he had purchased 2.6 million shares in early December for an average of $ 50.37 -LCB- a share Securities analysts have said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s moves evidently reflect his impatience at the pace of the company's post-bankruptcy restructuring plan announced earlier this year. That plan has failed to substantially raise the value of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 240 million shares outstanding. Last spring, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> made an offer for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> valued at $ 14.5 billion, or $ 60 a share, as part of a shareholder proxy fight to oust the company's board. But his strategy was defeated by shareholders loyal to the board. But since then, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s dismal stock performance has increased the possibility that more shareholders would align themselves with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> if he undertook another takeover attempt, analysts have said.

<HEAD>Platinum Takes Another Big Hit; Coffee Continues Percolating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Platinum futures prices closed sharply lower for the third consecutive session Monday, but recovered some ground after key South African producers implied the use of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s platinum-free catalytic converters might be limited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> On other markets, coffee futures prices continued to rise as a dockworkers' strike in the major producing country of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> promised scarce supplies during the peak consumption season; energy futures dipped as temperatures rose; and grain and soybean futures prices fought off early pressures to register modest gains. After platinum plunged the daily trading limit of $ 25 an ounce for two straight sessions, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> increased the limit to $ 37.50 early Monday and the January contract promptly hit the new floor. That's when South African producers mounted a counterattack, implying to analysts that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s revolutionary catalytic converters had replaced platinum with palladium _ a metal the plaqtinum producers contend will be ineffective in dealing with the leaded gas still very much in use outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` That may have helped shore up platinum,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopolous </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` but it's a good guess how much and how long. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market was responsible for 55 percent -LRB- of the platinum used in catalytic converters -RRB-, so if it's not a catastrophe for platinum,'' she added, `` it's not far from one either.'' Most of the West's supply of platinum comes from South African mines. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which announced its technological breakthrough last week, has declined so far to reveal the new materials in its converters. Platinum rose $ 4.50 for the spot month, with the contract for delivery in December reaching $ 529.30 a troy ounce. But the precious metal declined $ 29.20 to $ 30.70 an ounce for the deferred months. Palladium, also traded at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, was down $ 2.15 to $ 4.40. Gold, meanwhile, was up 40 cents to 50 cents an ounce, with December at the Comex at $ 414.40 a troy ounce. Silver was up 2.5 cents to 2.8 cents an ounce, with December at $ 6.11 an ounce. Coffee futures enjoyed a fourth straight session of gains at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Coffee, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as a dockworkers' strike in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> approached the one-week mark and other Central American exporters and South American rival <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> were saddled with problems of their own. `` Either there's harvest delays because of bad weather, or transportation problems getting to port,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` And even those that have the coffee in port are having trouble because they're only allowed to export so much during each quarter and they're already at quota,'' she added. Coffee futures climbed 3.13 cents to 5.89 cents, with December at 145.38 cents a pound. A turnaround in weekly weather forecasts was called the main culprit in an across-the-board drop in energy futures at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` They got slapped down a notch because everybody was calling for colder-than-usual temperatures and they got turned around,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, vice president for trading and research at <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Traders bailed out of their long positions in heating oil and pulled everything else down.'' Crude oil slipped 0.14 to 0.41 cents, with January at $ 16.31 a barrel; heating oil was down 0.75 cent to 1.27 cents, with January at 50.75 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 0.45 cent lower to 0.22 cent higher, January at 45.35 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed to mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Traders said both pits opened under pressure because of a lack of confirmation of a big export deal to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that set up Friday's rally. Rumors the Soviets would buy 400,000 tons of soymeal and 2.5 million tons of corn also was behind increased farmer selling over the weekend _ a second factor pressuring prices. And on top of that, the market reacted early to reports of rain over the weekend in the soybean growing regions of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and a forecast calling for more during the week ahead. `` Even though the bears pushed it down a little bit, they never really broke it,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Wheat was unchanged to 3 -LCB- cents higher, with December at $ 4.36 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 3 -RCB- cents lower to 1 \ cent higher, with December at $ 2.70 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3 -RCB- cents higher, with December at $ 2.25 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 7 cents to 13 -LCB- cents higher, with January at $ 7.93 -LCB- a Livestock and pork futures prices were mixed at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .38 cent lower to .45 cent higher, with December at 73.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .32 cent lower, with January at 83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent lower to .83 cent higher, with December at 44.65 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .90 cent higher, with February at 45.40 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Monday approved the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Northeastern shuttle service to real estate magnate <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, a $ 365 million deal that labor leaders had challenged as a union-busting effort. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Houston-based holding company that is <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent firm, has been trying to sell off the profitable shuttle, arguing that struggling <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> needs the cash to survive. But the carrier's unions have argued that the shuttle sale is simply a guise for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s true motive: to dismantle <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, whose 30,000 workers are represented by three militant unions, and eventually reconstruct it as a non-union airline. `` There is no doubt that an ongoing struggle has and will continue to exist between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its'' unions, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote in his opinion. `` However, the court feels that equally plausible is the idea that management is seeking to rebuild the company and place it on a sound financial footing.'' The transaction must still be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, which must affirm that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> can operate the shuttle safely and manage it properly. The flamboyant <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> announced his agreement to purchase the shuttle for cash on Oct. 12, saying he would turn the shuttle, which makes hourly flights among <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, into `` an absolute diamond.'' He said he would rename the service `` The Trump Shuttle,'' and redecorate its 17 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jetliners, including painting them with gold, red and black stripes. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns casinos in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a helicopter service that flies between the gambling center and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other prestigious properties. Speaking from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he planned to begin service on the new shuttle in February. `` This is now a business deal that does not have obstacles in its path,'' he said. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said the carrier was `` gratified at the court's decision today.'' `` We're committed to focusing our energies on solving the real problems at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' Bakes added. `` We want to resolve our economic problems at the bargaining table and would welcome the presence of the union leaders at the bargaining table to join us in moving this airline forward.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We're diappointed in the outcome but we'll continiue to do everything we can to secure the rights and future of Eastern pilots.'' <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> also said the decision `` is not a major setback in our efforts to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> from dismantling <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. We are studying the options still available to us and will continue to pursue this issue in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, said the union was disappointed in <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s ruling and would appeal it. `` Our concern is for the employees who remain with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON> said. `` We believe this is the death knell for Eastern.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants, also joined the suit. On Dec. 2, the unions asked <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> to block the deal, saying it violated federal labor laws by undermining employees' working conditions without bargaining over them first with union leaders. But <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ruled that the shuttle deal did not trigger the labor law's protections. He noted that in September, the courts had approved a far more severe scheduling constriction by Eastern that involved 4,000 layoffs, the elimination of service to 14 cities and the curtailment of 15 percent of the carrier's flights. `` The impact of the sale to Trump Shuttle pales in comparison to the impact of the September 1988 schedule change,'' the judge wrote. The shuttle, which employs 850 people and makes 62 flights daily, has been one of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s few profit-makers, earning an annual average profit of $ 17 million over the last five years, according to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. Overall, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 233.7 million over the first nine months of 1988, he said. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote that if the unions are right and the airline is not truly trying to improve itself, `` then <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s executives are acting out a cruel hoax'' upon the government and the public. `` The passage of time should prove whether this is true,'' he said. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who testified before <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> on Dec. 7, has vowed to boost morale at the shuttle and to recognize the unions but has declined to guarantee current wages for the employees. Eastern has offered to retain any shuttle workers who wish to remain with the company. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> announced in February that it would sell the shuttle for $ 225 million to a new subsidiary it planned to form. But Eastern's unions blocked that transaction in the courts, and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> announced in July that the deal had been canceled. Since he acquired <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's sixth largest carrier, in 1986, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been embroiled in bitter disputes with the unions representing the carrier's mechanics, pilots and flight attendants. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has sought wage concessions, while the unions have countered with lobbying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and public relations campaigns. The sale would give <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> all 17 aircraft, landing and takeoff slots at airports in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 14 airport gates and ground equipment.

 The British owner-to-be of Burger King is expected to beef up the chain's standing in the sizzling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fast-food competition but rivals are n't conceding anything yet, franchisees and securities analysts said Monday. `` They've been almost rudderless. I see these guys from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coming in and ending -LRB- Burger King's -RRB- state of confusion,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Uphoff </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> succeeded in its 2 -LCB- - month effort to take over Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Burger King's parent, on Sunday when <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board agreed to stop fighting and accept a $ 5.68 billion offer for the entire Grand Met executives have indicated they will move quickly to improve Miami-based Burger King, which has been criticized by franchise owners and other industry figures as the company has slipped further behind kingpin <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're very optimistic,'' Burger King Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said Monday. He said management had not received any word directly from Grand Met, but `` we believe they are committed to Burger King. We seem to be performing relatively even with the industry and I certainly anticipate we will now out-perform the market.'' Upstart <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s and struggling <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s have also had more-positive performances lately than No. 2 Burger King, which last fiscal year totaled $ 5.4 billion in sales. `` I think that they really believe that <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is a diamond in the rough,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who owns 23 <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> restaurants in the Northeast. `` Amid this whole takeover we -LRB- Burger King -RRB- were the key to making this whole thing work.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes the area's businesses and community, said: `` We see Grand Met as a savior.'' `` Pillsbury kind of treated Burger King like a stepchild and did n't know what to do with it,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, Grand Met's chief executive for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, called <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> `` a perfect fit'' in helping Grand Met become a world leader in food, drink and retailing. `` Pillsbury foods and Burger King will play a vital role in helping us to realize these objectives,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The merger will greatly expand Grand Metropolitan's established presence in the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketplace, while enabling us to open new business opportunities for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> in global markets. Burger King, founded in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> 34 years ago by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McLamore </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgerton </PERSON>, was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 for $ 18 million. It had 274 restaurants. It now has 5,578. The subsidiary's profits have skidded from $ 119.2 million in the 1986 fiscal year to $ 48.2 million in fiscal 1988. It averages $ 1 million a year in sales per store, compared to $ 1.5 million for <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, $ 920,000 for <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and $ 786,000 -LRB- in 1987 -RRB- for <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s. McDonald's total sales for fiscal 1987 were $ 14.3 billion in its more than 10,000 restaurants. <PERSON> Uphoff </PERSON> suggested the new ownership will want to improve Burger King's marketing, in the aftermath of much-criticized campaigns such as the `` Find Herb'' promotion of a few years ago. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said to play catch-up with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, Burger King must improve consistency. `` Even if you can convince them to come in, if you do n't give them an acceptable visit with consistently speedy service, clean restaurant and restrooms, they're not going to come back,'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s competitors said they did n't expect the takeover to have a major impact immediately on their business. `` It's going to take some time. Nothing's going to happen overnight,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s, based in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` Having a new owner will clarify at least who's calling the shots, but that does n't mean there's a strategic plan in place. For <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s, which has been recovering after slipping financially the past two years, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said the confused situation at Burger King has `` given us an opportunity to tell our message positively.'' <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s, based in <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, has been growing fastest among the industry's leaders, said spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, and should hold its own against any new Burger King initiatives. From McDonald's <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> headquarters, spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebeling </PERSON> said the successful recipe of good service, good value and cleanliness is what the industry leader concerns itself with. `` We do n't talk about our competitors or the industry,'' <PERSON> Ebeling </PERSON> said. `` We speak only of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. Just because they change ownership ... they're still Brand X.''

<TEXT>
 The board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday approved the filing of a draft plan of reorganization, a major step toward the company's emergence from bankruptcy, the steelmaker said. A majority of the directors at a special meeting voted in favor of filing the plan to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wheeling-Pitt </PERSON> said in a statement. The company has been restructuring its debts and operations under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since April 1985. Creditors were owed about $ 890 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing. The plan was drafted by the board's reorganization committee, said <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pitt </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubensky </PERSON>, whose ownership of about 34 percent of the company's stock makes him <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s largest stockholder The draft plan does not consider the claims of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Steelworkers </LOCATION> or the effects of a new basic labor agreement which must be negotiated, the company said in a written statement. The company said it anticipates negotiations will ultimately result in a final plan of reorganization to be submitted to creditors and stockholders for their vote and then filed in Bankruptcy Court for approval.

 A federal judge rejected a plea agreement from developer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Monday and sentenced him to two years in prison and ordered him to pay $ 650,000 in restitution for bank fraud The case is similar to one that resulted in a 10-year prison term for Kroh Thursday in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> sentenced the former president of <ORGANIZATION> Kroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to serve the two-year term consecutively with the 10-year sentence he received last week. In the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> pleaded guilty to two counts of an eight-count indictment on Oct. 14. Under a plea agreement reached with federal prosecutors, <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> admitted he understated his liabilities in financial statements to two <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> banks from which he was seeking loans. Prosecutors agreed to recommend probation, but <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he could not go along with the recommendation, which he called a tremendous break for <ORGANIZATION> Kroh </ORGANIZATION>. `` The defendant, in all likelihood, judging from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, would more than likely have been convicted here on all counts just as he was there,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` And in all likelihood a sentence on the order of what was imposed there in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> would probably have been appropriate here.'' The judge ordered <ORGANIZATION> Kroh </ORGANIZATION> to make restitution of $ 400,000 to <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Trust of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> and $ 250,000 to <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Trust of Prairie Village. The cases in the two states stem from the collapse of the <LOCATION> Kroh </LOCATION> real estate empire. <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON>, pleaded guilty in May to bank fraud and conspiracy. He served two months in a federal prison. His original three-year sentence was reduced in July, partly because he agreed to testify against his brother.

 <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting a takeover bid involving a British food conglomerate, announced Monday it was acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flavors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. Milwaukee-based <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> described the acquisition as unrelated to the current $ 563 million takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voltage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is jointly owned by New York-based investors <ORGANIZATION> Clifford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British conglomerate. The company said the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flavors </ORGANIZATION> acquisition had been in the works since early November, a month before High Voltage first announced its offer for Universal Foods. High Voltage last week raised its offer for Universal to $ 35 a share, a total of about $ 563.5 million based on <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION>'s roughly 16.1 million outstanding common shares. High Voltage's initial offer of $ 30.50 a share was rejected by Universal earlier this month, and the company said it would review the latest offer in due course. Universal's stock rose 87 -LCB- cents to $ 36 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> said the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flavors </ORGANIZATION>, which has annual sales of about $ 38 million, would `` allow for increased sales opportunities and provide significant synergies.'' Imperial Flavors manufactures and sells flavorings and other ingredients to the dairy, ice cream, cultured products and bakery industries. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> is a maker of food colors and flavors, yeast products, frozen potatoes and Italian-style cheeses.

<HEAD>First Bank System Expects To Lose $300 Million In 1988</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will lose about $ 300 million in its current fiscal year, largely because it will book a $ 500 million loss on the sale of a securities portfolio, the bank holding company announced Monday. The bank will sell about $ 4.6 billion of its $ 7.5 billion investment securities portfolio because interest rates have risen on the money the bank borrowed to buy the securities, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman. <PERSON> Schoenke </PERSON> said the loss would not prompt the company to cut back on employment or on its branch system. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is one of the nation's 50 biggest bank holding companies, and is <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s largest banking concern. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s expected $ 300 million net loss for the year would follow profits of $ 49.6 million in 1987 and $ 202.9 million in 1986. When the securities sales are completed in the first quarter of 1989, total assets of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> will be approximately $ 23 billion, down from the current $ 28.3 billion, <LOCATION> Ankeny </LOCATION> said. Most of the securities to be sold are government bonds, many of which were purchased during the third quarter of fiscal 1986. The $ 4.6 billion portfolio is earning about 6.93 percent interest, nearly as much interest as the bank is paying on the $ 4.1 billion it borrowed to buy the bonds and other securities, <PERSON> Schoenke </PERSON> said. Interest on the short-term loans the bank took out to buy the securities was increasing, threatening to surpass the amount of interest the bank is earning on the securities, <PERSON> Schoenke </PERSON> said. By selling the securities before they reach maturity, the bank is losing the $ 500 million of equity it used to purchase them, <PERSON> Schoenke </PERSON> said. `` We decided to take this action because the anticipated economic costs, risks and other implications associated with the portfolio hedging strategy could not be justified,'' said <PERSON> D.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ankeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` In doing so we have substantially reduced our risk profile and helped position the company for improved profitability.'' The action has been reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Even accounting for the sales, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> still will exceed minimum regulatory levels for liquidity, <LOCATION> Ankeny </LOCATION> said.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Bank's Sale of Mortgage-Backed Securities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge ruled Monday against <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Comptroller of the Currency in a dispute with securities dealers over the bank's sale of mortgage-backed securities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ruling in a suit by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, rejected the comptroller's decision to allow the bank to sell mortgage-backed securities backed by its own mortgage loans <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, the main unit of the nation's sixth-largest bank holding company, was considering an appeal. She did n't know if the decision would force the bank to stop selling mortgage-backed securities pending appeal. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> ruled that the bank's sale of such securities would violate the Glass-Steagall Act, Depression-era legislation that, among other things, limits the rights of banks to enter the securities business. The association's suit is against the comptroller, and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> intervened on behalf of the defendant. The dispute centers on the decade-old practice of banks and savings and loans to sell packages of mortgages on the so-called secondary market, rather than selling single loans. The association maintained in its suit that banks should offer the mortgage-backed securities through a dealer rather than packaging and selling the securities themselves. In an unrelated matter, a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> official disclosed that the bank had added $ 100 million worth of loans on <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> real estate to its list of non-performing loans in the fourth quarter. The change is balanced by positive developments elsewhere and does n't affect the bank's predictions that fourth-quarter earnings, scheduled for release Jan. 17, will show an increase over the third quarter, said the official, Senior Vice President <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>EATONTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Horton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had fired 87 employees who failed a recent round of drug tests, slashing by 13 percent the workforce at the mobile home manufacturer that is <LOCATION> Eatonton </LOCATION>'s biggest employer. The firings on Friday, which were precipitated by a round of drug tests that began last Tuesday, also triggered a wave of calls by job-seekers as word of the dismissals spread through the town of 5,000 about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, the company's personnel manager, said the company undertook the drug testing because apparent employee drug use was hurting production and quality. `` We just ca n't operate with -LRB- drug use -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. `` There's too much dangerous equipment out there, and it was costing us a fortune trying to put up with it. Most of those fired after failing drug tests Friday were production workers, although some were in management, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. There is no union for production workers at the plant. <ORGANIZATION> Horton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> instituted a voluntary drug rehabilitation program three years ago, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said, but it had only limited success. Several months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Horton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> started drug screening for new employees and notified current workers they would be subject to drug testing. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said the latest tests came after various complaints by plant employees about co-workers. `` When we heard that several times in the last two or three weeks, we just decided to go ahead and drug test,'' he said. `` I'll promise you this. This was n't done without a lot of tears and a lot of concern. There's more than just jobs here. There's homes There's children. There's Christmases ...'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> hired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> to carry out the urinalysis last Tuesday, testing for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and PCP. The procedure included a re-test and verification for samples indicating drug use. Of the 87 fired, 31 had participated in the company's voluntary drug rehabilitation program at one time or another, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Horton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> officials had thought the tests would reveal a higher number of drug users. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said further testing was planned. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said some of the fired employees possibly could return to work at <ORGANIZATION> Horton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION>, but that could only occur under stringent conditions for the employee's rehabilitation. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said the firings had `` knocked fire out of production'' in the plant Friday. But <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> Homes </PERSON> was swamped with job calls Monday as news of the firings spread, he said. `` I had already closed applications for the rest of the year, and now I'm probably going to have to open them back up,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. `` We probably wo n't do anything until after Christmas.''
