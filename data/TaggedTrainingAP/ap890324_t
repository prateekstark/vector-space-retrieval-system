 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was sentenced Friday to the maximum 8 1-3 to 25 years in prison for killing his illegally adopted daughter in a case that riveted national attention on the problems of domestic violence. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a disbarred attorney, spoke about the charges for the first time just before he was sentenced by state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on his manslaughter conviction for the 1987 death of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> recommended against parole. `` His extraordinary narcissism and self-involvement, his extreme need to control everyone ... led him to become the instrument of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death,'' <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> said before passing sentence. `` There is nothing in the record to mitigate the extreme callousness and harshness of his conduct.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> denied hitting the girl and said she received `` constant love.'' `` Those children were not locked in a house of horror,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and the infant boy he also adopted illegally. But Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCusker </PERSON> told the court <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death resulted from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s `` life of violence, selfishness and self-gratification at the expense of other people.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has shown not one ounce of remorse for killing <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McCusker </PERSON> said. `` I understand the meaning of remorse,'' said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, who did not testify at his trial. `` I have remorse about losing my life.'' `` I feel that pain every day,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told the judge, adding that the loss belongs to all those `` whose life <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> touched -LRB- and received -RRB- the love that she gave.'' <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s battered companion, watched the sentencing on television at the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office of her attorney, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, who quoted her as saying, `` How can he stand there and lie with such a straight face?'' `` He just got up there and lied and she's furious,'' Ms. <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> said of Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s reaction to <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s statements. `` He was weaving together this totally untrue and fantastic rendition of what happened.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was convicted Jan. 30 of first-degree manslaughter in <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death but was acquitted of the more serious charge of second-degree murder. He had received the child at birth from an unmarried teen-ager and raised her as his own rather than fulfilling his promise to arrange for the baby's adoption. On Nov. 2, 1987, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was taken unconscious from the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> shared with <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. A 16-month-old boy also was found and eventually returned to his natural mother. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> died three days later; murder charges were filed against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. Charges against Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> were dropped when prosecutors said she was `` so physically and mentally incapacitated on the night of the murder that she was not criminally responsible for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death.'' In testimony against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> described an 11-year relationship with him that included beatings, brainwashing, food deprivation, bizarre punishments and drug use. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told the judge <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> received `` constant nurturing, constant caring, constant love'' and desribed their relationship as `` joyous, superb, delightful.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said he regretted a delay in medical attention that may have contributed to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death. `` I feel I should have sensed when I came home a need for medical attention,'' he said. `` If there was anything wrong with <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> when I left, I would not have left.'' He denied hitting the child, but said, `` I do n't deny that during the course of administering CPR, OK, I could have caused some'' injury. He dispassionately discussed the technical aspects of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s bruises. `` The testimony established <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> was basically a fine human being,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had a `` happy and cheerful nature'' and never hit <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> smiled, chuckled and fidgeted while his lawyers offered lengthy presentencing motions. Behind them sat <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Launders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s biological mother, and <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiegel </PERSON>, the grandmother of <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s other illegally adopted child. Both women cried when the sentence was delivered and Mrs. <PERSON> Smiegel </PERSON> nodded in approval. `` It's a lie,'' Ms. <PERSON> Launders </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s declaration of mourning. `` I do n't believe he feels anything. I do n't think he has the capability to feel for anybody but himself.'' Four jurors and an alternate from the trial also attended the sentencing. `` I think he deserved the maximum,'' said juror <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jared </PERSON>. `` Society should be protected from him,'' said juror <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthell </PERSON>. `` I think he's a very violent person who committed a terrible, heinous crime.'' Under the general practice in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> would serve a maximum of 16 years and eight months _ two-third of the legal maximum _ if he earns time off for good behavior. Technically, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in seven years because he has served 16 months of the 8 1-3-year minimum term since he has been held without bail from the time of his arrest on Nov. 2, 1987. <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said a notice of appeal was filed Friday, adding, `` We're very optimistic It is fair to say this was just round one.'' <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> received hundreds of letters _ from adoptive parents, childless couples and people abused as children _ urging him to give <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> the maximum term in <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s beating death. `` We had recommended that he get the maximum. Few defendants have so richly deserved that recommendation,'' District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said later. `` We hope the case serves as a catalyst to stem child and drug abuse.'' Court sources said the letters came from around the country and as far away as <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. None of the letters recommended leniency for <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the sources said; some demanded the death penalty, which <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> does not have.

 A 50-pound mountain lion was seized Thursday in a one-bedroom <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> apartment, where it had spent the last few months `` running around, bouncing off the furniture,'' a state spokesman said. `` It was fully clawed, not an ideal pet for an apartment,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Florence </PERSON>, an officer with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>.

The owner said he had bought it as a 3-month-old kitten and `` thought it would be a neat thing to have'' but then it apparently outgrew its cuteness, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> said. The owner was charged with possession of an endangered species. `` The cat was just being kept in his apartment,'' <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> said. `` He kept it in a small room.

He said the cat, 6 months old and 18 inches high, about a third of its full-grown size, had all its teeth. <PERSON> Drossel </PERSON> said the farm would keep the cat as a favor for the state until the <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> decided what to do with it. `` It's not like they could take it to <LOCATION> Bide-A-Wee </LOCATION> and hope some one adopts it,'' <PERSON> Drossel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Battle Shifts To Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House passage of a plan to raise the minimum wage shifts the partisan battle to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where the leading proponent of an increase is urging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to refrain from further veto threats while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> settles on a final bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 248-171 Thursday in favor of legislation that would raise the minimum wage from the current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.55 by October 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> then joined the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on an Easter recess that ends April 3. High on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agenda when it returns is a bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., that would raise the minimum wage to $ 4.65 by 1992 <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has said he is open to amending his bill, and in a statement issued after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote he asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above $ 4.25, to keep an open mind until the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agree on a bill. `` This is an excellent opportunity for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration to demonstrate that they can work together and in doing so achieve a fair increase in the minimum wage and an honest training wage,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted that a six-month sub-minimum training wage covering all newly hired employees be created in any legislation to raise the minimum wage, a provision he said will help offset potential job losses caused by raising the minimum. Sponsors of the House bill, while disputing <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> projections of massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job. That falls far short of the White House demand and, with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also opposed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s training-wage proposal, that issue likely will be a major sticking point in any attempts to reach a compromise. Several Republicans insisted that Democrats were going to have to give in to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ who appears to have the votes to sustain a veto _ or let a ninth year pass without any change in the minimum wage. `` The question is do you want a bill or do you want a political issue?'' Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, R-Wis., said during an unsuccessful <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> effort to substitute <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership's `` If you truly want to raise the minimum wage this is the only game in town.'' But Democrats argued they had given enough by cutting the final increase from $ 4.65 an hour to $ 4.55 and by adding the new-hire wage. As amended, the House bill would boost the minimum wage to $ 3.85 an hour on Oct. 1, to $ 4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $ 4.55 a year later. The provision for the new-hire wage, to be pegged at 85 percent of the minimum wage, would expire Sept. 30, 1992. It also would expand exemptions allowing small businesses to pay wages lower than the minimum wage and would allow employers of workers who earn tips to pay them 50 percent of the minimum wage, down from the current 60 percent. Current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less than $ 362,000 from the minimum-wage law; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill increased that level to $ 500,000. The provision is rarely used, however, because of confusing regulations lawmakers say will be simplified in conference committee if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passes a minimum-wage bill.

<HEAD>Chilean Grapes Returning _ at Higher Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fresh Chilean grapes are being trucked across the country today after a two-week absence from store shelves because of a cyanide poisoning scare, industry leaders say. Consumers may see slightly higher prices on the produce initially, but prices are expected to drop back to pre-scare levels in a couple of weeks when supply catches up with demand, they said. Losses to Chilean exporters and to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fruit importers as a result of the cyanide scare over grapes and other produce are estimated at $ 240 million, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bown </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. Some of those losses may be offset by a plan being developed by the Chilean government to compensate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> importers, wholesalers and retailers as well as Chilean growers and exporters, <PERSON> Bown </PERSON> said. Officials at the Chilean embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not return telephone calls for comment on the plan Thursday. An estimated $ 50 million to $ 75 million worth of Chilean fruit is being destroyed under the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s advisory that was issued after the agency on March 12 found traces of cyanide in two grapes from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> Earlier in the month an anonymous caller to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in the Chilean capital of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> had threatened to inject cyanide in export fruit. Some 2 million to 3 million crates of the fruit _ grapes, berries, pears, nectarines, peaches, melon and apples _ had been removed from store shelves or was being held in warehouses until the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> concluded last week that it would have to be destroyed because it could not be readily inspected. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> then announced a plan for stepped-up inspections of Chilean fruit at the docks and on ships to clear the way for the Chilean exports to get back into the stores with safety assurances. <PERSON> Bown </PERSON> said the Chilean fruit industry is anticipating a `` sustained level of consumer demand'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is doing all it can to ensure that fruit coming from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> will be `` fresh, nutritious, of premium quality and available at a reasonable price.'' The reason, he said, is simple: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is by far our biggest and best customer _ and we want to keep it that way.'' Exporters are concentrating their efforts on returning table grapes to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, since they constitute 70 percent of Chilean fruit exports. Pears and nectarines will follow, and should be on some store shelves by the weekend, <PERSON> Bown </PERSON> said. There was no estimate when other fruits may begin appearing. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has been holding up distribution until laboratory tests can give inspectors a better idea how to see evidence of cyanide tampering. Prices initially may be `` slightly higher'' than they had been before the scare began because of pent-up demand, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carstens </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 65 companies that import Chilean fruit. `` When you return fruit to the pipeline, the initial demand will be very, very strong and ... the initial impact of the first few days might be perhaps slightly higher in terms of our prices to the retailers,'' he said. Speaking for retailers, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tryon </PERSON>, director of produce for 3,200 Super Valu stores and president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We wo n't see dramatic increases in costs.'' Neither Bown nor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzworth </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, would discuss details of the Chilean government's plan for compensation. <PERSON> Holzworth </PERSON> said the Chileans are negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on a line of credit so that <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> can `` set up a financial structure that will allow importers working with their buyers to get the fruit -LRB- that must be destroyed -RRB- out of the pipeline'' and get new shipments of fresh fruit back in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Say USDA Ignoring Current Drought Conditions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Farm state lawmakers say the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> is mishandling last year's emergency drought relief and ignoring this year's arid, potentially disastrous conditions on the High Plains. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarpalius </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat and member of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains, said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> is extremely dry, yet he ca n't find out `` from anybody'' what `` we can do to help our farmers.'' At a hearing Thursday, an angry Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., said the central part of the country is `` blowing away ... and I ca n't get any damn answers,'' because of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's slow pace in filling key policy jobs at `` People are crawling out of train wrecks faster ... than they're getting people on board,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said during a subcommittee hearing on <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the $ 3.9 billion drought bill <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, administrator of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, countered that farmers receiving drought benefits do not face an undue paperwork burden. He also said he does n't believe the agency has suffered during the transition to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. As of Feb. 28, more than 558,000 producers have received disaster payments and emergency feed assistance amounting to more than $ 2.7 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> testified. The amount paid to date represents 70 percent of what the agency anticipates will go to farmers stricken by the devastating drought of 1988, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said he was not aware of efforts at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to draft 1989 drought relief, although subcommittee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., said it's `` no secret the central part of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is blowing away right now. <PERSON> Sarpalius </PERSON> said he supports another drought-relief bill this year, because <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> wheat crops are `` burned up'' and decimated by insects. Livestock also has suffered. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said drought conditions extend from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The dust is blowing. ... The seed wo n't germinate,'' said de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, asking <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether farmers must plant seed when they know it wo n't germinate in order to collect disaster relief. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivinius </PERSON>, an Elgin, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, wheat producer and secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs to consider extending drought disaster assistance. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, director of congressional relations for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had `` problems, misunderstandings, foul-ups, and general disregard for the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' when promulgating regulations for emergency livestock feeding programs under the drought bill. `` For all the good intentions in the drought bill, it may be for naught with many livestock producers because of the lack of good follow-through and good faith on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Keys </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Integration Gains in Danger, Report Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Southern schools are the nation's most integrated as a result of court orders and federal compliance plans dating from two decades ago, but a new report says clear signs of erosion are threatening their achievements. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> `` show major increases in segregation and have joined the list of the nation's most segregated states for black students,'' said the study released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Other Southern and border states, including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, are experiencing gradual declines that may reflect a failure by many fast-growing districts to update their desegregation plans, the report says. The report, based on federal statistics, cited encouraging trends in black-white integration through mandatory city-suburban busing plans in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and elsewhere. But the picture was uniformly grim for Hispanics. `` Hispanic students are becoming more highly segregated in virtually every part of the country and among each major subgroup,'' the report said. Hispanic students are increasingly isolated in center cities with declining white enrollments, it said, and have been largely ignored by the government agencies and civil rights groups that brought about the desegregation of black schools. `` The march to school integration is certainly not over, and school systems are finding no quick and easy solutions,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oglesby </PERSON>, president-elect of the association, said in issuing the study of desegregation trends from 1968 to 1986. At the national level, the study found that school desegregation remained relatively stable in the 1980s `` in spite of the harsh attacks by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the widespread impression that the policy was being abandoned.'' Nevertheless, the study said, the federal government should `` end its attacks on school desegregation and its efforts to dismantle plans that are stable.'' Other positive steps would be to resume research on effective desegregation techniques and offer assistance to districts trying to desegregate, it said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> professor and co-author of the study, suggested that the nation make a concerted effort to achieve residential integration which would automatically result in integrated local schools. He also said rapidly developing areas should update their desegregation plans. The report uses federal statistics to rate regions, states and cities on their desegregation efforts. <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON> said it is not meant as a commentary on the quality of education in particular communities, but noted there is `` a very strong relationship'' between high minority student populations, low test scores and high dropout rates. The study said Hispanic segregation has always been worst among Puerto Ricans in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> but statistics show alarming trends elsewhere. The percentage of Hispanic enrollment in 90-percent-to-100 percent minority schools rose from 6.8 percent in 1968 to 23.5 percent in 1986 in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and from 11.7 percent to 24.7 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The growing proportion of Hispanic students and the lack of major desegregation litigation `` suggest a future of continuingly increasing segregation,'' the report said. For blacks, the most segregated states are <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> while integration is at its highest levels in the South. `` We made the largest effort in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and it had the largest impact, but we're beginning to see in the 1980s a slow resegregation of the South,'' <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON> said. The most striking example of the trend is in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, the report said. The percent of the state's black students attending schools with white majorities fell by 8 percent in the 1980s; the proportion of students in highly segregated schools rose by 9.3 percent in the 1980s; and the percent of white enrollment in a typical black student's school fell almost to the level of 1970, `` before the implementation of the large urban busing orders.'' In contrast to the black and Hispanic experiences, the study says Asian students are not segregated. The average Asian student attends a school with a majority of whites, 20 percent Asians and 25 percent blacks and Hispanics.

<HEAD>Winter Winds Skim Tons of Soil from Great Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fierce winds have eroded nearly 4.7 million acres of land in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> this winter, one of the most extensive losses on record, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey. `` Much of this damage is due to the drought,'' Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` We went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> because of the drought. Then this winter, we've had a combination of no snow cover and high-velocity winds in many areas.'' Scaling said 88 percent of the acreage damaged was cropland, with rangeland accounting for most of the remainder. The <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> surveys <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> damage annually from Nov. 1 through the following May 31, a seven-month period when winds are highest and soils are driest. The damage to 4.7 million acres was through February. Scaling said the northern plains were hard hit, with <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> showing damage to nearly 1.4 million acres, about 30 percent of the 10-state total. Losses in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> have been greater than at any time since <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> began the regular surveys in 1955. Agency records go back to the mid-1930s, but figures for some of those years were obtained from other sources. The worst damage was done to about 16 million acres in 1954-55, although the old Dust Bowl probably exceeded that in the early 1930s before annual figures were compiled. But the 1987-88 season was bad, too, with more than 13 million acres damaged in the region. Another was in 1980-81 when the agency reported 12.5 million acres. Land is considered wind-damaged when the effects of wind are apparent to the eye. By that time, according to conservationists, the erosion rate has reached about 15 tons per acre a year, usually at least three times faster than is `` tolerable,'' or naturally replaceable. A loss of five tons per acre translates into a layer of soil about the thickness of a dime spread over one acre. Scaling said farmers used emergency tillage on more than a million acres to help reduce the blowing by roughing the surface exposed to wind. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounted for 80 percent of the emergency tillage, about 880,000 acres. In addition to the land damaged during the four-month period, Scaling said more than 22.5 million acres were `` in condition to blow'' as of March 1, the most in 32 years. Highest on the list are <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he said. According to the survey, which was made in 541 counties of the region's 10 states, here is the state-by-state breakdown comparing damaged acres in November, December, January and February with the same four months of 1987-88:

 A new 55-page handbook has been designed by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to help farmers, shippers and local communities cope with the loss of railroad service. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` Buzz'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the handbook contains information on rural rail assistance from a number of sources and summarizes regulations as these apply to rail abandonments. `` Many of the light-density branch lines being cast off are located in agricultural regions,'' he said. `` Without rail transportation, the marketing options of local producers are limited.'' The topics include abandonments, alternatives to abandonment, and guidelines for evaluating the possibility of small railroad operations. Information is included for potential buyers who have little or no railroad experience. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said many, if not all, of the major railroad companies have programs or plans for assisting in line sales. And many of those have worked with rural communities and shippers to explore ways of retaining rail service. This information is also in the handbook, he said. Copies of the booklet are being sent to federal, state and local organizations involved in rural railroad service assistance, he said. A limited supply is available free of charge for general distribution. For more information, contact: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Batson </PERSON>, USDA-OT, P.O.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says egg production is down about 6 percent from a year ago, mostly reflecting a sharp cutback by producers because of low prices last year. Total production during the first three months of the marketing year that began Dec. 1 was estimated at 16.7 billion eggs, down from 17.7 billion a year earlier, the department said Thursday in a report. As of March 1, laying hens totaled 271 million, down from 282 million a year ago. The March 1 flock included about 232 million hens producing eggs for consumer use, and 38.9 million producers of hatching-type eggs. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says 1989 egg production is expected to be down around 2 percent from last year because of the reduction in laying hens. Producers cut back flocks in response to the lowest net returns since <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> began estimating those figures in 1972, the agency said.

<TEXT>
 Over spicy Thai shrimp and piquant vegetables in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> restaurant jam-packed with reporters, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> exuded glasnost and good cheer. Superpower relations are on the upswing, and <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> was all smiles _ except on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to extend the range of short-range nuclear missiles. `` It's unacceptable, at any rate not for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but for the process we are talking about,'' <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said. `` It's just something which is going against the mainstream of peaceable development of the world. It's something which goes against the process of disarmament.'' His tone of voice serious, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> added: `` There's absolutely no need to do it, because we have begun in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> a historic process of reducing forces, unilaterally by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and multilaterally in negotiations.'' In any event, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will not modernize its own battlefield nuclear weapons. `` We are strongly in favor of beginning negotiations to eliminate this class of weapons, too,'' he said. Indeed, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is on a disarmament offensive, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies are caught up in the process. A treaty in 1987 banned all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Negotiations have begun in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to reduce tanks, antiaircraft artillery and possibly other conventional armor in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is unilaterally cutting Soviet defense spending, withdrawing six tank divisions from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and has announced a projected reduction of 500,000 troops overall. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> fielded questions with ease after reading a prepared, boilerplate speech. English is his fourth or fifth language, but <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> needed only occasional help from an interpreter. And when he was done, he gave an interview in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> to a journalist from <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> for good measure. Soviet news conferences, here and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, have become a frequent occurrence. A few weeks ago, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> called in American reporters at the Soviet embassy and answered their questions for nearly two hours. At the session Thursday at the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> restaurant, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said the Soviets would be willing to reduce their military aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ a bone in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> throat _ as part of a peaceful settlement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He said Jews were free to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, or to return, if they wished, and even leave again. Perhaps, he suggested with a smile, they were coming and going `` for the love of travel.'' <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> accepts as a `` reality'' the growing union in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said his government wants to develop `` a normal relationship'' with the 12-country community. And he declined to criticize the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for delaying a resumption of negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles. `` The delay is a delay,'' he said. `` It's absolutely clear. But we understand the new administration needs some time to get things together. It's understandable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plan to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lance missiles more powerful also is running into obstacles within the Western alliance. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, with support from some other allied leaders, is seeking a delay. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is determined to go ahead, but still has to convince <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose chance for re-election next year may hinge on the missile issue in a country where disarmament forces are strong. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is unlikely to fund the modernization with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on the fence. Soviet criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plan could deepen the division within the alliance. Whatever the outcome, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said the Soviets would not modernize their own battlefield nuclear weapons. The ambassador spoke with the confidence of a government that seems to believe momentum is on its side.

<HEAD>Quayle Endorses `Brilliant Pebbles' Defense Missile Technology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has become the administration advocate for the strategic defense concept known as `` brilliant pebbles,'' a method of seeding outer space with satellites that track and destroy missiles. In a speech Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stressed the relatively small size, comparative low cost and fast schedule for development of the satellites. Cost, complexity and pace of development are among the issues raised by critics of the Star Wars program. `` In short, if tests of the brilliant pebbles concept show the promise that is expected, it could revolutionize much of our thinking about strategic defense,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in his speech. The brilliant pebbles technology relies on thousands of small satellites that would float freely in space, tracking incoming missiles and destroying them by colliding with them. The system, based on research under way at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, has been touted by the retired director of the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> program, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, however is the first high ranking administration official to speak out on brilliant pebbles. Others have declined to say whether the concept might re-focus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research on the strategic defense initiative. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in February to embrace the technology, saying it offered better performance and dramatic cost reduction over other techniques. Brilliant pebbles could be used in an opening phase of the Star Wars system at a cost of not more than $ 25 billion, according to <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>. One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, on Thursday said that while no decisions have been made on whether to go with brilliant pebbles, it `` certainly is a very attractive prospect and one that is being looked at closely.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said that despite the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s internal changes under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` I know of nothing that has occurred since 1983 that should change our thinking about strategic defense.'' The Pentagon has estimated that a first-phase Star Wars system using both ground-based and space-based weapons and sensors would cost about $ 69 billion. Critics say the system probably would be far more expensive and would n't work anyway.

 Showing <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstler </PERSON> pictures of his five children, Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> explained how each has a different personality. One son, <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said, is a worrier. `` Does he worry about dying?'' asked one of the Gerstler brothers in a quiet, small voice. <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> deftly changed the subject, and to the amazement of the brothers from DeSoto, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, presented them with a flag that had flown over the Capitol a day earlier. `` Is it ours?'' asked <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, 10. `` Where'd you get it?'' asked <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>, 9. `` Do we get to keep it?'' And so began, <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> promised, a great adventure for two children with <PERSON> Duchenne </PERSON>'s muscular dystrophy, a rare form of the disease that usually takes the life of its victims by the age of 15.

The brothers rubbed the feet of <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' statue for good luck, saw where machine gun bullets grazed across a table in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber three decades ago, and blood stains that had seeped into a marble staircase during a shootout involving a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> congressman and newspaper reporter in the early days of 1890. While on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> if the lawmakers leave a lot of trash littered about at the end of the day. `` They talk a lot of trash,'' said <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, a Republican from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` But they do n't mess the place up.'' `` You ca n't call anybody a bad name,'' <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> said, explaining how congressmen ask each other `` Will the gentleman yield?'' when they want to talk. `` We do n't say shut up,'' said <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, whose office arranged for special tours for the boys during their week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including visits to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and a visit Thursday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the Oval Office. The boys said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed them pictures of his new puppies, and each child received an autographed picture of the president. <PERSON> Angelee </PERSON> was given a stick pin with the presidential crest. The boys got tie clips. They gave the president a picture taken from above, of children in one of their schools lined up to spell `` Drug Free,'' and stories from <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angelee </PERSON>'s fellow third graders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked them about their tour of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, sponsored by the non-profit `` A Wish for Wings'' in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which helps children with life-threatening illness live out a wish that would otherwise have been financially impossible. `` Meeting the president was an extra bonus,'' said the boys' mother as the family shivered outside the White House in chilly weather and no coats `` We were really thrilled,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gerstler </PERSON> said the family had expected warmer weather, and the jackets they had brought were n't dressy enough for the White House. She said the trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was the boys' first choice for their Wish with <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION>, ahead of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and all the Nintendo games ever made. The boys are A students with a big interest in social studies, she said.. `` I like the building,'' <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> said of the Capitol `` It's big. I like the statues, all of the detail.''

 Free enterprise has collided with the Academy Awards, and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces. With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $ 10,000 and a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> is scrambling to make sure <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>'s golden sheen is n't tarnished by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> hucksterism. `` If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, you risk having your trademark become public domain,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the Academy's executive administrator, in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter. But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism, this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed with <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, Coca-Cola Classic and other <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> beverages. When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditorium and the celebrities tumble out, the <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> logo will be on display in front of an audience that includes millions around the world. `` It seemed like a good marketing opportunity,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleser </PERSON>. `` The Academy approached our local bottler in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people.'' But even as the Academy embraces this new intrusion of merchandising, it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a blemishing of the Oscar name. When <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, the distributor of `` Rain Man,'' published newspaper advertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harsh statement condemning <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s promotional gamble. After the ads appeared, `` Rain Man'' collected nine nominations. `` We regard this as a serious matter, and we have communicated our concern,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, president of the Academy. For nearly 50 years, the Academy has maintained strict security around both the nominations and the award winners. It also has envisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon. So auctioning the Oscar has greatly distressed the Academy. The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's `` An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>'' -LRB- $ 15,760 -RRB-, <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>'s best actor prize for 1954's `` On the Waterfront'' -LRB- $ 13,000 -RRB- and the black and white interior decoration Oscar for 1941's `` How Green Was My Valley'' -LRB- $ 17,715 -RRB-. None were sold by the original recipients; heirs or friends who had later received the trophies put them on the block. When <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Willits </PERSON>, the book store's owner, announced that he would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for `` Around the World in 80 Days,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> said enough, initiating a court action that, for now, has blocked any future trophy sales. The Academy insists that a contract signed by <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the Academy for a nominal fee. `` But now that the word is out that these awards are worth $ 10,000 to $ 50,000, people are reluctant to sell them back to the Academy for $ 10,'' <PERSON> Willits </PERSON> said. `` The Academy has created something of great value here. This is the most famous award in the world _ the most instantly recognizable award. The Nobel Prize might be a greater honor, but people know more about what an Academy Award looks like. `` And they're very limited, too. There's not too many of them around. ... Twenty years ago, you would n't have a movie poster in your living room unless you were a college student. Now, you can go into <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> homes and there's a movie poster, and the darn thing's worth $ 10,000 or $ 20,000 dollars.'' When the Academy won a court order temporarily blocking future auctions, <PERSON> Willits </PERSON> decided to sell his store. `` It seemed to be the final straw. I do n't like lawsuits,'' he said. `` I'm getting older and I'd like to write movie scripts.'' Yet the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> has lost its most recent attempt to save its trophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought against the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> was dismissed March 16 in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> federal court. The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed and built by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Creative House Promotions, was `` practically identical'' to the Oscar. The court found otherwise.

 <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>' discoveries in the New World brought riches to this ancient city in southern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Five centuries later, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> is doing it again. This time it is Expo'92, an exhibition commemorating <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION>' voyages It will run for six months and end on Oct. 12, 1992, 500 years to the day the explorer reached land in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Expo'92 is a gamble by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s Socialist government to catapult one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most beautiful and most neglected cities into the 21st century. On an island across the <LOCATION> Guadalquivir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the old city's narrow streets and shaded patios, construction workers labor under a warm sun to transform about 600 acres of largely barren space into the biggest international exposition ever held The monastery where <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>' remains were once buried is being restored as the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Royal Pavillion, where King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> expects to greet dignitaries from the 88 countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that have signed up to take part in Expo'92. A new railroad station will be built on the tracks that run by the site and a bullet train will carry passengers to the exhibition in half the three hours' time it takes now. But right now <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> is snarled in traffic as work progresses on dozens of new bridges, roads and other public works that must be completed by opening day, April 20, 1992. In addition to the $ 922 million the government has budgeted for administrative costs and on-site construction, authorities will pour an estimated $ 5.6 billion into public works projects to improve roads, railways and airports throughout southern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> is going to have a difficult time, because it's a small city for so much construction,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON>, who coordinates public works funded by the regional Andalusian government. `` We've got to ask residents for patience and compassion because after 1992 this is going to be the most important city in southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> added. The government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, has billed Expo'92 as the starting point for the city's economic renaissance <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON>, the Andalusian autonomous regional tax commissioner and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Expo </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> '92 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of administrators, said the project is expected to break even on the proceeds from entry fees, royalties, pavillion rental and sponsors' contributions. Once the administrative capital of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s overseas empire, <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> now presides over <LOCATION> Andalusia </LOCATION>, the country's poorest region, where unemployment runs at about 30 percent compared to the national jobless rate of 18.7 percent. A recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> estimated the exhibition will generate 130,000 construction jobs over the next four years. About 7,000 other people will be needed to keep Expo'92 running. Forty million people are expected to visit the exhibition, which will leave <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> with an Olympic stadium, a communications center, a huge municipal park, several theaters and hundreds of new buildings that organizers hope will house a research and development complex. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> will be the host of the 1992 Summer Olympics. Six high technology companies _ <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Alcatel </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Telefonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espana </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> _ have signed contracts to convert their pavillions into research and development and job-training centers after the fair ends. The Expo'92 <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has what it calls the `` 1993 Plan,'' a post-exhibition project to cut travel time between <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> and the coastal resort areas of <LOCATION> Malaga </LOCATION> to the southeast, <LOCATION> Huelva </LOCATION> to the southwest, and <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION> to the south, rather than massive investments in hotels in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> itself. The number of hotel beds in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> will be doubled, however. `` It's better to improve communication with the <LOCATION> Huelva </LOCATION> coast, which will be 45 minutes away, than build hotels in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> that are forced to close in 1993,'' said <PERSON> Jacinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellon </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> Expo </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> '92 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Three luxury hotels are planned for the Expo'92 site, along with an `` Expo City'' of residential units for people who come here to set up the exhibitions Expo'92 project has not missed any construction deadlines so far, and public works coordinator <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said contracts called for all the major public works to be finished on time. But <PERSON> Pellon </PERSON> said poor administrative coordination has held up approval of <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sevilla </LOCATION>, a private, $ 69.6-million complex that includes a civic center, 300-room hotel, a marina and shopping center on about 40 acres of public land along the river. <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevilla </PERSON>'s managing director, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moya </PERSON>, said if the city and central governments do not approve the development by May 1 investors will reconsider the project. Among the investors is Management Resources of <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which has pledged a 33-percent stake.

<HEAD>Once A Rising Star, Philadelphia Mayor Faces Big Problems</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s birthplace has big problems, and its mayor, once mentioned as a potential vice president, is taking the heat. Residents complain about too few police, too many dirty streets and reduced services. They blame Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, whom they have forced to back off from a proposed $ 70 million tax increase. Even a political ally admits the mayor `` has been a disappoinment.'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> was mentioned as a vice presidential possibility in 1984 by Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. But that was before the 1985 debacle in which 11 people were killed when police, with <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>'s go-ahead, confronted the radical MOVE group and forever damaged the mayor's image. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> has insisted that things in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> are not as bad as critics claim. But last week, he abruptly halted a telephone interview on the first question when asked if the city was in trouble. `` I do n't want to talk about it,'' he said. `` Just say the mayor does n't want to comment.'' Challenges remain for <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, the first black mayor in the nation's fifth-largest city, who is nearly halfway through his second four-year term. Fresh off reversing the city's commitment to a new courthouse-jail complex after spending $ 30 million on it, <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> faces the wrath of the city's legal community and a federal court order to relieve prison crowding. Forced by public pressure to back off the tax increase, <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> is trying to put together a budget amid projections of a $ 100 million deficit and the clamor for more services. Even a special <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> appointed by <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> rebuffed the mayor's tax proposal. `` I thought it would be a whitewash and it was n't. That in itself indicates the severity of the problem,'' said <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON>, the senior Republican in <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Many contend <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> has n't been a good manager, and even supporters such as <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mezvinsky </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democratic chairman and co-chairman of <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>'s 1987 re-election campaign, acknowledge his political dilemma. `` He's got to take unpopular positions because there is a lot less money available,'' <PERSON> Mezvinsky </PERSON> said. `` The city has to make it on its own. It's got to pull in its belt and cut out unnecessary services. It has to be done if the city is going to survive.'' At recent town meetings, which <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> arranged this winter in a futile effort to sell his tax plan, tempers frequently flared as citizens confronted the frustrated, sometimes angry mayor, demanding more police protection, clean streets, and charging that drug dealers control too many neighborhoods. Former Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, under whom <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> was city managing director, declined to discuss the managerial style of his successor. `` The facts speak for themselves,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. Several top Democrats did not return phone calls or declined to comment publicly on the mayor's standing. The political ally who said <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> has been a disappoinment would speak only on condition of anonymity. `` He really is n't running the city well. He is not a dishonest person and is trying to do his best but integrity is n't enough to manage, and his mismanagement has allowed his detractors to have a field day which has undermined his effectiveness,'' the <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> ally said. `` This city is more divided today than ever before. All the blame is n't <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>'s alone. Others have to share it, like the council, like the business community, the judiciary. Everyone seems to have an axe to grind ... and <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> has been unable to bring the diverse elements together so the city can be run well,'' the ally said. Republicans looking ahead to this fall's district attorney and city controller elections smell blood. It's been nearly four decades since Republicans last controlled the government of this city, which has a 3-to-1 Democratic registration. `` If you listen, you can hear people saying <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> is ready for a complete change in government and politics,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocks </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> choice for controller. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> has shown he's listening. He said recently he would hire 400 more police this year, and then add 300 more in each of the next three years to a force now at about 6,000, down from the 7,800 when he took office in 1984. Councilman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tayoun </PERSON>, a Democrat often at odds with <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, said the mayor must cooperate to get things done. `` He's now being forced to understand that he has no higher taxes in sight, that he has to increase the police, that he has to clean the streets, and if he does that the city will begin to turn around,'' <PERSON> Tayoun </PERSON> said.

 A man on a rampage with a submachine gun Thursday abducted a woman, killed her and her mother-in-law, then raped another woman, was cornered by police and shot two officers before fatally shooting himself, police said. The gunman, identified as <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was taken into custody with a head wound around 3 p.m. from a duplex in this suburb south of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> where he shot the officers who entered the building on a house-to-house search. The suspect, armed with a MAC-11 submachine pistol, opened fire on the two officers, hitting one in the chest and neck and wounding the other with flying glass, as they entered a townhouse in the <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> subdivision. The gunman then shot a 18-year-old hostage in the back, and went upstairs and shot himself in the head, police said. `` All he said was, ` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, he shot me and then went upstairs and shot himself,'' Arapahoe County Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> quoted the hostage, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>, as saying. A police SWAT team rescued the wounded officers, lobbed flash grenades into the house and found the hostage and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The gunman was taken with the wounded officers to Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he died at 5:56 p.m., said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carper </PERSON> was in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds; Deputy <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, 37, was in serious condition with a chest wound; and Deputy <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 36, was in good condition with a leg wound and face cuts, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a critic of assault rifle sales, said the gunman used the semiautomatic MAC-11, which is sold over-the-counter, and that said there was evidence the weapon had been modified to fire fully automatic. When the weapon was recovered there were only five rounds left of its 32-round magazine, he said. Authorities were at a loss to explain a motive for the one-man crime wave. `` This man is ... extremely dangerous,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION>'s Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` We have four or five crime scenes and a lot of people hurt and injured.'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> said its only record of <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was that he had been charged for second-degree burglary. But he never served time in state prison, apparently having been granted probation, officials said. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauber </PERSON>, regional vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cenikor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> cocaine residence treatment program in suburban <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had been enrolled in the program as part of his probation and eventually was kicked out for stealing, but never hinted at violence. `` He left about three months ago. We ask people how severe their addictions are and he reported he had a $ 30-a-day cocaine habit. He was a very average person. ... Not the type who stands out. He came in at age 20 and had a long history of substance abuse,'' <PERSON> Strauber </PERSON> said. `` He never exhibited mood swings here. If he had shown violent behavior, we would not have allowed him to stay here,'' <PERSON> Strauber </PERSON> said. More than 100 officers from three counties and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> joined a manhunt in southern metropolitan <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where creeks with grassy floodplains run amid housing subdivisions. Authorities said the man broke into a house in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, about 3 a.m., and a woman there called a police emergency number. She hung up before she could give her address, but authorities traced the call and found her garage door open, and the woman and a car missing. Authorities said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> kidnapped <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, 47, from her home in a burglary gone sour, and forced her to drive to the home of her mother-in-law, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, 68, in rural <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>. Shortly after 6 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Louviers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> got a report of shootings in a subdivision in <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Authorities found the two women dead, and two men in shock. <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Zotos </PERSON> said the women were tied up and shot with a semiautomatic weapon. The two men were tied up but not harmed and were able to untie themselves and telephone authorities. Their names were not disclosed. The gunman then stole a car, and drove about 10 miles to a southern <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> subdivision and pulled in behind a limousine that had arrived to pick up residents. `` He pulled in behind the limousine, apparently assaulted the limousine driver, and apparently the victim was either outside or came outside and he forced her back into the house,'' <ORGANIZATION> Zotos </ORGANIZATION> said. The woman's husband and an infant were also in the house. The gunman sexually assaulted the woman, then fled in the limousine and wrecked it a short time later when he crashed into a fence, authorities said. He fled on foot to the <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> house, about three blocks distant, and holed up with <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>. It was not immediately clear whether <PERSON> Carper </PERSON> was living at the townhouse. Based on the damage to the car, authorities believed the man was injured in the accident. The man was acting erratically, and may have been taking drugs, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` He's high on something, high and desperate for some reason.''

 It's 6 a.m. in the <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> subway station and the transit police are dividing the river of morning commuters rushing toward the trains: women on the right, men on the left. Any man found on the wrong side is apt to be publicly humiliated. `` Excuse me, sir,'' a uniformed official said to a young man joining his female companion in the women's line. `` Over there,'' the officer ordered, pointing. Morning commuters silently stared as the couple moved over. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has the only subway system that segregates its passengers by sex during rush hour, said <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Requis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON>, manager of stations and transportation. Women who use the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> on weekdays between 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. say there's only one reason. `` They separate us because the men are abusive, they like to grab the women,'' said seamstress <PERSON> Modesta </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON>, 50, who rides the women's cars daily `` Women do n't try to grab other women.'' <PERSON> Itziar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, a feminist counselor who has been sexually harassed on the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` Although the women's cars are just as crowded, and you ca n't move or breathe, you do n't have to worry about sexual aggression,'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Requis </PERSON> said the segregated cars, which began 10 years ago, are necessary for `` maintaining order'' on the subway. The modern system daily moves an estimated 5 million people over almost 90 miles of track. `` It is the only <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> in the world that gives additional attention to women and children by separating them,'' <PERSON> Requis </PERSON> said. `` This way they can travel more comfortably.'' Women can ride in the men's cars during rush hour, but men are prohibited from the women's cars. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> does n't have a corner on <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> mashing, said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, a psychoanalyst who has written extensively on Mexican male aggression, known as machismo. He said such harassment occurs elsewhere, but the fact that segregated subway cars exist only in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> says a lot about Mexican culture. <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> believes the cars exist because <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> men want to protect their women from other men like themselves. `` You have to understand that this is a society in which the woman is an object, something that can be carried away, taken,'' he said. Ever since the Spanish conquistadores ran off with the <ORGANIZATION> Aztecs </ORGANIZATION>' wives, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> male has worried other males will try to `` steal'' his women, <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> said That insecurity, says <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, also leads the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> male to try to conquer women who `` belong'' to others. Mexican writer <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> has said that to the Mexican, there are only two possibilites: being the sexual aggressor or the one who is violated. In his collection of essays, `` The Labyrinth of Solitude,'' Paz writes, `` One word sums up the -LRB- male -RRB- aggressiveness, insensitivity, invulnerability and other attributes of the macho: power.'' Few men interviewed agreed with <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>'s theory. `` It is n't machismo or a way to protect women from the damned Mexicans,'' said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, an urban sociologist from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's just a space of greater comfort for the women and children because the men are stronger.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> architectural foundation have chosen a model for 21st century urban development: <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandelsonas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> architect and faculty member at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, will spend much of the next three years studying the city's layout and architecture. In turn, they hope to teach the rest of the country how cities should grow. `` Every city wants to have little skyscrapers growing up,'' said <PERSON> Gandelsonas </PERSON>. `` And there are secondary office boxes growing up in <LOCATION> suburbia </LOCATION> without any order, producing total chaos in the landscape without any rational organization.'' <PERSON> Gandelsonas </PERSON> has studied the development of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, but he has yet to find one that could serve as a futuristic model for the `` city beautiful'' movement that started in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> during this century's first decade. That movement arose from the Burnham Plan written for the Columbian Exposition in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> during the early 1900s. The plan has served as the blueprint for the expansion of that city until now. In looking for a new city to serve as a model for urban development, <PERSON> Gandelsonas </PERSON> said he wanted a place in the middle of the country with a strong architectural heritage, a riverfront and a healthy economy. <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON>, he said, `` was a natural.'' `` <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> has a long tradition of planning, which very few people know about,'' he said. `` Des <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> got into planning at the turn of the century with <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. And throughout the century there have been a number of plans. And there's a fantastic architectural tradition in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gandelsonas </PERSON> has been working with the city's artistic, business and political leaders for several months to start the study. He led a group of 10 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduate students who spent several days taking hundreds of photographs of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. Since then, <PERSON> Gandelsonas </PERSON> said, he has been constructing computer models of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Skidmore-Owens-Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The work will end in 1992 with the publication of a book showing how other American cities can grow by following <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON>' example. Among his findings so far are that <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>, the city's major east-west thoroughfare, serves not only as a physical dividing line but also as a socioeconomic meridian for the city He said he is also impressed at the physical separation between the state Capitol and downtown <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> and the views along several downtown streets.

 Some legislators want the state to cash in on credit cards as a way of balancing demands for increased spending and lower taxes. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Thursday approved legislation that would have the state issue <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> or Visa cards for a commission. If approved by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> during the next week, it would be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. This predominantly agricultural state of 804,000 residents could reap in millions of dollars in extra revenue by sponsoring the card, said Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s chief tax collector, Revenue Director <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordtvedt </PERSON>, thinks it's a good idea. `` Every organization under the sun is doing this,'' he said. `` I have two of those cards in my pocket right now from fraternal organizations. ... `` And this being our centennial year, where there's a little more sense of pride in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> is certainly willing to administer such a program,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON>, who sponsored the legislation, said the idea came from a constituent. `` At first, I thought the guy was crazy,'' <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said. `` But the more I looked into it, it seemed it was not only legal but it might work.'' The card would have a special <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> design and would be issued by banks, which would assume all liability and would process the transactions, <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said. Each bank would pay the state a commission, perhaps 1 percent of sales. The plan could mean up to $ 7.6 million a year for the state, depending on the terms it negotiates with banks and how popular the card becomes, <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said. Such groups as labor unions, wildlife organizations and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> sponsor such `` affinity'' cards, <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said. Banks like the idea because it gives them a broader base of cardholders and more interest income. `` It's such a cutthroat industry that the affinity cards have become big business for banks,'' he said. `` It increases the number of people who want to carry these cards and all of these organizations are making money on it.'' <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON>, who believes <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> would be the first government entity in the nation to try the idea, took his proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> this week. There, a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> liked it so much he proposed an amendment to allow savings and loans to participate along with banks. The panel questioned whether state funds would be at risk under such a plan, as collateral for credit charged to the cards. But <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said participating banks would assume all the risk. The bill, approved 13-5 by the committee, calls for half the money generated by commissions to go to the state's general fund. The rest would be used for public schools, which must receive more state money because of a February ruling by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturning <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s school finance system. Using the card to support public schools would only be right, <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said, considering all the retired Montanans who spend their summers in the mountains but desert <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> in the winter for the Sunbelt. `` All of our snowbirds in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> all winter _ 1 percent of their purchases could come back to fund their grandchildren's education,'' <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said.

 A Western journalist has been prohibited from working for one month in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after he broke Chinese regulations and went to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> following the declaration of martial law. Two other reporters were given warnings by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ministry revoked the press credentials of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON>, a Canadian working for <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION>, for one month as of Wednesday, <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON> said today. He said the ministry accused him of violating a rule under which all foreign journalists wishing to travel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must inform provincial authorities of their plans 10 days in advance. <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON> admitted breaking the regulations, but those rules often are relaxed by Chinese authorities in the interests of news reporting. The Canadian went to <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s capital, on March 8, the day martial law began. Chinese authorities imposed the crackdown after three days' violence between <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> activists and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> security forces left up to 30 people dead.

<HEAD>Hearts Get The Beat After Being Zapped By Radio Waves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AM radio waves, which have brought so many songs that touched the heart, are now being used to zap the hearts of patients whose rapid heartbeats ca n't be treated with drugs, scientists said. The radio-wave method of treating arrhythmia is safer than electric shock or surgery, researchers reported at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiology </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, which ended Thursday. The technique, being tried by doctors in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` is like using a ball peen hammer instead of a sledgehammer,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zipes </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Like radio waves, alcohol also is being applied directly to the heart by catheters _ thin, long tubes that are inserted through blood vessels _ to halt various abnormal heart rhythms without surgery, <PERSON> Zipes </PERSON> said. So far, Dr. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, have used radio waves to control rapid heartbeats in 10 patients whose abnormal heart rhythm could n't be treated with drugs. It failed on six others, four of whom then were treated successfully with electrical shocks. <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said about 1 million Americans suffer from supraventricular tachycardia, which can make the heart beat up to 200 times a minute, causing patients to pass out or suffer shortness of breath, lightheadedness and occasionally sudden death. The researchers hope to use radio waves to treat the much more serious rapid heartbeat called ventricular tachycardia, which kills about 500,000 mostly older Americans a year. For now, patients who have a pea-size part of their heart zapped to death with radio frequency energy must wear pacemakers afterward, as do almost all patients who have their abnormal heartbeats fixed with the older method of shock, said <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON>, an assistant professor of medicine. But radio waves can be applied in much smaller, controlled doses than electricity, making it safer and less painful, he added. <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> hopes to use radio waves to slow rather than cut the cardiac electrical connection that causes rapid heartbeats, allowing certain patients to do without pacemakers. Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, also at <ORGANIZATION> UCSF </ORGANIZATION>, and French scientists already have done that successfully for one type of rapid heartbeat using milder electric shocks. For arrhythmia patients who are n't helped by medication, open heart surgery to cut faulty electrical connections that cause abnormal heartbeats has been supplanted in recent years by catheters tipped with electrodes. Dr. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheinman </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> UCSF </ORGANIZATION> research team, pioneered the catheter method seven years ago. A pacemaker to maintain normal heart rhythm is implanted at the same time. In the new method, also being tried in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a radio transmitter is connected to the catheter, which acts as an antenna to zap the heart with radio energy at 550 kilohertz _ `` near the low end of the AM dial,'' <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said. The method destroys offending heart tissue with only 30 to 40 volts, so it does n't hurt and can be done with local anesthetic where the catheter enters a vein. The shock method delivers 1,000 volts and requires general anesthesia. <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said the radio wave technique also is safer than shock because it does n't reset the heart's electrical activity or risk burning a hole in the heart. If the radio device can be refined to avert the need for pacemakers in those treated with it, then `` many -LRB- supraventricular tachycardia -RRB- patients may opt to have a one-time-only hospital procedure in lieu of a lifetime of pill-taking,'' <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said. Researchers also have used alcohol to kill tiny parts of heart muscle that cause ventricular tachycardia, <PERSON> Zipes </PERSON> said. Five patients in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, have been treated by having the alcohol released by catheter into the coronary artery that supplies blood to the arrhythmia-causing spot.

 Residents hope normalcy will return to their street now that a neighbor has been charged in the killing of a 13-year-old girl whose beaten body was found in his basement. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, 21, pleaded innocent to second-degree murder in the death of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON> at his arraignment Thursday before <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>. He was ordered held without bail pending a March 29 court appearance. `` I hope it will be all over now, and the neighborhood can go back to normal,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Milano </PERSON>, who lives across the street from the Golubs. `` I just hope they got the right guy.'' The <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> family has been staying with friends since a few days after the slaying when authorities asked them to vacate their home in the quiet suburb of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION> so police could search for evidence. The Golubs tried to return to their house on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> over the weekend, but angry neighbors and relatives of the dead girl taunted and chased them, forcing them to pack up and leave again. The slain girl's parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON>, stood quietly in a courtroom hallway as <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> was arraigned.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight tons of food and medicine was airlifted by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> into this capital, which is surrounded by Moslem rebels trying to overthrow the Afghan government, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. Rebels meanwhile destroyed a bridge on the main highway linking <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the strategic eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the government said Thursday. The anti-government forces have pressed in on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in an effort to bring about a quick demise of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Marxist government in the wake of the Soviet troop withdrawal. The Afghan capital is surrounded by rebels trying to oust the government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, and convoys carrying supplies into this city of 2.25 million people are occassionally attacked or delayed. The Indian supplies were flown in Thursday, said the spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules. Another shipment of nine tons of supplies is being readied, the spokesman said today from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The Indian government announced earlier this month that it would provide humanitarian and economic assistance to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is the only non-Soviet bloc nation that maintained relations with <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intervene militarily in 1979 to prop up its client regime in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15 as part of a U.N.-sponsored peace accord. Blowing up the bridge could signal a renewal of guerrilla tactics rather than direct battle in the 18-day battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The guerrillas have found it difficult to confront an army with air power and long-range missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> told reporters Thursday that the bridge near <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION>, midway between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, was destroyed by explosives planted on the span. He said the bridge was one of about 100 on the paved highway. He said three other roads, all unpaved and more circuitous, remain open to military convoys between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the city, which is 75 miles to the east near the Khyber Pass. Moslem insurgents, who are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and also backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, launched their offensive on the eastern city on March 6. But they have not succeeded in dislodging government troops. Soviet troops completed their withdrawal last month after more than nine years of intervention in a civil war that began with a communist coup in April 1978. The Soviets continue providing military supplies to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s government. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the guerrillas fired 2,000 rockets and artillery shells at government positions outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in the previous 24 hours. No government forces were killed, but five soldiers and five civilians were wounded, he said. He said 89 guerrillas, including four local commanders, were killed in the same period. Soviet-made Scud-B rockets have been fired daily from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> since the battle began, according to foreign observers and residents of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. They have a range of at least 175 miles. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had grossly violated the U.N.-mediated agreement by allowing the rebels to form an interim government on its territory. They hope the government will soon take power. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also charged arms were being delivered to the rebels from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in violation of the accord. He said many Soviet civilian specialists remain in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as well as the staff of a large embassy. `` Any attempts to encroach upon their security will draw a most resolute Soviet response,'' he said Thursday without elaboration. Reports on casualties and fighting around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> are impossible to verify from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Guerrilla headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have reported far lower death tolls for the mujahedeen than the government. Thousands more Afghans have fled recently to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to avoid the fighting, swelling a refugee population estimated at 3.5 million. About 2 million other refugees are in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Guerrilla and other sources said the government imposed a 24-hour curfew on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> to avert an exodus. Insurgent leaders said they were reluctant to attack the city because of the civilian casualties it would cause.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen Friday, while share prices fell slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 145.42 points Thursday, shed 20.14 points, or 0.06 percent, to finish the week at 31,568.52. The dollar closed at 131.27 yen, up 0.39 yen from the previous day's 130.88-yen finish. The currency started trading at 131.35 yen and moved in a narrow range of 131.27-131 .43 yen The market's key index started falling shortly after the start of morning trading as market investors began reacting to an overnight drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurokawa </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Because the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market, which has been adjusting its price levels recently, was not in an uptrend with stock-buying incentives, the drop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stocks directly affected the market,'' he said. The dollar's firmness in foreign exchange dealings also discouraged participants, <PERSON> Kurokawa </PERSON> added. In currency dealings, the dollar's higher opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed an increase overnight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where investors bought the currency after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> indicated he backed a stronger dollar, dealers said. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, in a speech Thursday before the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysts </ORGANIZATION>, said using a weaker dollar to improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade balance would result in rising import prices, aggravating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation problems. Allowing that `` much work remains to be done'' on improving trade imbalances, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said that `` under the present circumstances, a dollar depreciation is unwarranted and uncalled for.'' After opening higher, the dollar remained almost unchanged in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Friday as Japanese investors stepped to the sidelines prior to the start of the Easter holidays overseas, said one dealer with a commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> currency market will be open Friday, but most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and other financial institutions will observe a three-day Easter holiday weekend beginning the same day, while European markets will be closed for four days until Tuesday.

 <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> returned home to hugs from his mother, flowers from well wishers, a job offer from the mayor and word from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that a murder charge for which he was nearly executed was being dropped. `` I could n't have dreamed this. I knew I would be home, but not this way,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, whose 1977 conviction was questioned in the 12th year of his prison term by the movie `` The Thin Blue Line.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was set free Tuesday, a few weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> set aside the conviction, saying prosecutors had suppressed evidence and witnesses had given perjured testimony. In the film documentary, an inmate on death row for another murder recanted his testimony against <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and all but confessed to the 1976 killing of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. About 100 people cheered loudly Thursday as the 40-year-old suburban <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> native rushed through an airport gate and into the arms of his mother, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. He was presented with a daffodil lei, an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buckeyes </ORGANIZATION> cap and an Easter basket topped with a yellow ribbon. `` I feel happy, really happy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, clutching her son's arm as they left the gate. `` You're supposed to have a resurrection around Easter. I guess this is it.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> fought back tears as he embraced <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of `` The Thin Blue Line.'' Another cheer arose minutes later when news arrived that the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney announced he was dropping the case. But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who appeared flushed and complained of feeling ill shortly after arriving from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, cautioned against enthusiasm. `` I'll wait until I hear it from my attorney,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' attorney said his client's name has been cleared and that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has been vindicated. `` I'm now satisfied the final chapter has been written,'' attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said. District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that it was unlikely enough evidence could be produced to retry <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` It's almost impossible to find sufficient, credible evidence to try a case that is 13 years old,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, who was not in office when the case was tried, defended prosecutors' actions, including a legal fight earlier this week that delayed <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release. `` The easy route would have been to release Mr. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> immediately. However, my obligation is not to the media or to play the part of the hero,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. `` My responsibility in every case is to the victim, his family, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> citizens and the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was unemployed before his arrest, said he had no immediate plans, although he is mulling a job offer from <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, who was among those greeting him at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> said he will discuss what jobs are available with <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> once he settles in at home. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who in 1980 came within three days of execution before his sentence was commuted to life in prison, said he harbors no ill feelings toward <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials and gave <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and his film partial credit for his release. `` I still believe I eventually would have won. It may have taken us some time, but thankfully ... <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> was sent to me by my fates.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> agreed. `` I do n't have any hard feelings for anyone. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>'s home,'' she said, adding that she now considers <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> `` another one of my sons.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and his family planned to spend the evening at a private gathering at Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> home. `` It's going to take some time. We need time to have the family together,'' he said. `` I've been standing in a twilight zone for the past 12 -LCB- years. ... I was in that twilight zone until the door opened. Thank God it did.''

 Police removed and detonated a small bomb that arrived in the mail at <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrol </LOCATION> headquarters after they were alerted by a secretary's suspicions. `` The bomb was n't powerful enough to blow up a building, but it could have seriously injured someone,'' Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday evening. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator, said his secretary became suspicious of a parcel about the size of a box of kitchen matches and addressed to `` Police Force, Capitol.'' It arrived at his office Thursday afternoon. `` It was delivered to the mail room in the basement,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. `` When the mail was brought up to us, my secretary looked at it and felt it was a very suspicious-looking package. She said her intuition or her instinct told her she'd better not open it.'' The secretary, who was unidentified, took the parcel to state <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criminal investigators in the same building, a block north of the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION>, and the investigators agreed the package was suspect and notified <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> police, <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. `` They came over and looked at it and they called the bomb squad,'' he said. Police wrapped the parcel in a specially designed `` bomb blanket,'' put it in a city dump truck filled with sand and took it to a city-run auto salvage yard north of town, said <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. There, police fired a shotgun into the parcel and it exploded, he said. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said authorities had no idea who might have sent the package, or about any motive.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar gained ground today against the Japanese yen, while share prices finished lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, although the index started to make up some of the losses from early trading. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 145.42 points Thursday, shed 20.14 points, or 0.06 percent, to finish the week at 31,568.52. The market's key index lost 95.23 points during the morning session mainly discouraged by an overnight decline in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But it erased some of the losses later, as buy-orders from speculative investors increased when the index touched it's low of the day, said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dollar's rise against the yen also discouraged Japanese investors, he said. Trading became thin as participants stepped off to the sidelines in the absence of market-affecting news and before the weekend, <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 650 million shares. In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 131.27 yen, up 0.39 yen from the previous day's 130.88-yen finish. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unit started trading higher at 131.35 yen and moved tightly between 131.27 yen and 131.43 yen. `` Nothing was happening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading today. Hardly anyone was participating from the beginning, mainly because of long weekends on overseas markets for the Easter holidays,'' said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The dollar opened higher in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following its overnight increase in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where investors bought the currency after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal Reserve Board Gov. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> indicated he backed a stronger dollar, dealers said. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, in a speech Thursday before the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysts </ORGANIZATION>, said using a weaker dollar to improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade balance would result in rising import prices, aggravating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation problems. Acknowledging `` much work remains to be done'' on improving trade imbalances, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said: `` Under the present circumstances, a dollar depreciation is unwarranted and uncalled for.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> currency market will be open today, but most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and other financial institutions will observe a three-day Easter holiday beginning the same day, while European markets will be closed for four days until Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 Fourteen young people were heading home to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> today after spending their spring break as volunteers at a homeless shelter in the Windy City rather than the beaches of the Sunbelt. `` I knew I would get a lot more out of this than <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an 18-year-old high school student who traveled to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with the group. The 14 worked this week on the city's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which provides social services to the homeless, mentally ill and substance abusers. They spent five days cleaning, doing maintenance work and meeting people who use the shelter operated by the 80-year-old agency. The volunteers, affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, traveled by van to work in the nine buildings of the league _ former warehouses west of the Loop that were donated by several corporations `` They came here to experience another kind of life, another type of existence,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, the league's executive director. <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, 21, a sophomore at <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the experience hit home. `` I think it is something to really make me grow up,'' she said. `` I did n't like how my life is going. It was at a standstill, and I needed something to get me going.'' She said she was impressed with the people she worked with. `` I was sort of afraid at first because of the homeless I saw in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` I will look at the people at home differently now. -LRB- These -RRB- people have hopes and goals. They want to get their lives back in order.'' The trip was the idea of <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Creasy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> church's youth leader who visited the shelter last summer as a member of a singing group He said a car wash and dinner was held to raise money for the trip. `` We worked hard to get here and worked hard here,'' he said. In addition to cleaning off years of grease and grime in a kitchen, the group cleared a basement of debris accumulated during the decades the buildings were used as warehouses. `` They did a major service for us by cleaning out that area, eliminating a fire hazard,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` It will allow us to store more food donated for the homeless.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the league helps about 400 people a day. It has a full-time staff of 18, and depends on the homeless for much of the work to maintain its facilities. The league is located in an area that once was <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Skid Row. It is now a focus of intense redevelopment, including an upscale apartment complex two blocks away. `` It is not uncommon to see people lined up to use the soup kitchens, while <ORGANIZATION> Jaguars </ORGANIZATION>, Mercedes-Benzes and Cadillacs drive by,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. It was something also noted by <PERSON> Creasy </PERSON>. `` There is a great need here,'' he said. `` And to go across the street and see great wealth, it is sort of shocking to see that.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he could understand the jolt the volunteers received, coming from their middle class surroundings in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` They were in the bowels of the inner city, working with ex-felons, recovering alcoholics, and women who have been abused,'' he said. `` It was the most amazing trip I have had in my entire life,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Rubella At All-time Low, But Still High In Young Adults</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reported cases of rubella have declined 99 percent in the 20 years since a vaccine was licensed, but health officials say many people who still get the disease are women of childbearing age. Of the cases reported during a three-year period, 58.2 percent occurred in people 15 and over, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The statistics for 1985-87 did not indicate the sex of the rubella patients, but the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted that age group includes women of childbearing age. `` The continued occurrence of rubella in childbearing-aged populations suggests that potentially preventable cases of congenital rubella syndrome may continue to occur during the next 10-30 years,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. Rubella, also known as German measles, is most dangerous when it attacks pregnant women, said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON>. Though the main symptom of rubella is a mild rash for adults, it can cause serious birth defects or fetal deaths, he said. `` The real danger of rubella is when a -LRB- pregnant -RRB- woman is exposed to the virus,'' <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON> said. `` It can cause serious birth defects, including cataracts, heart disease, enlargement of the liver and spleen and mental retardation.'' The licensing of a rubella vaccine in 1969 followed a major epidemic from 1962-64 in which 12.5 million cases were reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and there were 11,000 fetal deaths. But the latest <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> figures show there were just 221 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases of rubella reported in 1988. That amounted to 0.1 case per 100,000 people and represented the lowest total since 1966, when the government began compiling statistics on the disease. In 1987, the latest year for which complete figures are available, there were 306 cases of rubella reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Though the numbers themselves are a lot lower, the proportion of cases among young adults is increasing,'' <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON> said. Statistics from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ the only areas that at the time reported rubella cases by specific age groups _ indicate that from 1966-68, the last three years before the rubella vaccine was licensed, people in the 15-and-older age group accounted for just 22.9 percent of the cases. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in its health objectives issued in 1980, set a goal of fewer than 1,000 overall rubella cases and fewer than 10 congenital cases a year by 1990. `` Although the goal for -LRB- congenital rubella syndrome -RRB- has also been reached, unacceptable morbidity is still occurring,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. There was one case of congenital rubella syndrome reported in 1988, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, but three already had been reported this year through Wednesday. <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON> said most of the rubella cases occurring now stem from people failing to get vaccinated, though there are some cases of the vaccine failing to work. `` There is some percentage of people who get the vaccine, and for a variety of reasons, it does n't take,'' he said. `` But this is more an issue of failure to vaccinate rather than a failure of the vaccine.'' The government recommends that children get rubella vaccine when they are 15 months old. <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON> said adults who are not sure if they've been vaccinated are advised to get the shot again.

 Government reluctance to make public an air terrorism threat in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is bringing new calls from relatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 bombing victims for disclosure of all serious threats against commercial aviation. White House, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials all attempted on Thursday to downplay the hijacking threat against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Still, some officials, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> in particular, expressed anger that it was released to the public in leaks to British news media. But several relatives of victims of the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> said they believe the way the government handles terrorism bulletins warns diplomatic and military personnel while keeping other potential passengers uninformed about risks. British investigators have concluded that a terrorist bomb concealed in a radio-cassette player blew up the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The relatives, in telephone interviews, criticized government failure to provide the public with information about terrorist warnings, such as the March 16 memorandum sent by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to airlines, airports and European security officials. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged the existence of the memo, but declined to discuss its contents, which were nonetheless reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> news media. The newspaper said a hijacking by three Palestinians was threatened during the Easter weekend. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied that the bulletin contained any reference to this weekend. They also denied the newspaper's assertion that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and military personnel were warned of the threat. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview published today, rejected the idea of blanket public warnings, saying that could encourage `` a lot of crackpots'' to call with threats. `` But it is prudent, and that's the existing directive ... to allow the security people to know about these things and to take ... as many precise steps as possible as relating to an individual flight,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the interview with The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. Relatives of the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> victims say the lack of public notification puts travellers at unnecessary risk. `` We do n't think they should use the American public as live bait,'' said <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, whose brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON> was killed on Flight 103. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the relatives of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> victims, said the group is not calling for general public announcements every time there is a terrorist threat. But he said that until `` prudent security measures'' can be taken to protect American carriers throughout the world, a telephone number should be set up for travellers to call to get information on any threat against a flight they plan to take. `` I do n't think that's going to paralyze the aviation industry,'' said <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Demarest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, whose brother, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, was killed in the Pan Am bombing. Some of the relatives noted that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> warned passengers of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Paris </LOCATION> flight last week of a bomb threat and gave them the option of taking another plane. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said only 17 of the 200 passengers left the plane, and 11 of those flew the same flight the following day. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, lawyer who lost his 16-year-old daughter <PERSON> Melina </PERSON> in the Pan Am explosion, said present security policies amount to a selective warning system. `` What happens when this information is kept secret and yet is passed around to literally thousands of security people is that it is bound to leak out and hurt the credibility of security,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. `` It then tends to sow panic even among those not directly threatened.'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aviation consultant, said if all threats were made public, they might become so commonplace that people would simply ignore them. `` With 600 or so threats a year, you'd be crying wolf all the time,'' he said. Officials say all but a handful of threats are hoaxes. Meanwhile, authorities in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> said security had been tightened after they received the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> warning, but authorities in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> reported no additional precautions. `` Travellers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers should be confident that all reasonable precautions are being taken to ensure that the highest level of security exists,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said in its statement Thursday. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the unauthorized release of an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin compromises intelligence-gathering efforts and `` jeopardizes the lives of airline passengers.'' He ordered an investigation to find out who leaked the bulletin.

 President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said he would accept peace talks with leftist rebels but warned of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war. `` We are willing to open doors to the guerrillas to incorporate them in the Salvadoran democratic process,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, the victor in Sunday's presidential election. `` We are willing to work with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> added in remarks made available Thursday, `` but this partnership must be based upon mutual respect and working together, not as an imposition.'' Although President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> congratulated <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> on his victory, some congressmen have said his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> party, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, should demonstrate it has become a democratic institution before more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid is provided. Human rights groups, diplomats and others have linked <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> to far-rightist death squads. The Salvadoran government has been the biggest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid this decade, receiving more than $ 3.5 billion. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> now provides $ 500 million a year in aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The president-elect said the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> `` must interpret for the first time the feelings of the great majority of Salvadorans, that they no longer want violence, that they want peace. `` If the guerrillas want to solve the Salvadoran people's problems, they must come and express themselves publicly and peacefully so that the people can judge whether what they offer is valuable or not,'' he said He made no specific proposals for talks, however. Before the elections, rebels asked for a six-month postponement to give them time to participate. The government and <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> both objected to the plan, and peace talks never got under way. According to the final results, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> won with 54 percent of the vote in an election boycotted by the rebels. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, also of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, was proclaimed vice president-elect. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, received 36 percent of the vote. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, suffering from terminal cancer, by law could not run for re-election. More than 1.8 million Salvadorans were registered to vote, and turnout was 52 percent, election officials said. In his remarks Wednesday, <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON> also said his administration would oppose direct intervention by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in the nine-year civil war. The conflict has killed more than 70,000 people, most of them civilians. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> was linked in the early 1980s to extreme-rightist death squads blamed for the murders of tens of thousands of suspected leftists. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> once called Arena founder <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON> a `` pathological killer.'' However, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> contends his candidacy shows his party has moderated its views. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said neither he nor his party are `` anti-North American.'' But he said `` if they want us to respect the democracies of other countries, we expect that other countries respect the Salvadoran democracy.''

 Children who are accident prone will probably change, and likely need n't worry about suffering mishaps and injuries for the rest of their lives, suggests a new study of more than 50,000 school children. Also, the tendency to be accident prone may be preventable, since it could result from foreseeable stresses _ growth spurts, family disagreements, school pressures _ that are a typical part of growing up, the study suggested. `` That is very good and optimistic news for parents, for teachers, for injury control specialists and for pediatricians,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Widome </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Accident and Poison Prevention for the American <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>. `` It means that we can look at psychological and environmental influences that can warn us of increased risk and even things we can change to decrease the risk,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday. The study looked at 54,874 school children ages 6 to 18 over a three-year period in a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, school district. Researchers recorded 8,429 injuries during school hours that were serious enough to require a doctor's attention, to cause school absence or to restrict sports participation. Seventeen percent of the injuries occurred to 1 percent of the children, a significantly higher rate than could be expected from chance alone, the researchers said in the March issue of the American Journal of Diseases of Children. There were 574 children who suffered two or more injuries in a single year, but only 15 youngsters suffered one or more injuries in all three years, the researchers said. `` Most sustained only two injuries, and the vast majority of injuries were clustered within a short time,'' said the researchers, Dr. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobolewski </PERSON> of the Tucson Unified School District. Injuries were most likely to recur among junior high school boys, children engaged in athletic activities and youngsters attending schools with longer hours or those that had alternative programs, such as `` open'' classrooms or `` magnet'' curriculums, the researchers said. `` Only an extraordinarily small group of children _ perhaps as few as three in 10,000 _ seem to maintain an inordinate risk of injury over an extended period of years,'' the researchers said. The study did n't cover why some children seemed to have clusters of injuries, but the researchers theorized that stresses such as family or social problems, or the onset of adolescence, could cause the temporary accident proneness. More study could lead to ways to prevent accidents in such children, they said. The study `` supports the widely held belief that there is not a stable inborn personality trait called accident-proneness, that accident-proneness is probably a state rather than a trait,'' he said from <LOCATION> Hershey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where he an associate professor at <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` States are something you have for a period of time, such as when you're upset, you're having trouble in school, you're going through puberty,'' he said. `` A trait is something you have all your life.'' <PERSON> Widome </PERSON> said that for most children, there are `` relatively brief and transient periods when they're at increased risk for injuries.''

 Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said the leftist government should have declared a general amnesty for political prisoners rather than just releasing 1,894 former national guardsmen. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, congressional and administration sources said Thursday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and lawmakers had agreed on a plan to extend aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, through February 1990. The aid was to expire this month. Critics have said extending aid would violate a regional peace plan that calls for democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in exchange for the dismantling of Contra forces that have fled to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. However, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan includes a pledge to back the February peace accord and eventual reintegration of the rebels into Nicaraguan political life, the sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. Through most of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave arms to the rebels. In February 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stopped military aid but continued sending humanitarian assistance. About 11,000 Contras now live in camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. In remarks during a homily for Holy Thursday services in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the cardinal said the Contras should release any political prisoners they hold now that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government has freed the guardsmen. He also said it would have been best if the government `` had decreed a general amnesty, bringing joy to the prisoners and their families and thereby contributing to national reconciliation.'' On March 17, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> freed 1,894 former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members who had been jailed since the July 1979 Sandinista revolution. The guard members served under former President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, who fled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> two days before the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> marched into the capital. However, the government denied freedom to 39 other former guardsmen who served under <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, saying they were guilty of heinous crimes against the Nicaraguan people.

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first elected leader in more than a decade and the Moslem world's only female leader, has presented the military with a `` medal of democracy.'' She said Thursday that the award recognizes the military's decision to step out of politics after 11 years of direct involvement `` We are proud of our armed forces who gave national interests precedence over personal considerations,'' the prime minister said. A plane crash killed military strongman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia-ul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> last August, paving the way for the first free elections since 1977. That year, a coup engineered by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who was tried for state crimes and hanged in 1979. Several top generals and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador died when <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s Hercules aircraft went down outside the city of <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION> Investigators say it was probably sabotage, but no definite cause or suspect has ever been found. In a nationally televised speech, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> also promised not to break faith with the expectations of the people who propelled her to power. `` We are determined to face every challenge with courage, bravery and determination,'' she said. In 1940, seven years before <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was carved from the western edge of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the nation's founding father <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinnah </PERSON> promised his followers that the days of the British <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> were numbered and formally declared independence. Pakistanis celebrated that promise Thursday in what is called <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Day, a national holiday. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was created to give Moslems who felt maltreated by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> population their own state. Reminiscent of colonial pomp, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> arrived at Thursday's ceremonies in a gilded carriage. It passed in front of tanks, armored personnel carriers, anti-aircraft weapons, long-range missiles and heavy artillery _ all on display for the ceremonies. In her speech, <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> referred to the years of military rule before her rise to power as an era of `` darkness everywhere.'' `` There was a sense of want everywhere, clouds of pessimism and helplessness were in all directions and there was tension on our eastern and western frontiers.'' <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the largest bloc of votes in general elections last November. The task before her government is formidable with a bankrupt economy, ethnic unrest and an Afghan civil war that has sent more than 3 million refugees fleeing to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> expanded her 23-member Cabinet to 41, including her mother, <PERSON> Nusrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. The elder <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, won her first election last November.

 A lobster who escaped the jaws of death when a woman could n't bring herself to eat him has found a home at the <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doorly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>.

 Legislators often are accused of dealing with pork in the budget, but pigs were among the few barnyard animals absent from the Statehouse for National Agriculture Day. Cows, calves, goats, kids, ducklings and a turkey were among the animals displayed on the Statehouse lawn Thursday. Inside the Capitol, people gathered in the Rotunda to sample free West Virginia-grown products, including apples, country ham, marinated chicken, potato chips, beef jerky and white and chocolate milk. Outside, a barnyard aroma wafted through the air as hundreds of kindergarten and preschoolers strolled around pens of live animals. `` We're doing it because it's fun,'' Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> said. `` It's fun for us and it's fun for the kids.

 A man with an insatiable appetite for cocaine killed two women with a semiautomatic gun and wounded two deputies and a hostage before killing himself during 10 hours of rape and terror, authorities said. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, was armed with a MAC-11 assault pistol when he broke into a woman's suburban <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> house early Thursday and began his crime spree. The rampage, during which he raped two women, ended in a gunbattle at a townhouse as 100 officers searched house-to-house for him. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> opened fire on the two officers who burst into the townhouse, hitting one in the chest and neck and the other in the leg, authorities said. He then shot 18-year-old <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Carper </PERSON> four times in the back, went upstairs and shot himself in the head. `` A madman, it appears, is what we have,'' said <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Zotos </PERSON>. `` We were hoping it would n't end this way, but I do n't know of any other way it could have ended. There is just no reason to this whole thing.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> died at a hospital three hours after he shot himself. <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>, who lives in the townhouse, remained in critical condition. <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, 37, was in serious condition with wounds to the chest. Deputy <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 36, was released after treatment. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a suspect in at least 140 thefts and burglaries, was wanted on arrest warrants that were issued Monday for his failure to appear in Golden District Court for probation revocation, authorities said. He had been enrolled in a cocaine residence treatment program as part of his probation for thefts but was kicked out after being caught stealing, said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauber </PERSON>, regional vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cenikor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> cocaine residence treatment program in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>. `` He had an appetite for drugs _ mostly for cocaine _ that he could n't keep up with,'' said <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlynn </PERSON>. `` And that's what led to this.'' It was n't known if <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was on drugs during his rampage _ an autopsy was pending. But Douglas County Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, `` We know he had been using cocaine heavily in recent weeks.'' The trouble began around 5 a.m. when <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> broke into 47-year-old <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>'s house in <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, authorities said. She called for help, but hung up before she could give her address. Authorities traced the call but when they arrived she and her car were gone. Her husband, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>, summoned from work, arrived at the house and was talking with investigators when the telephone rang. It was his father, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, calling for help. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had driven the woman to her in-law's home outside <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, broke in at gunpoint and tied up the three _ <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> and his 68-year-old wife, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>. `` He raped the younger woman downstairs, then executed her,'' Sheriff <ORGANIZATION> Zotos </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Then he executed the older one upstairs.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> then stole a car, and drove about 10 miles to <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where he broke into a house, held a man, woman and child at gunpoint and raped the woman, <ORGANIZATION> Zotos </ORGANIZATION> said. About 30 minutes after leaving the house, he crashed a stolen car into a fence and fled, setting off the manhunt. During their search, police warned schools to lock their doors, and told residents to stay inside. About 25,000 school children were kept in their classes. `` What do you do if the crazy guy busts in the school? And I do n't know how to answer it. It's a shame it's got to a point in our society where we've got to worry about this,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> principal. Officers tracked <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, where he broke into <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>'s house and shot him and the officers. `` All -LRB- Carper -RRB- said was, ` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>! <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>! He shot me and then went upstairs and shot himself,''' <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The MAC-11 is a semiautomatic weapon that can be purchased over-the-counter. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said there was evidence the weapon had been modified to be fully automatic. He said the gun fires 32 rounds and only five were left when the gun was finally recovered. A day before his deputies were wounded, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> lashed out at the sales of semiautomatic weapons in a nine-page position paper for the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everything I say in this position paper is true. Our officers are out-gunned by these weapons of war. These guns are designed to kill and maim people,'' he said.

 A sheriff who had written a position paper against semiautomatic weapons found his fears borne out hours later when a man went on a rampage with an assault gun, killing two people and wounding three, including two deputies. In the paper, <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said laws should be tightened to control who can buy such weapons, and if they ca n't be controlled, he urged the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to ban their sale. On Thursday, 20-year-old <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> used a MAC-11 semiautomatic pistol to kill two women and shot the others, including two of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s deputies, before killing himself, authorities said. `` Everything I say in this position paper is true. Our officers are out-gunned by these weapons of war. These guns are designed to kill and maim people,'' he said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the MAC-11 can hold 32 rounds, and fire 10 times faster than the standard .38 - caliber pistol issued to all `` I am a western Coloradan who enjoys big game hunting and I do n't want to see anything that would hurt sport hunting,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in the position paper he wrote Wednesday. `` But we have to do something about these weapons of war.'' In the paper, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> cited the January shootings in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in which five school children were killed and 29 pupils and a teacher were wounded by a man carrying a semiautomatic gun known as the 56S, a copy of the Chinese-made AKM-47. `` This tragic event has stimulated city, county, state and federal legislative efforts to control or ban these weapons of war,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has approved a ban on 40 types of assault-type weapons, and similar bills are pending in other states. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration temporarily has banned the import of semiautomatic assault rifles. The MAC-11 used by <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> would not have been affected because it is American made. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that although the Constitution gives citizens the right to import, manufacture, sell and possess semiautomatic weapons, there is also `` a burden to place some reasonable controls on these weapons of war without abridging the sportsman's right to legitimate sporting rifles.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, president of the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said things might not be so easy. `` What happens in the land of the fruits and nuts is not necessarily applicable here,'' <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, a Republican, said. He said the tragedy undoubtedly would trigger emotional reponses on both sides. But as with previous gun-control measures, he said, `` there will be an awful lot of heat generated, not much light and very few minds changed.''

<TEXT>
 The ailing <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> received a bedside visit from four of his former cabinet ministers who are under subpoena to testify against the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president facing federal racketeering charges. `` It was a sad reunion because of his condition,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` They introduced themselves, wished him well and encouraged him to fight these ailments so he might someday return home. Mostly, they just gave our president words of encouragement.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 with heart and lung problems. He remained in guarded condition Thursday night. The former ministers were handed subpoenas Wednesday when they arrived at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and a fifth member of the delegation, former Education Minister <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Laya </PERSON>, was arrested by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents on a material witness warrant. <PERSON> Laya </PERSON>, once head of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, was released on bail after relinquishing his passport and being ordered to appear May 8 in U.S. District Court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The visitors _ <PERSON> Blas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ople </PERSON>, former minister of labor; <PERSON> Estelito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, former minister of justice; <PERSON> Conrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrella </PERSON>, former minister of agrarian reform; and <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Montes </PERSON>, former minister of social services _ also were ordered to appear in court with <PERSON> Laya </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, are charged with plundering more than $ 100 million from their country to buy art and real estate in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is free on $ 5 million bail after pleading innocent. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' physical condition has prevented him from being arraigned. Material arrest warrants or subpoenas were also issued for at least five others, including five of the six former cabinet ministers who had been scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Thursday or today, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent-in-charge of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` After what happened yesterday -LRB- Wednesday -RRB-, we do n't have any information that they're still coming,'' <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have any absolute word that they're not, but we're really not expecting them anymore. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> received a visit from Philippine Congressman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rono </PERSON>, who is a former minister of local governments, <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was working with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in an effort to prevent former associates from visiting her husband. `` These men come here to do a kindly act and they're going to be arrested?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` If Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is so popular, why ca n't they let a sick man go home? And why are they stopping everyone who wants to see <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>? <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has become her hatchet man.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has repeatedly cited national security for refusing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' requests to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The Marcoses fled here in 1986 when Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> came to power.

<TEXT>
 At least 11 people were nailed to crosses and thousands of Filipinos beat their backs bloody today as the only Christian nation in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> commemorated the crucifixion and death of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. About 5,000 people, including foreign tourists and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen from nearby <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, gathered on a rice field to watch men dressed as Roman centurions hammer nails into the palms and feet of <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and six other `` Christs.'' The crucifixions have been an annual ritual for decades in this village 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. They have become tourist attractions in recent years, complete with stalls selling food, soft drinks, straw hats, fans and other souvenirs. At the village entrance, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> posted a sign saying `` <LOCATION> Fiesta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>,'' the theme of its current campaign to attract foreign tourists to the economically pressed country. This year, the spectacle attracted seven `` Christs,'' all voluntarily performing the ritual of having themselves nailed for reasons ranging from atonement for sins and thanksgiving for favors to requests for a bright future. In <LOCATION> Kapitangan </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Bulacan </LOCATION> province, <PERSON> Luciana </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 30, had her palms and feet nailed to a wooden cross for the 13th straight year. Another woman was also to have been crucified, but she screamed in pain when the nails pierced her palms and the ritual was discontinued. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, about 3,000 union members and residents of city slums held their own `` Calvary of the Poor,'' a four-hour series of demonstrations with a march from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> toward the Presidential Palace. They were protesting policies of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government, which they say favor wealthy businessmen and multinational companies At least two more crucifixions were reported in <LOCATION> Ilocos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province and one in <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION>, but details were not available because of poor communication lines. To prevent infection, alcohol is poured on the crucifixion wounds and sterile gauze is applied. The nails are stainless steel, extremely sharp and slender and are kept in alcohol. Through years of practice, the `` centurions'' who hammer the nails have learned where to drive the nails to avoid hitting bones. To ensure the smallest possible wound, only one hammer blow is delivered to each nail. Today's rituals in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cutud </LOCATION> began with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a 38-year-old bus driver and veteran of 10 crucifixions, carrying a wooden cross over a 1 -LCB- - mile route from the entrance to the village to his makeshift `` Golgotha'' in the middle of the rice field Behind him were men dressed as ancient Roman soldiers, including two centurions on horseback, other costumed New Testament characters such as <ORGANIZATION> Pontius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilate </ORGANIZATION>, and about 50 hooded male zealots who drew blood by continually whipping their naked backs. The crowds, many of whom carried cameras, yelled and pushed for vantage positions during the two-hour crucifixions. Some women shrieked and others giggled as they dodged sprays of blood from the penitents' bamboo-tipped whips. First to be nailed was <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who was stripped of his white, long-sleeved gown and left covered only with a section of white cloth around his waist. He was followed seconds later by two other men. Then, their arms and waists bound to the crosses with pieces of cloth, the three men were hoisted up for a few minutes. They were taken down and replaced on the crosses by the others, including <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, 21, an auto mechanic from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. He told reporters afterward that it was his first crucifixion and he decided to do it `` so that I will have a bright future.'' `` My God, all this for a show!'' exclaimed one American as the self-flagellants passed in front of him. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a teen-aged tourist from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> who came with her parents, thought the entire spectacle `` kind of stupid. <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> had to go through all this and bore all the sufferings so that we would n't have to go through all this again. But they got it all wrong.'' Hundreds of other flagellants could be seen in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cutud </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Kapitangan </LOCATION> and many other places throughout the country, including vacant lots in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> officially frowns on the practice in this premonately Christian country but is helpless to stop. Most Filipinos commemorate <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s suffering in less spectacular ways, such as offering simple prayers in church. Some walk on their knees in churches or barefoot under a hot tropical sun over steaming asphalt or concrete streets.

<HEAD>Fusion Claim Generates Hope, Skepticism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two scientists say they have produced controlled nuclear fusion through basic chemistry, a claim that has evoked skepticism from other researchers. But some also expressed hope that a long-sought source of clean, abundant energy may be on the horizon. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chemistry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, said their electrochemical process has produced a surplus of energy for periods of up to 100 hours. They cautioned that more research is needed to determine whether the process will work on a large scale. `` What we have done is opened the door of a new research area,'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday. `` Our indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power.'' Hoping that will be the case, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> has applied for patents. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON>, director emeritus of the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and `` the father of the hydrogen bomb,'' said he initially was skeptical, feeling that it could never happen, but, `` I am extremely happy now because I see a very good chance that I was completely wrong.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, a fusion researcher for 14 years, said: `` Based on the sketchy information I have, there's nothing to indicate they've really accomplished anything.'' In fusion reactions, the nuclei of two heavy hydrogen atoms are combined to become the nucleus of a helium atom. The process releases a tremendous amount of energy. Fusion occurs in the sun and in hydrogen bombs. But <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said the new process can be carried out in simple glass flasks at room temperature. Heavy water _ water containing heavy hydrogen or deuterium _ circulates between a negatively charged palladium metal rod and a positively charged platinum cylinder. The electrical current drives deuterium nuclei -LRB- deuterons -RRB- into the lattice structure of the palladium. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> says the lattice structure holds the deuterons close together long enough for fusion to occur. The two scientists say the heat generated in the experiment shows that fusion has occurred. `` We took so much heat out, it can not be accounted for in conventional chemical reactions,'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said. The two said they have not measured the neutrons produced, and that makes <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> and some of his colleagues skeptical. `` We do n't see that -LRB- the process -RRB- gets the nuclei close enough to each other to interact,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. `` If they're going to have fusion, they've got to show me they have neutrons of the right energy and the right time.'' He said he and others have used palladium for years to purify hydrogen and `` nobody has seen such a reaction.'' <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> said his experience with palladium makes him think the process could work, and, if so, it `` will be very significant for our knowledge of the solid state of metals and it may be very important for our energy production.'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> developed the technique after 5 -LCB- years of research. They now are seeking a grant from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to continue their research. For more than 30 years physicists worldwide have tried to produce controlled fusion, but at a cost of millions of dollars and with huge machines and lasers. Meanwhile, other scientists said the experiment will have to be duplicated independently before the findings of <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> can be accepted. `` People are pushing cold-temperature nuclear fusion quite vigorously these days. Like any science, this claim has to be reproducable. If it is indeed there, it is quite a discovery,'' said <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Choi </PERSON>, a fusion researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s School of Nuclear Engineering.

<HEAD>New, Ultra-Modern Louvre Under Glass to Open</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of bitter controversy, a gleaming and renovated <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> museum, crowned by a tall glass pyramid at its entrance, is scheduled to open next week. For months, many Frenchmen and art lovers worldwide have been holding their breath, waiting for a look at the high-tech, ultra-modern facilities designed to turn a once-exhausting tour of the Louvre's dark and dingy galeries into sunny joy. The six-year, $ 850-million overhaul will turn the Louvre into the world's largest museum once the last of its 14 new galleries opens in 1993. The pyramid entrance will be inaugurated next Wednesday by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and will open to the public on Thursday. Visitors who once wandered in search of the museum's main entrance wo n't have any trouble finding the new one. It soars dramatically between the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>'s two main wings, is set off by three smaller pyramids and fountains illuminated at night. A graceful spiral staircase takes visitors down to a spacious underground lobby where they will find ticket windows, bookshops, restaurants, boutiques and a 400-seat auditorium. From below, the view is breathtaking: the ornate architecture of the Louvre's twin towers looms against the ever-changing grays of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> sky. Visitors will also find video screens indicating in several languages which galeries are closed as well as the best routes for finding key items like the `` <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'' and `` Winged Victory.'' With about 650,000 square feet of new space, dozens of important works have been dusted off and put on display for the first time in decades. Aficionados of 16th and 17th century French painters will probably love the newly restored galleries on the third floor of the Cour <PERSON> Carre </PERSON> overlooking the pyramid. Works to be shown there include `` The History of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>,'' a huge, four-panel 17th century wall mural by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebrun </PERSON> not seen in public since 1963. The 18th century `` The Meal at <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s'' by <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Subleyras </PERSON>, never displayed at the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>, will also grace the walls. The guards will be dressed in chic new navy-blue outfits designed by <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>. The brainchild of French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, the Louvre project was plunged in controversy from the start. Problems arose when <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> picked celebrated American architect I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> to design the project, bypassing the traditional architectural competition. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>'s design _ a 70-foot pyramid of special thick, tinted glass soaring between the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>'s main wings _ was cause for further outrage. Critics lambasted the clash of new and old, complaining that the pyramid would turn the Louvre into a subway entrance or `` Disneyland annex.'' Turning a centuries-old palace into a space-age museum was no easy task. Before the pyramid went up, teams of archeologists worked day and night excavating centuries of ruins under the courtyard. They unearthed thousands of artifacts as ancient as items from the 13th century. Some of things they found _ animal bones, porcelain dinnerware, cooking utensils, vases and pitchers, 200 silver coins dating from the French Revolution, and even common latrines _ will be put on display. They will be used to tell the Louvre's history. The museum was built in 1200 by King <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> as a walled fortress to help protect <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from English invaders. In the 1600s, the austere castle was made more livable but did not become a royal residence until King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XIII </PERSON> made it bigger to accommodate his ever-expanding court. A century later, after <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XIV </PERSON> deserted the Louvre for more sumptous quarters at <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> declined. It was gradually taken over by artists' colonies and turned into a museum in 1793.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main dissident movement today demanded the resignation of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and radical students hurling firebombs clashed with riot police to protest government plans to arm police with semi-automatic weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 200 dissident groups, said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> must resign immediately because of his March 20 decision to indefinitely postpone a referendum. `` Since its indefinite postponement of the referendum proves a failure to gain the public's confidence, the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo regime must step down immediately,'' alliance chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bu-young </PERSON> told a news conference. The alliance denounced <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s decision earlier this week to issue powerful semi-automatic M-16 rifles to police for self-defense against protesters who attack police stations and government buildings with firebombs and explosives. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> charged the decision to distribute 13,000 M-16s to police was a desperate attempt by the government to cling to power. He said anti-government forces would not abandon their drive to oust <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. `` The arming of the police with M-16s is an open threat to the people. The decision must be rescinded immediately. The democratic forces would never cease their fight against the dictatorship,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. About 1,000 radical students hurling firebombs and rocks battled riot police in separate clashes at <LOCATION> Sunkyunkwan </LOCATION> and Hong-il universities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to protest the decision to issue M-16s. Students hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police, who fired tear gas at protesters. `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who issued shooting orders,'' students chanted. `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who deceived the people.'' About 500 students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed with police at <ORGANIZATION> Dankuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Teajon </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the national news agency. Police officials had no reports of arrests or serious injuries in either city. It was the second straight day of violent campus protests against the M-16 decision. Riot police who clashed with the students were not armed except for clubs and tear gas.

<HEAD>President Says D.C. ``Obviously Needs Help'' In Drug Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the nation's capital `` obviously needs help'' from the federal government in its fight against growing drug-related violence. `` I hope that we can find ways to supplement the police activity in the area, because this city has become a high-profile city in terms of violent crime,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview published today in The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would let Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> evaluate the crisis and arrive at his own proposals to rid the city of its distinction as murder capital of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Most of the 120 killings this year have been linked to the drug trade. The president said the city needs help, `` and that's one of the reasons that -LRB- federal drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has targeted this city.'' He said he is awaiting <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s recommendations. Asked about the sharp rise in the use of semiautomatic weapons in drug-related crimes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the entire administration is trying develop a more definite policy than `` just holding up those imports'' of the weapons. The government last week suspended indefinitely imports of semiautomatic assault rifles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that one policeman was killed and another was wounded in a shootout in suburban <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Wednesday night with a gunman who had taken five hostages after demanding crack cocaine. The gunman, identified as an escapee from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> halfway house, died in the battle with police, which took place a few blocks from the home of the president's son <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>. `` I want to find a way to help protect the lives of the policemen that are laying their lives on the line for all of us ... as one did last night,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I would like to add at that point, in the enforcement side, in the penalty side ... -LRB- that -RRB- we've condoned for too long those things which we should have condemned _ in drug use, in tolerance for the drug habit, in the media of glorifying the drugs _ the entertainment media ... `` And so everybody has to think anew, including the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We are in that serious a situation.''

<HEAD>Poll Says Most Israelis Oppose PLO Talks, Palestinians Targeted</HEAD>

 A poll published today said 56 percent of Israelis oppose any peace talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Arab sources said <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> moderates have been threatened with death if they continue talking with Israelis. The poll by the independent polling group <PERSON> Modain </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezrachi </PERSON>, published in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, contrasted with findings of a survey published in December by <ORGANIZATION> Dahaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which is also independent. The earlier poll said 54 percent of Israelis favored talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> if it dropped terrorist operations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The new poll of 1,251 randomly selected Israelis dropped any reference to ending terrorism and found 56 percent said `` no'' when asked: `` Do you believe there is room for negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and if so, towards what end?'' <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Israeli </PERSON> of <PERSON> Modain </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezrachi </PERSON> said the reason for the swing of opinion was because the new survey simply asked about talks without the question of terrorism. `` Many people do not believe the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has stopped their terror activities,'' she said. In the new poll, 8 percent favored talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on an independent state in the occupied lands, 17 percent endorsed talks aimed at establishing a state in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, 12 percent endorsed talks on autonomy for Palestinians, and 7 percent said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on other issues. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> declared in December that his group was renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The statements led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to begin a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, saying it is a terrorist organization. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sources said at least seven <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> moderates have been threatened with death if they continue exploratory talks with Israelis. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that on March 17, two masked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths claiming to represent the Syrian-based Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> visited the moderates and gave what they called a `` last warning.'' The moderates, most of them <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> supporters, were told to halt meetings with Israelis and foreign delegations. The Popular Front, a <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, is opposed to concessions <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has made in a bid to start peace negotiations. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted today as saying in an interview with the Maariv newspaper that he still believes there are non-PLO Palestinians available for negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` There can be leaders in the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories who are not connected with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. There are among them wise people, intellectuals, but I am not going to reveal their names because it may bring them harm,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> vowed to continue a secret dialogue with Palestinians before his trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in early April. He was quoted as saying he would present to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` things which perhaps have not been heard from me before.'' He gave no details. Also today, two Palestinians died of wounds sustained earlier, raising to 407 the number killed since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied lands began in December 1987. Eighteen Israelis have been killed.

 A defense psychiatrist testified that a retired librarian was legally insane two years ago when he fired on bystanders and police in shopping malls, killing six people and wounding 10 others. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, 61, claiming temporary insanity on the night of the crime, was and is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and has brain damage, Dr. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Afield </PERSON> told the jury Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> is charged with six counts of first-degree murder, 24 counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping in the April 23, 1987, shooting spree. Two police officers were among those killed. Lawyers for <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> do not deny he was responsible. Afield was the first of several defense experts who were expected to try to convince the jury that <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> should be acquitted because he was legally insane. Under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law, the defense has to show that the person was mentally ill, that he did not understand what he was doing and that he did not know the consequences of his actions. `` <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> is not a <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> or a Rambo. This is a madman. He belongs in a mental institution,'' Afield said, adding that the defendant had blocked out any recollection of his crime. Under cross-examination from Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, Afield admitted that his evaluation could have been affected by the hunger strike <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> was on when the doctor examined him for 1 -LCB- hours in December 1987. Also, the doctor said some of his background information was based on newspaper accounts, some of which inaccurately described the details surrounding the shootings. Eight witnesses have testified that <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> was purposeful, precise and without emotion during the shootout at two supermarkets in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s eastern coast. The trial opened last week. The prosecution is seeking the death penalty.

 One person was killed and 10 were slightly injured when a tourist boat collided with a barge on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near Notre Dame Cathedral, police and fire department officials said today. Sources close to an investigation opened by authorities quoted the captain of the tourist boat as saying the barge was poorly lit, while the barge captain said the other boat ignored a signal. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessa </PERSON>, 28, a Portuguese tourist, was killed instantly when a plate glass window swung shut from the impact of the collision and slammed into his head, officials said. Police said the glass-enclosed tourist vessel was carrying about 500 people, mostly visitors, when it collided with the 2,500-ton barge. The barge was in a convoy of five boats carrying sand. Officials said the injured were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment of minor sprains and bruises. Divers who searched the river said it appeared no passengers had been knocked overboard in the accident.

<HEAD>Teachers' Union Threatens To Withhold Midterm Grades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teachers wo n't file midterm grades with the nation's second-largest school district unless their contract demands are met and will strike May 1 if threatened with loss of paychecks, a union leader said. `` Withholding grades from the district puts the pressure on,'' <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teachers-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It means if we do want to take action at the end of the year, it will be very effective.'' If teachers keep their grade reports from the school district, students would be given their grades on union-supplied report cards, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Associate Superintendent <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON> said Thursday the district does n't plan to withhold paychecks, which it threatened to do last month when teachers attempted to withhold final grades for the fall semester. But he said some pay will be deducted from paychecks of teachers who do n't turn in the midterm grades, which are due April 7. `` We have maintained that if teachers do not perform the assignment of preparing the report cards, they will be docked,'' he said. Teachers on Feb. 7 voted almost 9-to-1 to authorize preparations for a strike. A second strike vote is scheduled April 19. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' last teachers strike was in 1970. Union leaders said they decided to urge teachers to withhold midterm grades because they believe the district is planning to close the schools for the summer two weeks early in order to foil a union threat to strike in June. The midterm grades would then be used as final grades for students, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, state superintendent of public instruction, denied there is such a plan. `` Nobody's talked to me about it,'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said. `` And there's no way they -LRB- district officials -RRB- could do that. It would cost them a fortune.'' The teachers and administrators have been bargaining for more than a year over a new contract for the district's 32,000 teachers and have deadlocked over the issue of pay. The teachers want a 21 percent pay increase over two years, while the district has offered a 20 percent pay hike over three years.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today and said he would try to convince <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` something good might come out of this kind of discussion.'' `` I will tell him that the talks that we ... are having with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives there in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> are good things, and we'll tell him why I think they are good things,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the interview with The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who refuses to speak with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 6. Asked whether he would urge <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to join the talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the newspaper, `` I do n't know what I'll say to him about that. `` But I'll say to him that we have got to move the peace process forward. We may, by then, be ready with some specific ideas.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, in an interview broadcast today on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' program on the 10th anniversary of the Camp David accords which brought peace between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, reiterated his stand against such talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not a question of talks,'' he said. `` ... For us it's a question of life, a question of existence. The state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not be able to exist together with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state here in this small country.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to forsake the idea of a separate state. `` I am convinced that the majority of the Palestinian Arabs will come to this conviction that they have to live in peace with us, and that the only way to live together with us is to negotiate, to talk in order to achieve some peaceful solutions. And the time will come for it,'' he said. `` We are ready.'' But former Israeli Defense Minister <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, now the country's science minister, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' he is convinced `` that we have to talk to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>.'' Reminded that the Israeli electorate has rejected such negotiations, <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> said that with `` correct leadership'' and `` an honest way of putting an issue, you can change the views and opinions of the electorate.'' Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who brought about the Camp David accords, said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program that there should be negotiations with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> ultimately. But, he added, `` I think the first step will have to be direct talks between the Israelis and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders chosen in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> who have the full support and public endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>.'' In <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives held their first meeting since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> became president. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Thursday that the 4 -LCB- - hour meeting between <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee was positive. `` There is a mutual interest and intention to lead this dialogue to success,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took that view in the interview, saying that in his meeting with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` I will endeavor to convince the prime minister that something good might come out of this kind of discussion.'' The <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> meeting was the second formal meeting since talks began in December, after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> publicly renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. There was no indication whether a third meeting was scheduled, but the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief's mood suggested the dialogue will continue.

<TEXT>
 A newspaper said today that 14 days before the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency warned that people posing as police had questioned <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> staff members in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> about transporting explosives. The Independent said the warning by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was the fourth involving a potential terrorist attack before the Dec. 21 bombing that killed 270 people. The flight, which orignated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and changed planes at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport, was blown up over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. Investigators say the New York-bound plane was destroyed by a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player. It said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> alerted airports, airlines and governments after people posing as police twice asked American employees of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport how <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers transported explosives, detonators and pistols. The newspaper said the Dec. 7 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin was disclosed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> transportation subcommittee, which has been holding hearings on the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> bombing. Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on transportation, on Sunday released an analysis of 33 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletins on airline security, including one on the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> incident The bulletins were issued from Jan. 1, 1988 to Feb. 16, 1989. The Independent's front-page report was accompanied by a reproduction of part of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin. It read: `` <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Bulletin 21: two attempts to test <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> security.'' The bulletin continued: `` In an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin dated Dec. 7, 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> described ` two incidents that may indicate attempts to test security procedures of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier operating from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> International Airport.' `` On at least two occasions, individuals claiming phony law enforcement status sought information from <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> on procedures for transporting pistols, explosives and a detonator. In one incident the man asked his questions at the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> ticket counter. Apparently, no attempt was made to detain and question him. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> noted that ` the incidents occurred within a few days of each other. There is a possibility they are related,''' the bulletin said. The paper quoted the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, which received other <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> alerts before the bombing, as refusing to say if it had received the Dec. 7 warning. `` The West Germans said they had not been sent a copy,'' the paper said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials were not immediately available for comment. The newspaper said the warning followed one the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, was told on Dec. 5 that an attempt would be made to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the next two weeks. Anti-terrorist officers found a radio-cassette bomb in an alleged terrorist hideout at the end of October. The newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> issued two warnings on the bomb but did not mail them until the second week of January. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> issued details and pictures of the bomb in mid-November to Western countries and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> faces a $ 1.25 million claim in the death of a Marine who was accidentally left behind in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert during a training exercise. The family of <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> filed the claim directly with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Commandant Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, said family attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON>. The claim seeks $ 1 million for wrongful death and $ 250,000 for emotional distress suffered by <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said Thursday night that she wanted the claim filed `` because I lost my son and it's the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' fault.'' <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> suffered `` intense emotional distress'' during the week that the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> `` failed to conduct an adequate search and then actually called off the search for him.'' Under federal law, <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON> said, a party presenting a claim against any agency of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government must first file it with the particular agency. `` It's only when the agency denies the claim that a person has a right to then file suit,'' <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON> said. `` We're hoping this wo n't have to go that far.'' A spokeswoman with the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said there would be no immediate comment on the claim. <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>, 19, died of dehydration after he was left behind in scorching heat in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Twentynine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palms </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, last August and was not missed by his superiors for two days. His body was not found until December. Three Marines were court-martialed and found guilty of negligence, although not of acting maliciously. Four higher officers were reprimanded and removed from their commands. The most serious punishment was given to First Lt. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who was sentenced to four months in the brig and then was to be dismissed from the Corps. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> after its investigation into the case blamed the death on a `` total breakdown'' in accountability.

The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> sent <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON>, to meet today with Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, commander of the 20,000-member Christian force and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s splintered government <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> later met with acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, chief of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> battling for control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. At a news conference after meeting <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of seeking to `` reduce <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to ashes.'' The Syrian envoy said, `` Such a solution can not be achieved in one hour of talks.' Later, he refused to comment on a meeting with <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. With no sign of an early breakthrough, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> announced it is pulling out three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officers sent in 1983 to train Lebanese officers to use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equipment bought earlier that year. `` We are withdrawing the technical assistance team at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as part the embassy's policy of reducing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel due to the current situation,'' said a spokesman who declined to be named. The spokesman denied <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports that two of the Americans were wounded in random artillery and rocket fire earlier this week. The embassy suspended consular services to non-Americans on Wednesday. When <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Tuesday, radio stations said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> gave him a letter asking Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> to withdraw his 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders say the Syrians have failed in the peacekeeping task with which the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> entrusted them in 1976. The Christians also bitterly criticize Syrian support for Lebanese Moslems and leftists. Voice of the Nation, a radio station based in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also sent a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requesting `` American pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and allied <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militiamen control a self-proclaimed 6-to-10-mile `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, to guard against cross-border guerrilla raids on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The day after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> sent his letters, Syrian army gunners joined militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> in shelling the country's main Christian communities About 1 million Christians live in a crescent-shaped, 310-square-mile enclave that includes Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nailed down the first plank of his emerging foreign policy by achieving a rare agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to extend aid to the Contra rebels and support Central American peace efforts. Congressional and administration sources said the accord, in the works for the past month, came together after a series of meetings Thursday between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the Capitol. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to announce the two-page policy agreement in a White House appearance today with congressional leaders. Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president met with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> this morning before the congressional group to finalize the language. `` We anticipate it will be finally approved at this meeting'' with the bipartisan congressional leaders, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` They have been working on this and there are some changes.'' As of Thursday night, the accord called for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to extend aid to the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, now scheduled to end after this month, through Feb. 28, 1990. In exchange, the administration pledges to support peace efforts of the five Central American presidents and the eventual reintegration of the rebels into Nicaraguan political life. Contra supporters say the continued presence of the 11,000 fighters along the Nicaraguan border with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> will maintain pressure on the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government to restore political freedoms and hold free elections early next year. While the agreement mentioned no specific figure for continued aid to the rebels, money was to flow at the current rate of about $ 4 million a month, putting the aid package at roughly $ 40 million. The presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> agreed in February to renew their peace efforts and pledged to come up with a plan by mid-May to disband the Contra force and for the rebels to be reintegrated into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as political freedoms are re-established. All new aid to the Contras must remain consistent with that agreement, the accord stipulates. For the president, the agreement marked a significant step toward his promise of a bipartisan foreign policy and was a welcome accomplishment in the face of growing criticism that his administration has been slow to get off the ground. Reviews of policy on arms control, Soviet relations and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> remain uncompleted. The accord also represented an attempt to make a clean break from the past polarization over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which plagued President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s relations with <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> throughout his two terms. `` We are trusting the administration, and they are trusting us,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. `` I do think the administration is legitimate on this. A key to the agreement was the insertion by Obey of a provision that will allow any one of four congressional committees involved in foreign affairs to cut off the rebels' aid after November if they believe the presence of the Contras is harming regional peace efforts. Another provision stipulates that aid will end automatically should the Contras engage in military attacks or cross-border incursions, or commit human rights violations. The package also says the aid money can be used for `` regional relocation'' of the rebels. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> won praise from lawmakers for his patience and forthrightness during lengthy meetings with all sides on the divisive issue, and for his non-ideological approach. Most described <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as someone who came to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to sell a policy, but to find one. `` There's no question that he wanted to find the center of gravity and rest his policy on it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, a moderate Democrat who has been part of a group of `` swing'' voters on <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid in the past. `` He has been trying to build a policy based on political reality.'' In <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s early forays to the Capitol, he presented lawmakers with a secret 10-page policy statement that included a timetable for democratization steps in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, along with rewards and punishments the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could mete out at each juncture. In the end, he was able to secure agreement only on a two-page statement of broad goals which alluded to the need for carrots and sticks to move the Sandinista government toward democracy, but which eliminated most specifics. Much of the two-page <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy statement, which had been stamped `` Secret'' and kept under close wraps by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, consisted of broad and general policy pronouncements reaffirming democratic goals for the region. Missing from the document were the kinds of harsh denunciations of the Sandinistas that characterized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration rhetoric. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the accord `` will be a positive element that will strengthen the possibility of achieving democratization in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and peace.''

 The captain of a Japanese tanker that helped rescue Vietnamese refugees from a sinking boat said he radioed three nearby ships for help but that they ignored his request, according to a document obtained today. Survivors of the accident on March 8 say that 130 of the refugees died when the boat sank after colliding with the tanker in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. But the tanker's log said that waves created by its propeller capsized the boat which was in distress before the tanker arrived on the scene. The accident went unreported in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> until the 35 survivors of the accident arrived in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> on Monday. `` We radioed a mayday call to three large vessels between three and five nautical miles from our ship, but there was no response,'' <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawamura </PERSON>, captain of the Nissei-Maru tanker, wrote in his log. A copy of the log was made available to The Associated Press today. The <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said it is investigating the accident, the latest in a series involving the growing number of Vietnamese fleeing political repression and economic hardship in their homeland. The refugees, known as boat people, risk piracy and disaster in hopes of achieving asylum in other countries. Survivors and the captain have given different accounts of the accident, which occurred between <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Survivors said 165 Vietnamese left Long An in southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> aboard the 32-foot-long wooden boat on March 4, bound for <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. They said their boat capsized and sank after colliding with the propeller of the Nissei-Maru while seeking assistance from the tanker. `` The tanker came very close to our boat, and the waves pushed us into the ship,'' survivor <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Our boat capsized. The children and others trapped in the boat were drowned.'' <PERSON> Kawamura </PERSON>'s log, however, says that about 40 people were first sighted on the fishing vessel, which appeared to be in distress. In the process of rescuing the Vietnamese, their small wooden boat drifted behind the 239,000-ton tanker and was capsized by strong waves, he wrote. Hampered in its rescue effort by strong winds and ocean currents, the Nissei-Maru asked for help at least four times from three nearby vessels, including a tanker and a container ship, but they did n't reply, <PERSON> Kawamura </PERSON> wrote The <ORGANIZATION> Nissei-Maru </ORGANIZATION> conducted a seven-hour search, he said, and then proceeded to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, where the refugees were refused entry. They were brought to <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> on another Japanese vessel after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> granted them entry.

 Hoisting crosses to symbolize the plight of political detainees, protesters marched through <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> on Good Friday. Some visited a sick prisoner who has not eaten for 35 days to protest his detention. The protesters visited <PERSON> Sandil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> at a hospital, where doctors said his hunger strike could leave him blind and brain damaged. <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> has conducted the longest fast of 600 black detainees who stopped eating for varying periods since January, demanding they be freed or allowed to stand trial. Hunger strikers `` are being crucified for the truth,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Napier </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, told an ecumenical church service held on Good Friday in solidarity with the detainees `` They are suffering for their God-given rights,'' <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> told 1,000 people at the service, including anti-apartheid leaders and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German diplomats. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government says it has authorized the release of 580 detainees, but human rights groups say several hundred activists remain held without charge. After the service, the crowd marched through the port city's business district to an Anglican church Two men hauled a large wooden cross at the head of the procession. About 70 others carried small crosses in their hands. Some of the protesters then delivered flowers to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aidan </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Thusi </LOCATION>, and about 10 of the marchers walked past police guards into his room and sang an anti-apartheid anthem until they were evicted Seven journalists at the hospital, including television crews from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WTN </ORGANIZATION>, were taken to a police station for questioning. Their video tapes were confiscated, one of the reporters said. The Law and <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said on Friday that <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>'s status would not be reconsidered until he starts eating. <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, a 26-year-old university researcher, reportedly has lost 57 pounds, about one-third of his weight, during the fast to protest his nine-month detention without trial. He underwent surgery Thursday for an ear infection. Doctors have attached an intravenous drip to his arm, which supplies some nutrition. They say his condition is critical.

<HEAD>Strong Gain in Personal Income, Modest Rise in Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal income increased a strong 1 percent in February while spending rose at half that pace, as people diverted more of their earnings into savings, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said income rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.32 trillion last month, following a robust revised gain of 1.7 percent in January. Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose 0.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 3.38 trillion in February after increasing a revised 0.4 percent in January. Most of the gain in personal consumption expenditures, which include virtually all consumer spending except interest payments on debt, came in increased spending for services. Analysts said that was partly a reflection of an upturn in heating bills last month after January's mild weather. Spending on services rose 1 percent last month, while purchases of non-durable goods edged up 0.1 percent and spending on durable goods declined 0.3 percent, held back in part by slow car sales. Most analysts expect gains in income and spending to slow this year in response to a campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to nudge up interest rates and relieve inflationary pressures on the economy. Other government reports for February have suggested an economic slowdown already may be setting in, with declines recorded in retail sales, housing construction, factory operating rates and orders for durable goods. Last month's changes in income and spending bolstered the personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ to 5.9 percent from 5.4 percent in January. February's rate matched the savings level set in April 1986 and has n't been surpassed since May 1985, when the rate was 6.4 percent. February's increase in personal income included a large increase in farm subsidy payments. Excluding that effect, income rose 0.7 percent last month. Disposable, or after-tax, income increased 1.1 percent in February after a 1.7 percent gain a month earlier. Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, rose 0.6 percent to $ 2.57 trillion in February following a 1.1 percent gain in January.

 A couple who take in former psychiatric patients as boarders successfully challenged a town zoning rule limiting the number of unrelated people living in the same house. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the state's top court, on Thursday threw out a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> town's zoning law that restricted the number of unrelated people living together, because the town did not also restrict the number of related people who could live together. `` I'm glad it's all over. It's been a long, drawn-out thing,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brookhaven </LOCATION>, who challenged the zoning ruling along with her husband, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>. The Baers, who have a <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> license to run a rooming house, were told in 1984 that they were in violation of town rules nonetheless, because four women lived in the home along with the couple's two children. The town's zoning law said no more than four unrelated people could live under the same roof in a single-family district. Two women currently live in the home with the Baers, Ms. <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> said. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON>, said she was pleased with the four-paragraph decision but disappointed with its brevity. `` I wish they had said some kind of socially conscious thing about the need to help the elderly and disabled,'' <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, counsel for the state <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towns </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision should make communities look more carefully at their zoning laws.

 A government official said Sunday's parliamentary election will be another step toward `` socialist democracy'' in the communist-ruled Southeast Asian nation The 121 candidates contesting the 79 seats of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the highest state body, ended campaigning today. About 1.8 million of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' 3.8 million people are eligible to vote, <PERSON> Somsavath </PERSON> <PERSON> Lengsavad </PERSON>, the secretary of the national election committee, said on Friday. All those 18 years old or older can vote, he said at a briefing. The council comprised 45 appointed officials when it was established Dec. 2, 1975, when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seized power after a struggle over the U.S.-backed government in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Somsavath </PERSON> said the candidates included seven women and averaged 40 years of age. Six candidates are from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and 60 percent to 70 percent are party members, he said. He said results from the country's 4,153 polling stations would be counted by hand, and the final tally would not be known for a week to 10 days. He called the election `` another step toward socialist democracy.'' Official media has said it will draft communist <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' first constitution. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Niran </PERSON> <PERSON> Panupong </PERSON>, has cited unconfirmed reports that some senior officials may retire after the election, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> <PERSON> Phomvihane </PERSON>, who is in his late 60s, and acting President <PERSON> Phoumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vongvichit </PERSON>, 80. <PERSON> Kaysone </PERSON> has led the party since he co-founded it in 1955. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> is one of the world's poorest nations, with an estimated per capita income of $ 135 in 1985. In late 1986, the party endorsed Western-style reforms to try to reverse a decade of socialist policies. The first nationwide district and provincial elections were held last year. But a Thai political scientist, <PERSON> Sirichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirikai </PERSON>, said the election Sunday is designed only to endorse the legitimacy of those in power and convince the world of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' political stability.

 Hundreds of Christians from around the world today walked along the Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, praying and singing as they retraced <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s path to his crucifixion on Good Friday. The procession to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Christians believe <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> died on the cross, was led by 20 Roman Catholic Franciscan monks in black robes tied with white rope belts. The crowd seemed smaller than in recent years. Pilgrims were seen dragging only about a half dozen large, wooden crosses along the narrow, cobbled street in the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Because of the 15-month Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the territories, hundreds of police, border guards and army soldiers were on duty, clustered in groups of six or eight on the Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION>. No major violence was reported. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, at least 11 people were nailed to crosses and thousands of Filipinos drew blood by beating themselves on the back today to symbolize the suffering of Christ. The crucifixions have been an annual ritual for decades in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cutud </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and this year drew 5,000 people. The rituals have become tourist attractions in recent years, complete with stalls selling food, soft drinks, straw hats, fans and other souvenirs. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> marked Good Friday by hearing the confessions of six Italians and a West German religion teacher in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The Roman Catholic leader 10 years ago began hearing confessions in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basilica </LOCATION> on Good Friday to emphasize the importance of the sacrament. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, 600 pilgrims marched behind the monks. The marchers included groups carrying Canadian and Australian flags, as well as the French fleur-de-lis. A guitarist led a group of Spaniards. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberlein </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he was deeply moved to see Christians gathered together from around the world. `` You just feel you are part of a tremendous movement, this Christian religion, no matter what denomination it might be,'' he said. `` To see all colors here, all believing the same thing you believe _ it's just very exhilarating, spiritually moving.'' <PERSON> Eberlein </PERSON> was with a group of 11 Catholics who came from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to walk the Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION> and attend the Mass for Christ's resurrection on Easter Sunday A group of American Christians from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> performed a pageant along the route. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, portraying <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, was dressed in a white robe and wore a crown of thorns.

<HEAD>Leaders Say China's Educational System Faces Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High school enrollment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has dropped more than 25 percent in the past 10 years, officials said today, and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> acknowledged that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s education policies are in crisis. Elementary school enrollment has also fallen more than 14 percent since 1978, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> embarked on an ambitious program to develop its economy. `` Our biggest mistake over the last 10 years is that education has not developed sufficiently,'' the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as saying. Minister of Education <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieying </PERSON> said the educational system declined because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> failed to make education a priority and because students are not convinced that an education will improve their standard of living. He also said at a news conference that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new agricultural policies encourage families to remove children from school. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, however, the state does n't have the money to improve the education system. He called for an education tax and said tuition should be raised and schools should set up their own businesses to make money. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which used to pride itself on its free education, has begun forcing schools to set up small factories, restaurants or hotels to pay for themselves. In some areas, schools charge tuition ranging from $ 27 a year to $ 810 _ about twice the salary of an average Chinese urban worker _ to pay for books and other materials. The news conference came during a meeting of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is studying a proposal to raise the education budget by 15 percent, to the equivalent of $ 10 billion. Last year, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> spent about $ 11 a person for education, one of the lowest figures in the world. Consequently, in 1988 more than 60 percent of junior high schools and 90 percent of elementary schools lacked sufficient facilities and goods, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. He said teachers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> make less than the average worker in a state-run factory and most do n't qualify for the job. The low priority given to education has meant only about one-third of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pupils finish primary school. Of those, less than 10 percent go on to high school or college. The average Chinese spends five years in school, despite a law mandating nine years of education. As a result, there are 220 million illiterates in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, most of them in the countryside, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Part of the problem, he said, is that recent agricultural policies giving land back to the peasants have meant millions of children have abandoned school to till family fields. In addition, there are few financial incentives for Chinese to get an education, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Highly-educated Chinese are underpaid. Starting salaries for college-educated Chinese men and women hover around $ 29 a month. A hairdresser can make 10 times that much. An increasing number of graduate students are leaving school to seek higher wages outside of academia and research, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. When asked what should <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> do about the problem, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> declined to be specific. He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would implement laws to help education and that a commission was working on a reform program.

<TEXT>
 A government commission has concluded that thousands of people buried in a mass grave outside <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> were killed during <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressions, not by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> soldiers, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The commission's conclusion supports the testimony of elderly witnesses in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION>, who said they saw trucks dripping blood rumbling to the site in the 1930s, before the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> occupied the area. Unofficial estimates say the grave contains 200,000 to 300,000 bodies. Villagers in <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> broke five decades of silence to accuse <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s secret police after the Ukrainian government erected a monument in May 1988 blaming Nazi occupiers for the crime. The villagers in December forced Ukrainian authorities to establish the commission, saying three previous investigations had covered up the truth by blaming Nazi troops. Today report by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, did not mention the earlier investigations. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulik </PERSON>, head of the investigating commission, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that panelists found family names engraved on some objects in the grave. `` Examination of the archives later confirmed that the victims were ` people's enemies' charged in the 1930s with counterrevolutionary and nationalist activity, espionage and conspiracy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Official confirmation has been given to the version that in the <LOCATION> Darnitsa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> near the village of <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> outside the <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> are buried victims of the repressions of the 1930s,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Western historians estimate 20 million Soviets were killed under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, particularly during the Great Purge of the late 1930s. But Soviet officials ignored the dark side of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for most of the past 50 years. The examination of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes began briefly under <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and was revived in 1987 under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness. Earlier commissions blamed <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> for the Bykovnia killings even though villagers insisted the bodies already were there when the Germans occupied <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> in September 1941. Several villagers told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they dug up the graves on orders of the Germans. A local man, <PERSON> Mikola </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON>, discovered the bones and skulls in 1987 after grave robbers uncovered them and set out on a personal crusade for the truth. He located witnesses in <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> and won support from the Ukrainian Writers' Union and the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which is dedicated to baring the truth of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes. <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON> was unavailable for comment today as he does not have a telephone.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants End Strike Against Continental</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Striking flight attendants today ended their walkout against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, saying their protests had accomplished the union's goal of publicizing its grievances. The five-day walkout had had little effect on service. The airline, which has a largely ununionized work force since <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> took <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy proceedings in 1983, said that only a few attendants had taken part and that they had lost their jobs but have the right to fill future job openings. The <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> said its executive board ended the strike, at 9 a.m. Union officials were notifying attendants to report for their work assignments. `` This strike accomplished the objectives we set out to achieve,'' <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, union president, said in a statement. `` We have been able to bring to the public's attention the disparate treatment between the wages and working conditions of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants and flight attendants at other carriers in the industry.'' When the strike began, some of those on the picket line said it was intended to last only 96 hours, a figure <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> refused to confirm. Union leaders had said that the strike was largely unrelated to the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union walkout against sister <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, another brach of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. That strike, which began March 4, virtually shut down the airline when most Eastern pilots opted not to cross Machinists' picket lines. At <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, officials said 180 attendants refused to report for work during the job action and were replaced. The union said all week that the number of strike participants was more like 1,000, and claimed that some flights were canceled, but offered no proof. The Houston-based airline lists its flight attendant work force at 6,440. `` We feel really good that we enjoyed the support of so many of our flight attendants,'' airline spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON> said today. `` Not a single cancellation occurred as a result of the union activity. `` It -LRB- the strike -RRB- just did n't have the support needed to cause disruptions.'' Messing said the 180 strikers had been permanently replaced but were subject to recall when job openings became available and would have seniority over new applicants.

<TEXT>
 A close adviser to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Democratic governor said today he was one of the 21 investors who put up $ 5,000 each to promote a 1984 book by Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the newly elected House Republican whip. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, real estate developer who is treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the honorary chief of staff to Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that he invested in the book promotion deal because he thought <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> had a message for the public. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>'s participation in the book promotion deal was first disclosed in today's Wall Street Journal. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> earlier this week promised to list all 21 investors once he has contacted them personally. The Journal said <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Cowan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, received a $ 204,480 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> last year, but <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> denied today that his company ever received such a grant. `` Unless there is just a total lapse of memory and organization on my part, I did n't get it,'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said. `` And if I'm right, clearly somebody used my name to get a grant ... I'm going to get to the bottom of it.'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said he has never supported <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> politically and and has never contributed to any of his congressional campaigns. He said he made a $ 500 contribution last year to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s Democratic opponent, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said he has had very little contact with <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> over the years. He said he once wrote him recommending an appointment to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and once visited him in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when he was making calls on all members of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> delegation for <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> shortly after his election in 1982. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said he became interested in <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s book, `` Window of Opportunity,'' in 1983 when the congressman mentioned the project during a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a mostly Republican group of people involved in real estate. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said he invited <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> to speak at that meeting because `` I thought he had a message. At the time he was speaking out on supply-side economics and he was an outspoken conservative voice.'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said the members of the group who attended the <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> meeting split the cost of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s travel and lodging expenses. The partnership created to promote <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s book was to have received half of the publisher's profits in exchange for their investment. But there were not enough sales to produce profits and <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said all he got for his $ 5,000 was six copies of the book and a tax writeoff.

<HEAD>STATEMENT BY BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In my inaugural address, I advocated a bipartisan foreign policy. And today, we, the executive and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Republicans and Democrats, will be speaking one voice on an extremely important foreign policy issue: <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We've signed today in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> a bipartisan accord on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which sets out the broad outlines of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the region. We're seeking the same goals as those of the people of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: democracy, security, and peace. In order to meet the challenge of realizing those goals, we must work together with Latin American democratic leaders, with the support of our European friends. Under the Esquipulas Accord, insurgent forces have the right to reintegrate into their homeland under safe, democratic conditions with full civil and political rights, and that is the desire of the Nicaraguan resistance. To achieve our objectives, the bipartisan leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to support my request for continued humanitarian assistance at current levels through the elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> scheduled for Feb. 28, 1990. We do not claim the right to order the politics of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. That is for the Nicaraguan people to decide. The Esquipulas Accord requires a free, open political process in which all groups can participate, the playing field must be level. The burden of proof is on the Sandinista government to comply with the promises that it has made since 1979. And if they comply, we have an opportunity to start a new day in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also has an obligation and an opportunity to demonstrate its new thinking. In other regional conflicts, it's adopted a welcome new approach, but in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, what we've seen to date is only old thinking. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has no legitimate security interests in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has many. We reject any doctrine of equivalence in the region. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have an obligation to stop violating the provisions of <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION>. Some see violence and despair in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but I have a different view of its future. I can see a democratic <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in which all nations in the region live in peace, where resources are devoted to social ends instead of military defense. I hope the Esquipulas Accord and the bipartisan accord that we've signed here will someday be seen as the first step toward that future

 Ladies and gentlemen, I think if you examine American foreign policy throughout the postwar era, one truth certainly shines through. From President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s support for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s INF agreement, every important achievement has enjoyed sustained bipartisan support A bipartisan foreign policy is based on honest and honorable discussion and debate. It's not based on suppressing legitimate differences. In the end, it is also, I think, based on a recognition that we are, after all, one people. We are one nation. And we must have one consistent foreign policy. Today we've taken the first important steps toward building a successful bipartisan policy in Central America. If asked to summarize that policy in one word, I would say democracy. Together we want the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, as well as all others in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to be able to participate freely and fully in democracy. And now, together, the executive branch and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will work to ensure that the promises of democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> become democracy in fact. I want to salute the speaker, the other leaders here, and many, many others in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, whose dedication and hard work and perseverance made this agreement possible. They have performed as leaders in the very best sense of that term.

<HEAD>NRC Lawyer Warned Officials Against Paying Informants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Nuclear Regulatory Commission lawyer in 1986 warned officials against paying informants without congressional approval, according to an internal document, but two years later the agency paid a witness $ 4,000 for information against the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 investigator. In a six-page memo dated Sept. 2, 1986, Assistant General Counsel <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> that informant payments `` would not be on sound legal ground,'' noting that federal law and legislative history `` are all silent on the use of such an investigative technique by the commission.'' <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON> recommended that the commission either write such a provision into the next year's <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> budget or seek informal approval from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But in an interview Thursday, <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON> said he believes such payments can be made without congressional approval in special circumstances where officials can prove the information is essential to health and safety. Lawmakers and congressional aides who watch the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> say they have never heard of the commission paying informants and were shocked earlier this week when Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., obtained an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> contract detailing a $ 4,000 payment to <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, a former technician at the Nine Mile Point plant in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> accused the commission of trying to undermine the Office of Investigations by paying <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, who had accused the office's deputy director, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, of misconduct. In the 1986 memo, <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON> gave commission officials a detailed analysis of administrative precedent in other agencies showing that in all but one other case the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> comptroller general `` strongly admonished'' agencies either to seek specific legislative authority or to make sure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not object. He also pointed to specific congressional authorizations of informant payments in other agencies as a precedent. `` These enactments create the implication that such expenditures should not be incurred except by express authority or by expressly informing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that such expenditures will be incurred,'' <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON> wrote. But in a telephone interview from the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, headquarters, <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON> said such congressional approval would be necessary only if the commission wanted to create a regular program to pay informants. `` The main thrust of the memorandum is ` you just do n't go engaging in this kind of activity without advising <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or getting special authority unless you have special circumstances,''' <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON> said. `` Generally speaking, any agency that can show a substantial need for obtaining information that is not otherwise available to them can use their appropriations to obtain that information,'' he said. `` Our type of cases have been based upon a specific need of health and safety,'' he added. `` The instances that we have -LRB- paid informants -RRB-, to the best of my knowledge, are very few and far between and we do n't think we have to establish such a program.'' <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON> said he believes there have been only two or three instances of <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> payments to informants in the past 10 years. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> contends that <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> passed along confidential information provided by <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Comley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> anti-nuclear activist. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials, who are trying to fire Fortuna for his refusal to testify on the <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> allegations, say they will not discuss the case because it is still pending. One <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official close to the <LOCATION> Fortuna </LOCATION> investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> was not an informer but a consultant. But <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said in an interview earlier this week that he was paid to testify and provide the commission with tapes of conservations he secretly recorded. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official argued that <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>'s explanation and interpretations of the tapes constituted consulting work.

 Chanting anti-abortion protesters gathered at a health clinic today and pro-choice demonstrators followed as a group called Operation Rescue went into the second day of its Holy Week crusade against abortion. Police said about 150 abortion foes showed up at a clinic in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> early this morning, a day after 373 Operation Rescue members were arrested while defying a court order and blockading a clinic in suburban Cypress. There were no immediate arrests in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. A caravan of Operation Rescue members earlier passed by a clinic on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> where pro-choice demonstrators were already waiting. Pro-choice forces have been stationed at mobilization centers from which they can be dispatched to counter Operation Rescue protests. Operation Rescue opened its Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaign of civil disobedience on Thursday in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. About 500 protesters sang hymns and prayed at the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in Cypress, about 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Elsewhere today, more than 200 anti-abortion protesters in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, staged a Good Friday demonstration at a Planned Parenthood clinic, with police reporting 80 to 100 arrests by midmorning. Fifty protesters were charged with trespassing in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> for entering a Planned Parenthood center, while another 100 protested outside. Police arrested 124 protesters _ four busloads _ who gathered in rain and gusting winds outside a downtown <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> clinic, three days after a federal judge barred such protests in the area. At a second downtown site, 500 demonstrators assembled but left when they learned patients had entered through a back door. Abortion rights advocates staged a counterdemonstration. Some 100 demonstrators in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> similarly dispersed when they found a clinic closed, said police Inspector <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemisto </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, 30 to 35 demonstrators in front of two women's clinics were orderly and there were no arrests. Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was targeted as the center of most pre-Easter <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> because of its high abortion rate and many clinics, organizers said. Operation Rescue has staged many similar protests throughout the country, most notably during the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last summer. Leaders of the group had vowed to risk arrest by defying a federal court order obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> that prohibited protesters from blocking entrances or gathering within 15 feet of certain clinics. Among those arrested was <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, the zealous 29-year-old leader of Operation Rescue. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and many of his followers refused to talk to reporters. Led by feminist attorney <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> shouting in a bullhorn, advocates of a woman's right to an abortion applauded and gleefully chanted `` Read him his rights, take him away,'' every time a protester was arrested. Those arrested were booked for investigation of failing to disperse, a misdemeanor. Under <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s order, they fell limp during arrests, forcing four police officers to drag each one off to a bus that took them to City Hall. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officials, who had expected protests by as many 2,500 people, followed developments during the day from a City Hall command center. But <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> clinics were spared. Police in suburban <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION> had set up a temporary jail site at the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> race track, but it was unneeded. Operation Rescue began its blockades outside women's clinics in 1987 and since then, more than 21,000 of its anti-abortion protesters have been arrested nationwide. In the most recent figures available, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> recorded 304,130 abortions in 1985 with some 100,360 performed at about 75 clinics in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. Some 1.5 million abortions have been performed annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision of 1973 that made abortion legal for women in all states.

<TEXT>
 First lady <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Friday that candidates in this weekend's parliamentary elections such as communist firebrand <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> should be allowed to state their views freely. She declined, however, to say if she'll vote for him. As she guided a group of Soviet and American students on a tour of the Kremlin, the wife of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered a rare glimpse of her views on domestic politics when asked twice by reporters to comment on <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s campaign for a seat in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everything is normal,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Every candidate has a right to his program, to stating it, to its reasoning. And the people have a right to express their attitude to it.'' Although Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> often answers reporters' questions when she is visiting foreign countries with her husband, it was unusual for her to comment on domestic politics. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders have criticized <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1987, and last week launched an investigation into whether his views clash with the official party line. At campaign appearances, the 58-year-old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has railed against the privileges of the Soviet elite, complaining that more radical economic reforms are needed to put food on empty store shelves. In Sunday's elections, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is running against <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, director of the huge <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ZIL limousine plant, for the country's most visible parliamentary seat, the one representing all of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON> generally conforms to the party line. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was asked whether she will vote for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, whom her husband brought into the Soviet leadership in 1985, or for Brakov. `` Why namely for Brakov or <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>? We have many candidates running today,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said as she stood among the Soviet and American students. Pressed to name the candidate of her choice, she said: `` Well, elections are a secret matter, and I think it would not be polite, not modest, for me'' to state a preference. Sunday's elections are the first national balloting involving more than one candidate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the campaign has gone well. `` For us, it has great significance because it shows the practical implementation of all the steps taken so far in the field of political reforms. And so completely unusual social activity has developed during the elections, and that's excellent,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief in November 1987 for complaining that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms were proceeding too slowly and warning that a cult was developing around the Soviet leader. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who is still a member of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has alleged in the campaign that the party is using unethical tactics to make sure he is not elected. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met with 70 Soviet and 26 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students holding what is billed as a `` Youth Summit'' to discuss ecology, human rights, drugs and alcohol abuse and Soviet-American relations. The Americans, ranging in age from 9 to 19, are affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambassadors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a group based in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. During the 45-minute Kremlin tour, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> displayed her knowledge of English, asking a 10-year-old <PERSON> Fazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, `` What's your name? and reading English words on souvenirs she was given by the Americans. She told reporters she had studied German in high school and has been studying English on her own. `` I read a little better. I speak only rarely, only when there are meetings,'' she said.

 An attorney for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> says the evangelist and former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> owner wo n't be buying the former <ORGANIZATION> Nautilus </ORGANIZATION> property as a broadcasting headquarters. Reports earlier this week that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would n't be buying the Nautilus sports medicine facility led opponents of the possible sale to call off a meeting to protest <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s presence in the small community. The 158,000-square-foot Nautilus facility reportedly carried a price tag of $ 5.5 million. The two sides failed to reach agreement on the terms, said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Negotiations with the current <ORGANIZATION> Nautilus </ORGANIZATION> owner, <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, broke down after five minutes, he said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> wanted $ 2 million up front and a definite commitment, conditions <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his business backers from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said they could n't provide. Nautilus founder <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> sold his <ORGANIZATION> Nautilus </ORGANIZATION> exercise equipment company to <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> in 1986. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> then moved the company to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> after the purchase. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> WCPX </ORGANIZATION> television station, said Wednesday they had put in a bid to serve as a temporary broadcast facility for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s ministry, a WCPX news report said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s lawyers said no decision has been made either on a site or on any broadcast arrangement. They also refused to comment on that report of the <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> offer. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that he and another <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader took $ 4 million from the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, has been searching for a new site for his TV pulpit.

<HEAD>Anti-Government Rebels in Somalia Claim They Hold Most of North</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rebels fighting <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s governmment claimed Friday they hold almost a third of the strategically important country on the Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and are closing on two major northern cities. <PERSON> Abdirahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee member responsible for foreign relations, also claimed <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has provided nerve gas to the <LOCATION> Somali </LOCATION> government and trained soldiers to use it <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said the gas was now in the port of <LOCATION> Berbera </LOCATION>. The reports could not be independently confirmed. `` For some time we have been controlling 85 percent of the northern region, which is about one-third of <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, and in the past four weeks we have been closing on the main cities in the north,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he is based. Rebels were fighting government troops on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Hargeisa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burao </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and expect to take control of both cities `` very soon,'' he said. Last week, he said, rebels captured the town of <LOCATION> Erigazo </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and the town of <LOCATION> Odweine </LOCATION>, between <LOCATION> Hargeisa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burao </LOCATION>. `` We have also cleared a large costal area between <LOCATION> Hargeisa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. The movement is fighting to oust army Gen. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, who has ruled <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> since a 1969 coup, and reestablish democracy. The East African country of 5.3 million was once allied with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but switched allegiance to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 1977. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> quoted Arab newspapers in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION> as saying <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> had called in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ambassadors in <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> this week and appealed for militry support. He said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country that had provided the Somali government with some arms, tanks, ammunition and nerve gas. `` We know the nerve gas is now in <LOCATION> Berbera </LOCATION>,'' the main port on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aden </LOCATION>, he said. `` It arrived there four weeks ago, transported from <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, and 18 Somalis who have been trained in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> for use of nerve gas have now come back to <LOCATION> Berbera </LOCATION>. We know because we have our own people there.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said that on Wednesday, government soldiers in <LOCATION> Kismaayo </LOCATION>, about 300 miles south of <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, broke into an army and police armory, took all the ammunition and rifles, and went into the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>, apparently defecting. `` So another front is going to start there soon,'' he said. The rebel successes, he said, were the result of demoralization in the army and an economic crisis. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has accused neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> of arming the rebels in violation of a 1987 pact between the two countries that ended their 11-year war and stipulated they would not arm each others' insurgents In September, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> government had executed up to 1,000 civilians while trying to end the insurgency in the north. In response, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> froze $ 55 million in aid to the impoverished nation. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said the rebels were `` very concerned'' that two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military cargo planes were transporting arms and personnel for the government from <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Berbera </LOCATION> and that the Americans also were helping the Somali army with communications equipment and training. `` We do n't want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be caught in civil war ... and we hope they keep out of this conflict,'' he said. The rebels have been fighting <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> for seven years. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> is a former British protectorate that merged with the south, a former Italian colony, in 1960.

<TEXT>
 Four brothers convicted of leading the city's premiere crack cocaine ring by recruiting young people from a small <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> town as workers were sentenced today to lengthy prison terms and fines <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison and a $ 250,000 fine; <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was sentenced to about 45 years and a $ 500,000 fine; <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was sentenced to 27 years and a $ 350,000 fine; and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was sentenced to 21 years and a $ 350,000 fine. Federal authorities said the ring supplied cocaine to as many as half of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s estimated 1,000 crack houses from 1982 to 1988. The four brothers and five other gang members, who were also sentenced today, were convicted on conspiracy charges last Oct. 28. In addition, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> were found guilty of the more serious charge of continuing criminal enterprise, and <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was convicted of cocaine possession. `` Until we in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demand and are allowed to walk down the street without drug dealers putting us in fear, we will never improve our institutions,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Surheinrich </PERSON> said in handing down the sentences. Also sentenced today were gang members <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, to 33 years in prison; <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 10 years; <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumpkin </PERSON>, 25 years; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gant </PERSON>, 30 years; and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, 30 years. Jurors heard six weeks of testimony in which former gang members testifying in exchange for immunity and federal protection said the Chambers brothers built their empire by recruiting youngsters from their native <PERSON> Marianna </PERSON>, Ark. Some former workers testified the Chambers paid them as much as $ 1,500 a week to break up crack into $ 5 and $ 10 chunks and deliver it. At its peak, the ring sold an estimated $ 3 million worth of cocaine a day in the nation's sixth-largest city, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. In the undercover operation that led to the indictments of gang members, authorities seized 41 vehicles, including <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and Cadillacs, $ 1 million in cash and jewelry and 250 weapons. Attorneys for the convicted gang members have said they may appeal, contending the trial should have been moved out of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> because of intense media coverage.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said today it has found no sign of a sport fishing boat that radioed a distress call off the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coast and indicated 10 people aboard were abandoning ship. Officials said they feared the boat had sunk but they could n't rule out a hoax. `` The helicopter is having a tough time due to the fog,'' said Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` Visibility was almost zero last night, and it's real low this morning.'' Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said today that an 84-square-mile area was being searched by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters Point Huron, <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION>, two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter. He said winds were blowing at 15 mph and seas were running 4 to 6 feet. Coast Guard officials have been unable to find any registration records for a 52-foot vessel called the Blue Goose and were considering the possibility that the distress call was a hoax. `` We do n't know that this is a hoax, but there have been hoaxes before,'' Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Blando </PERSON> said late this morning. The boat radioed late Thursday that it was taking on water and that the passengers had donned life jackets and were abandoning the vessel, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Covington </PERSON>. He said officials told them to try to stay together but did not receive acknowledgement of that transmission. The helicopter from <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, arrived to help in the search but returned to its base shortly afterward because of 60 mph winds and zero visibility, officials said. Seas were running 6 to 8 feet and the water temperature was 42 degrees, raising concerns that anyone overboard might suffer hypothermia, <PERSON> Covington </PERSON> said. He said a computer check found 37 boats on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with the name Blue Goose but that none fit the description of the missing vessel. He speculated that the boat may be one of the many pleasure craft that travel to and from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this time of year. The Blue Goose was described as a Hatteras-type fishing vessel, which has a large deck area to the rear, a high cabin and sleeping accommodations for six to eight people.

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says she was an alcoholic before her husband lost last year's presidential election. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s defeat at the polls was a crisis but `` one event does not make one an alcoholic,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview published in Thursday's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. She said that on two occasions last March, both at the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> home in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, she lost control while drinking but the incidents were overlooked during the activity of the campaign. But Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was never inebriated in public. `` What happens often with men and women, though with women in particular, is that you drink in private,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 52. In February, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> checked herself into a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> clinic for for treatment of her drinking problem. She left March 7 and has returned to a full schedule of speaking engagements and is working on a memoir of the campaign. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said she hid her drinking just as she hid her diet pill addiction for 26 years. `` I was falling apart before my own eyes, and I was able to fool people,'' she said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said today `` all of our options are open'' on basing MX and <LOCATION> Midgetman </LOCATION> nuclear missiles and said he was `` not happy'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff for discussing compromise proposals. Asked about recent visits to congressional leaders by Gen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of staff, to discuss a compromise, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, `` General <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> was free-lancing.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, marking completion of his first week on the job by holding his first <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news conference, declared that `` all of our options are open'' on the issue of how to modernize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s land-based nuclear arsenal The four-star general `` was not speaking for the department,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. `` He was obviously up there on his own hook, so to speak. `` No, I'm not happy with it, frankly. I think it's inappropriate for a uniformed officer to be in a position where he is in fact negotiating an arrangement. I will make known to him my displeasure. Everybody's entitled to one mistake.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman later said <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> would have no comment on <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s remarks. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ like the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration before it _ is struggling to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear missile to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s arsenal. The idea is to make it more difficult for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to target <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, and thus deter <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> from ever considering a first-strike attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> have told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they would like to buy 50 more huge MX missiles and place them on rail-car launchers. Congressional Democrats, however, would prefer to see the development of a small, one-warhead Midgetman missile that could be deployed on a truck launcher. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, have in recent days been searching for a compromise. According to some congressmen, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> has suggested an approach in which 50 MX missiles already deployed in silos would be shifted to rail launchers, while the number of Midgetman missiles to be built would be scaled back from 500 to 300. `` I have as yet made no decision with respect to the question of ICBM modernization,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said today. `` All of our options are open. The president has not yet made any decision on it. To say that a compromise is near, I think, would be premature.''

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers today sought to force former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to testify when the defense opens its case next Friday at the Iran-Contra trial, following disclosures about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s acts on behalf of the Nicaraguan rebels. `` The importance of Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s testimony to the defense of this case is clear both from the record in the trial to date and from'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s efforts to quash a subpoena, said defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. In a two-sentence motion, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> `` enter an order'' enforcing an earlier subpoena for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appearance at the trial of the former White House national security aide. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled Jan. 30 that the former president shall remain `` subject to call'' in connection with a subpoena issued by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers and served on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Dec. 30 Defense lawyers have brought out at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was much more involved in secretly assisting the Contra rebels than has previously been known publicly. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> brought out that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally approved, based on a recommendation by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and others on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff, a secret 1985 deal to give <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> $ 110 million in covert aid as an inducement to support the Contras. The defense also brought out that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> apparently approved a plan from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and others in the government to airdrop intelligence data and recoilless rifles to the Contras for the purpose of destroying ships carrying arms to the Nicaraguan government. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s actions came at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the Iran-Contra affair, on Jan. 26, 1987 that `` he did not know that the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff was engaged in helping the Contras.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were served with subpoenas from <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> both sought to quash the subpoenas. In a Jan. 13 court filing on their behalf, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the subpoenas `` raise profound constitutional concerns. The concerns are in connection with `` executive privilege ... but also regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by a former or sitting president,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` The spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjected to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the way they deal with the president now and in the future,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. In his Jan. 30 ruling, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> had failed to demonstrate that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has any specific information'' that would make his testimony `` relevant and material'' to the charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The judge quashed the subpoena against the new president. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would await developments in the trial with regard to the subpoena for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. On Thursday at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, an <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide to <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he assumed that profits from a 270 percent price markup on weapons secretly sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were funneled to the Contras. Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON> brought him into the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms-for-hostage deal in April 1986. `` At some point in my briefing ... it was mentioned that part of the monies hat the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> was providing would be going to support the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> testified. As the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide prepared for a May 1986 shipment of Hawk missile spare parts, `` I remember Lt. Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> asking for some help'' in determining how much to charge the Iranians. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, a former Rhodes scholar, looked at the markup on a previous arms shipment and, based on that, charged the Iranians $ 3.70 for each dollar in cost to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. North is charged with lying to the attorney general on Nov. 23, 1986, by denying that the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> was involved in the diversion of funds to the Contras and by saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> determined the amount of the diversion.

 Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said he may quit if opposition parties make strong gains in Sunday's nationwide local elections. `` If many want to see <PERSON> Suleyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bey </PERSON> back in power, or <PERSON> Erdal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bey </PERSON> in power, we will say, ` OK, come take over,''' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said Friday, referring to former Premier <PERSON> Suleyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON> and opposition leader <PERSON> Erdal </PERSON> <PERSON> Inonu </PERSON>. `` I am not glued to the -LRB- premier's -RRB- chair, let whoever wants come run the country,'' he said at a news conference. Turks on Sunday will elect mayors, provincial assembly members, city councilors, neighborhood representatives and village headmen. Voting does not directly affect the national government, and <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s mandate extends to 1992. But opposition parties say <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> should call early elections if the governing <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> receives less than one-third of votes nationwide. `` This is not a general election and I would like to continue until 1992,'' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said. `` But if matters come to a point where we can not rule comfortably, I will say, ` do whatever you like.''' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s record is a major election issue. During his five years in power, the nation of 52 million people has enjoyed economic growth and built power plants, roads and an improved communications network. Trade has been liberalized and it has applied for membership in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. But inflation, which reached 75 percent last year, has hurt many wage earners and prompted a drop in support for <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>. Public opinion polls indicate the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will win mayoral posts in the capital, <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s third largest city, <LOCATION> Izmir </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is expected to maintain control in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, the second city where popular Mayor <PERSON> Bedrettin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalan </PERSON> is seeking a second five-year term. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said he doubted the accuracy of the polls and doubted his party would lose. He declined to say exactly what vote result would make him consider quitting. Respected columnist <PERSON> Guneri </PERSON> <PERSON> Civaoglu </PERSON> of the daily <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> may call general elections in six months if his party suffers a crushing defeat Sunday. The popularity of the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has declined steadily since it won 1983 general elections that restored civilian rule. The party at that time garnered 45 percent of the vote. In general elections in November 1987, the party won 36 percent of the vote but 65 percent of seats in the 450-member legislature, through electoral laws that favor the largest party. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> threatened to quit before a national referendum in November on advancing the date of local polls. Although he lost the referendum, he stayed on, saying the 35 percent of votes he won indicated he still had wide support.

<HEAD>Safety Program Ordered After Youth Dies in Highway Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The education minister ordered a traffic safety program in schools Friday after an 11-year-old boy died playing a daredevil `` game'' in highway traffic, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> died last week after jumping in front of a speeding car along the busy <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv-Haifa </ORGANIZATION> highway and trying to force it to stop at the last moment, the radio said. The `` game'' is a new fad among elementary and high school students, who also have been known to throw balls and school bags on roads, and try to snatch them from in front of speeding cars. High school students feel such reckless deeds toughen them before army service, the radio said. `` It's a thrill,'' said one of <PERSON> Oren </PERSON>'s classmates who was interviewed on the radio. `` It makes kids feel strong and the girls think they're heroes.'' On Friday, Education Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> met school principals across the country after an investigation revealed <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> died while playing the game. He ordered each school to open a road safety seminar Monday for parents and children to stress dangers of the game. `` I do n't know of a school in the country where the game is not played,'' said <PERSON> Yaffa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, principal of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayam </PERSON> school where <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> was a student in northern <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> city. `` Children stand by the road and when they see a car or bus coming they throw a package and rush into the road,'' Ms. <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> told the radio. After <PERSON> Oren </PERSON>'s death, she had the school psychiatrist hold a seminar for students on the effects of the game. <PERSON> Shai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadish </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, said children play the game to show their bravery and try to share the dangers faced by older brothers or friends serving in the army. All Israelis are drafted into the army at age 18. Men serve for three years, women for two. `` We are not talking about kids who do n't know the dangers,'' <PERSON> Gadish </PERSON> said. `` They know the dangers and they do it.'' <PERSON> Oren </PERSON>'s classmates said it was the fourth time he had played the game. One of his friends told the radio that <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> said `` Look, I can stop cars,'' and walked into the middle of the road. `` He stood there and ... I heard a real loud sound from the wheels and I saw <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> fly into the air,'' said the friend, who was not identified. He said he did n't want to play the game, but `` some of the kids laughed at me so I did it.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> says she believes there are `` chances of things improving enormously'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> if the government releases jailed nationalist leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Until that happens, there is little hope for fruitful negotiations on the nation's future, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> service to be broadcast Saturday. She is visiting <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> next week, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is not on the itinerary that includes <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. `` I have made it quite clear that I could not go until something quite positive happens and Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is released,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. `` I think that there are chances of things improving enormously in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> once Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is released. It opens the way for negotiations to start. But I could not go just at the moment until there are more signs of that happening.'' Asked what was the next likely stage of developments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, she replied: `` I have indicated that if Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is released I think that negotiations would become possible with some of the other many leaders of black South Africans. Obviously they are not a homogenous people any more than we are in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' She doubted it would be possible for tribal leaders to negotiate until <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was released. At the same time, she said she could not consider meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> leads until the guerrilla organization renounced violence. `` I think the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would like a renunciation of violence. We did not quite get that, and I do not talk to those who in fact pursue their ends by violent means.'' She continued: `` Look, we are trying to get a way through by saying that Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> should be released and should be free. This is part of the bargain, he should be free in fact to put his own view but not ... free to exercise violence. `` One tries to get a law-abiding country. Violence is anarchy. The rule of the gun and rule by force is not something I've had any sympathy with at all.'' Asked if she believed in one man, one vote in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said: `` I think you will have to have one person, one vote. That does not necessarily mean a unitary state. `` They will have to work it out.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s comments do not represent a new approach. `` She's said this for a long time now,'' an aide said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> argues a moderate stance toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can achieve more than advocating sanctions, which she argues would hurt the country's black majority more than the white-run government, and would devastate economies of nearby black-ruled states that depend on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s transport network to import and export goods.

 Five weeks before his arrest on charges of kidnapping a woman and demanding nearly $ 2 million ransom, a businessman told a university business class his secrets of success, but said he needed $ 500,000. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, is accused of kidnapping <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> on March 15 and demanding $ 1.7 million in gold bullion and cash from her multimillionaire husband. He was arrested and Mrs. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> was freed the next day. He is charged with five felonies and is jailed in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 1 million bond. On Feb. 10, as a guest lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he expounded on his success on Wall Street and his willingness to risk everything to succeed. He admonished students to never trust anyone they were dealing with. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> portrayed himself as a shrewd, methodical businessman who scouted bankrupt properties for gold-mine opportunities. `` The first key to risk is that you have to be willing to lose everything that you are doing,'' he said. `` You have to be willing to say, ` I've lost it all. It's all gone.' If you ca n't take that risk, do n't go in the business. He also said: `` In the next three weeks, I'm going to have to scramble around and find a half-million dollars.'' At the time of the lecture, a lien had been placed on the <ORGANIZATION> Coyote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grill </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> restaurant <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> was developing. Another project, a hotel in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, was in bankruptcy, and <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> had just been removed as a general partner in another <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> hotel investment. He peppered his presentation with humorous remarks to make his points about finding a risk and forming a business team to follow up. `` Who should be on your team? You need a lawyer. This is absolutely fundamental,'' said <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>. `` My attitude toward a lawyer is that I would never have a lawyer that I would invite to my home.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> was abducted from in front of her home. A man telephoned her husband and demanded $ 1.2 million in cash and $ 500,000 in gold for her release. About 24 hours later, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and state police surrounded a van <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> was driving behind a <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> shopping center, officials said. Inside, they found Mrs. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, bound and gagged. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> was charged with kidnapping, criminal confinement, battery, criminal recklessness and auto theft. Mrs. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, own and operate a $ 250 million medical instruments firm they started 25 years ago with a $ 1,500 investment.

 Space shuttle Discovery, with one of its main engines in need of repair, returned to its launch site Friday riding piggyback atop a jumbo jet. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 left <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Thursday and arrived at the Kennedy Space Center after an overnight refueling stop at <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Discovery landed at <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> last Saturday after completing a five-day orbital mission during which its crew of five conducted various experiments and deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to complete a three-satellite space communications network. Discovery is scheduled to fly again Aug. 10 on a classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission. One of the craft's three main engines will have to be replaced because of a tiny combustion chamber leak discovered during post-flight inspection. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it did not know now whether the engine replacement would have any impact on Discovery's launch schedule. Other than the small leak, which had no effect on the flight, space agency officials said Discovery returned from space in better condition than any previous orbiter. Meanwhile, technicians on Launch Pad 39B were continuing to groom Atlantis for the next shuttle mission, scheduled for liftoff April 28. The shuttle's five-man crew is to release the $ 300 million <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft on the start of a 15-month journey to the planet <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, which is to orbit <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and map its surface, was to be loaded into Atlantis' cargo bay on Saturday.

<HEAD>Report: Gov't to Review Probe Of Crash That Killed 256 Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will review a report that blamed a buildup of ice rather than an explosion or fire for a 1985 jetliner crash in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> in which 256 American soldiers and civilians were killed, a newspaper said Friday. A <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, dismissed the report in The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail as speculation, but he said Transport Minister <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> would make an announcement on the issue next week. <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> would not elaborate. The newspaper said <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> would announce the review next week as part of a sweeping program to reassure Canadians about aviation safety. In December, the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> concluded the crash at <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, probably was caused by ice on the wings of the Arrow Air charter DC-8. That conclusion was approved by five of the board's nine members, but the other four members issued a report saying an in-flight fire or explosion was the most likely cause of the Dec. 12, 1985 disaster. The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s report from <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> said it was not clear whether the inquiry would reopen the entire investigation of the crash or only review the evidence compiled during the safety board's investigation. The crash was the worst aviation disaster ever in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. All aboard were killed, including the 248 troops heading home to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, after peacekeeping duties in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and eight American crew members. <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> had announced early this month that he accepted the board's majority conclusion and said a judicial review would not be necessary. However, an internal ministry report that appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> rejected the majority conclusion and said the investigation had focused on a `` pre-conceived'' icing theory. The Globe and Mail also said Friday the program to be announced by <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> would include a promise to terminate the safety board quickly and replace it with a new agency to review all types of transportation accidents. It long has been believed that the government would replace the safety board with a more comprehensive agency along the lines of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The board had been formed in 1984 so that an independent agency would investigate air accidents rather than <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>. The Globe and Mail's report said <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> also would appoint a task force to examine the ministry's internal operations and its efforts to cope with air congestion and the strained air traffic control system. On March 10, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28 jet crashed near <LOCATION> Dryden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, killing 24 people in the first fatal crash of a regularly scheduled commercial flight in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 10 years.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> ordered a review today of a controversial proposed dam and reservoir in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, a move said by agency officials to be a first step in killing the project. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said he was concerned about the Two Forks Dam project southeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> because, as it was approved earlier this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, it `` could result in very serious adverse environmental impact.'' The action amounted to a veto of a permit issued by the corps, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional administrator in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, who had leaned in favor of allowing the dam to be built. One senior agency source called <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s announcement `` the first step'' in a process that is expected to scuttle the controversial dam. `` This is the door through which you have to travel to get to a veto'' of the entire project, said the official, speaking on the condition that he not be identified further. The Two Forks dam project on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has been the center of a bitter fight between environmentalists and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area officials who say it is needed to meet the region's future water needs. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> ordered the agency's regional office in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> `` to begin a review of potentially unacceptable adverse enviromental effects'' the $ 500 million dam project might pose. `` I am not convinced that the -LRB- Two Forks -RRB- dam project as proposed will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or that the proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for damage to fisheries, wildlife habitat and recreation areas,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said in a statement. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., who has fought the Two Forks project because of concern that it will harm wetlands in western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s decision is expected to kill the proposal `` Those of us who have been fighting this proeject have won,'' said <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> director has done everything that we asked him to do. There's nothing more that he could have done. ... I think this is the practical end to this project.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the proposal as outlined by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> permit issued earlier this month `` does not resolve the critical environmental issues'' that have surrounded the controversial project. Environmentalists have said that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision on the dam will be a barometer of how the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration intends to deal with environmental and conservation issues. City officials in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> argue that the dam is needed to meet the water needs of the metropolitan area in the late 1990s and beyond, but environmentalists have said the 615-foot-high dam and reservoir would be devastating to wildlife habitat up and down the river. Environmentalists have been urging <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> to intervene in the decision on the dam because the agency's regional administrator, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, has indicated he favors the project if certain assurances are included to protect the environment. Opponents of the dam said the provisions included in the tentative construction permit approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month do not satisfy the environmental concerns. `` You can hardly think of anything worse -LRB- environmentally -RRB- than this project,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Luecke </PERSON>, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` It's an enormous project. It's the most destructive way of supplying water to the city of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.'' Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the dam and reservoir would flood a vast area where the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> and its North Fork meet about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. It would flood about 20 miles of the scenic <LOCATION> Cheesman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, which has some of the best trout fishing in the state and is home for a variety of wildlife. The project also has been attacked by <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> officials who fear that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend region of western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and the wetlands that have been a favorite resting spot for whooping crane and numerous other birds. The project was proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and a consortium of 41 <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area water providers and municipalities. Proponents have said the dam is crucial to the region's growth. They argue that the population of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area will grow from 1.5 million people to 2.5 million people by the year 2035 and that such growth will outstrip the area's water supply if the dam is not built.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was ready to license the operation of the $ 5.4 billion <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, although the state already has agreed to dismantle it. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, regional administrator for the commission, said a two-week plant inspection had turned up six items that needed to be corrected before the license could be issued. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said at a news conference that 17 <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials who inspected <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> gave the plant high marks in most areas, and said it could be ready to operate as early as next month.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced strong support for further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space exploration on Friday as he praised the Discovery astronauts for `` exploring the new horizons of this nation's technological future. `` Gentlemen, your mission is accomplished. Your nation says, well done, thank you,'' he told the five astronauts in a White House ceremony. `` You showed exactly where we are going and why,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Pictures taken by the astronauts with the sophisticated IMAX camera will add to the `` knowledge base'' of the global environment, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` That, in turn, will lead to reducing the threat to our Earth's environment,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> greeted the five astronauts, who were clad in blue flight suits, in a ceremony in the Old Executive Office Building. `` This voyage of the shuttle Discovery is over, but its spirit lives, linking the majesty of outer space with the greatness of <LOCATION> Ameria </LOCATION>.'' `` And we're going to forge even stronger links as we reaffirm our commitment to the shuttle program, as our science missions open up new horizons of knowledge and as Space Station Freedom symbolizes the promise of man,'' the president said. In turn, mission commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag carried aboard the shuttle on `` the first flight of this administration,'' and said a gold shuttle charm also carried into space had been given to first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We deeply appreciate your words of support for our country's space program,'' Coats said `` We represent thousands of people that work very hard to get the shuttle of the ground each time, and the encouragement you've shown is deeply appreciated.'' Coats and four crewmates returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> last Saturday after spending five days in orbit aboard space shuttle Discovery. The mission, the third since flights resumed following the Challenger disaster, was the first of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration. The president talked to the astronauts while they were in space and invited them to the White House. While in orbit, Coats and his crew used a powerful 70mm camera called IMAX to photograph areas of the Earth damaged by manmade pollution or by violent natural events such as volcanoes. Film from the camera is to be edited into a movie to be shown by the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s Air and Space Museum. The Discovery astronauts also launched a communications satellite and conducted a series of experiments during the mission. The Bushes left the White House in early afternoon to spend the weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md. Travelling by motorcade because rain forced the cancellation of a planned helicopter trip, the president stopped on the way to visit former Salvadoran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for tests and treatment. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is dying of liver cancer. The first family was to be joined by three <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chlidren and six grandchildren over the weekend, as well as the family dog, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, and her six week-old pups. Country singer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, who frequently appeared at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign events last year, and his family were to join the Bushes on Saturday. The first family was to attend private Easter services at Camp David, have their traditional Easter turkey dinner, then return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the chistening of <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was born Feb. 7. The child of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the president's 11th grandchild.

 Striking public employees Friday lifted blockades of ports and airports that have isolated this French Mediterranean island for more than a week, and they accepted a government proposal for talks. Airlines operated normally from the two main airports at <LOCATION> Ajaccio </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bastia </ORGANIZATION>, carrying away tourists trapped in <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> since the air and sea shutdown started 10 days ago. Two boats unloaded 1,700 tons of meat and chicken, allowing stores to start replenishing dwindling supplies. The strike by <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>'s public sector began six weeks ago, with workers demanding a special bonus because of the unusually high prices in <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>. The cost of living in <LOCATION> Ajaccio </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bastia </ORGANIZATION>, the two main Corsican cities, is estimated at 4.2 percent above the French national average. Unions Friday agreed to send representatives to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> this weekend for talks with the ministries of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, union officials said. Tension had been mounting the past week with sporadic clashes between demonstrators and police.

<HEAD>Dick Tracy Originals Missing From Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RYE BROOK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No crook gets the better of <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, but someone has stolen valuable original panels of the famous syndicated cartoon strip from the Museum of Cartoon Art. A number of Tracy panels were willed to the museum by the creator of the jut-jawed champion of law and order, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, who died in 1985. Museum director <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said Friday that because of press reports and rumors within the cartoon art community, she was confirming that <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> strips are missing, but she declined to say how many or what they depicted. Nor would she say how many panels <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> had left the museum or how they had been displayed. `` To say more would jeopardize the investigation and the museum's position in recovering any art work,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said The <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office confirmed the museum filed a complaint Tuesday but declined to give details. `` Those things go for a minimum of $ 1,200 to $ 1,500 apiece,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Locher </PERSON>, who has been drawing the strip for <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for the past five years. His collaborator, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Muscatine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, who has been writing the strip's story line since 1977, said that what <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> left the museum `` were highly prized strips that obviously had been set aside by the creator.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was quoted in the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Time as saying he believed some of the missing panels depicted important developments in the history of the strip. Hallmarks of the strip, which originated in 1931, have been <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s two-way wrist radio and its bizarrely named and drawn characters, like the villains Pruneface, Flattop and Mumbles; <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s girl friend, <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Trueheart </PERSON>; and such friendlies as B.O. Plenty and <PERSON> Gravel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gertie </PERSON>.

 Workers at a cement company discovered explosives inside an Easter cake sent to their boss in an apparent extortion attempt, police said Friday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Not only was 1988 the city's most murderous year, it was also a record-breaking 12 months for aggravated assult, larceny and car theft, according to figures released Friday. The reason for the crime wave can be summed up in a word: crack. `` It's sweeping the country,'' Assistant Chief <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said of the highly addictive cocaine derivative. `` It's been here since 1986, that's when the figures started going up dramatically.'' Murders and non-negligent manslaughters increased 13.4 percent in a year, from 1,672 to 1,896. The old record was 1,826 people, set in 1981. In 1988, 36.8 percent of all the murders committed in the city were drug-related, which means nearly two people a day lost their lives because of drugs, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` And those are only the ones we are definitely sure of. I'm sure there's more.'' Drugs also play a significant role in auto thefts, which skyrocketed 25.4 percent from 1987 to 1988. `` They're stealing cars, reducing them to parts, selling them and using a portion of the money to buy crack,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. The only decline in crime came in the number of reported rapes, which dropped 2.7 percent from 3,507 in 1987 to 3,412 in 1988, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The body of cave explorer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was laid to rest for the fifth time Friday, 64 years after his entrapment and death in a cave. `` Hopefully this will be for the last time,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' nephew, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of Horse Cave <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was pronounced dead Feb. 16, 1925, 18 days after he entered Sand Cave in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. After his death, his body was recovered from the cave and buried, later exhumed for public display, stolen and dumped along the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and then put back on display. The cave where <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> died is now part of Mammoth Cave National Park, about 30 miles north of Bowling Green. Relatives and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> worked out arrangements to re-inter the body. `` The story of <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> reminds us all we are fragile beings,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Talley </PERSON> told an estimated 50 friends and relatives gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Mammoth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> cemetery in the park. Both the poor and the privileged shared `` their concern and compassion for the plight of one of their own kind,'' said <PERSON> Talley </PERSON>, minister at <ORGANIZATION> Cave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which several of <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' relatives attend <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was 37 when he entered Sand Cave on Jan. 30, 1925. He was trying to find a new entrance to Crystal Cave, the cavern he discovered under his father's farm in <LOCATION> Edmonson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1917. Caves in the area were privately operated then, and competition for tourists' dollars ran high. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was on his way out of the cave when he was trapped in a small passageway by rocks that fell onto his foot and ankle. More than 30 news organizations sent reporters to cover the story of relatives, friends and strangers working to free <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. The rescue efforts were `` hampered by the carnival atmosphere swirling around the cave entrance,'' Mammoth Cave National Park Superintendent <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihalic </PERSON> said Friday. He said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> probably remained alive most of the time he was trapped, but died of exposure before he could be rescued. His body was removed from the cave and buried near an entrance to Crystal Cave. Later, when the property was sold, his body was disinterred, placed in a different casket and displayed in a large cavern in Crystal Cave. Four years later, it was stolen and later found at the edge of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. People speculated that competitors _ jealous of the attention his body created at <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cave </ORGANIZATION> _ had stolen it, but no one was ever arrested, said park historian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. Eventually the body was returned to <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cave </LOCATION>, where it remained in a black casket chained to a concrete base. At one point, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' casket was included on tours of the cave. Until around 1948, visitors were allowed to view the body through a window in the casket lid. The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> bought the cave in 1961 and closed it. `` For family members, today is a kind of a final end to what they had considered a sore spot in their lives,'' <PERSON> Mihalic </PERSON> said. `` It's a final chapter; a closing of some sort.''

<HEAD>FTC Says Tentative Agreement Reached on Conditions for Purchase of
Bottlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had reached tentative agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on conditions for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 1.75 billion purchase of 17 soft-drink bottlers from General Cinema. The agreement, a draft consent order, calls for General Cinema to retain distribution of competing brands in the Staunton, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, areas. Both companies will maintain existing assets and operations in those two locations while the commission considers the order and decides whether to challenge the acquisition in court. Under the draft order, the competing brands will be bottled by <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> for General Cinema at cost for five years in the two cities. General Cinema will not be required to rely on <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> to supply products for distribution, according to an announcement from the commission. Without such provisions, `` <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> would have been both a bottler of those -LRB- competing -RRB- brands, as well as a supplier of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> brand products distributed by Pepsi-owned bottlers,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said. A companion complaint, which the draft consent order would settle, said `` the acquisition would eliminate direct competition in branded soft drinks as well as all soft drinks between the acquired bottler and other bottlers in the Staunton and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- markets, and would increase the likelihood of collusion in the markets, which are already highly concentrated and difficult to enter.'' In Staunton, the other brands are those of the Dr Pepper and <ORGANIZATION> Barq </ORGANIZATION>'s companies and in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> they are those of <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barq </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Sunkist </ORGANIZATION>. The other 15 bottlers being acquired `` are essentially bottlers of Pepsi products,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> of the commission's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION>. The draft consent order would require commission approval of any transfer of the Staunton and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> distribution operations by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> during the next 10 years. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> would have to obtain commission approval for any acquisition in those two markets for five years, and would have to notify the commission for 10 years of any bottler acquisition anywhere that would result in <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> becoming a distributor of `` more than an insubstantial amount'' of other brands wherever <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> supplies concentrate for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> brands. The order remains open for public comment for 60 days. It is not an admission of any allegations in the companion complaint, but if adopted by the commission its terms carry the force of law and violations may result in civil fines of $ 10,000. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is one of the nation's largest soft-drink and snack-food concerns with sales of about $ 11.5 billion in 1987. General Cinema, based in <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, had revenue of about $ 720 million from bottling operations in the fiscal year that ended last Oct. 31, and also owns 1,359 movie screens in 318 theaters, a 60 percent interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Neiman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcus </ORGANIZATION> group of retail stores and 18 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British candy and soft-drink firm.

<HEAD>Contra Pact is Tacit Admission of Failure of Reagan's Approach</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s compromise policy toward <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was a tacit admission that his predecessor's military approach has failed and a signal that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in turn, is willing to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> latitude in the region it was reluctant to provide <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> But because the new bipartisan approach leans heavily on how <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government behaves over the coming months, it represents a respite, rather than a final settlement of the long-running policy dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. For now, both sides on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> are willing to read the somewhat vague and artfully drawn two-page policy agreement in their own ways. Democrats stress language supporting regional peace efforts and provisions permitting aid to the Contra rebels to be used to relocate them into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and re-integrate them into the political process there. Republicans emphasize that such resettlement is strictly voluntary, and that the agreement does not bar future military aid to the rebels should Sandinista promises be unfulfilled. The agreement means the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` still supports the Contras as a viable force,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., whose most conservative colleagues were restless about the policy accord signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he hoped the peace process would work and that the Nicaraguan government would open its political system to opponents. `` But if not, if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> continue to do what they have been doing _ saying one thing and doing another _ you're going to see at least an effort for military aid in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' But Democrats pointed out that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new secretary of state, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, had specifically de-emphasized that kind of thinking during hours of talks with key lawmakers over the past month. At the very outset of those conversations, they noted, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said military aid _ the issue that bedeviled President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ would play no role in the discussions Announcing the new policy at the White House on Friday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` We all have to admit that the policy basically failed to some extent, because we were not united.'' That conclusion is underscored by an unreleased draft report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which concludes that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s single-minded reliance on military solutions, both in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other countries in the region, `` slowed progress toward economic reforms and development,'' which it says are the region's real problems `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies toward the region since 1980 appear to have been driven largely by a need to counter the threat of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> expansionism,'' says the report, being prepared for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee Democrats. The new accord between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> puts that goal on a diplomatic track. It notes that continued communist support for `` violence and subversion'' in the region violate the five nations' peace agreements. But it calls on the Soviets and Cubans to themselves come into compliance with the peace process by ending their military backing for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the rebels fighting <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s government. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' next step will be to pass, soon after it returns from its Easter break next month, legislation providing the $ 45 million or so needed to continue `` humanitarian'' aid to the Contras through February 1990, after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s scheduled national elections. Because of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s efforts to reach bipartisan accord on the underlying policy, that step is expected to be far easier than past aid renewals. More significant in the long run than the agreement to give the new administration an extension of <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' willingness to restore to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the latitude to conduct policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that it had revoked from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recognizes the need for consistency and continuity in policy and the responsibility of the executive to administer and carry out that policy, the programs based upon it, and to conduct <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomacy in the region,'' the document stated. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s covert war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, which led to the Iran-Contra affair, also prompted a plethora of restrictions on money spent in the region. For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, lawmakers are willing simply to say that they support the use of rewards and punishments to encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> along the road to democratization, and for now will let the administration decide which actions to take and when to take them.

<TEXT>
 An oil tanker ran aground today about 25 miles outside this port, spilling an estimated 200,000 barrels of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Cmdr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, commander of the port at the southern end of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline, said the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was heading outbound from the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> marine terminal with 1.26 million barrels of oil aboard when it ran hard aground at <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. Petty Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> estimated that by midmorning, an oil slick streched southward five miles into the sound from the site of the tanker, toward an open body of water. `` At present, we do n't see it approaching any land,'' he said. There were no reports of injuries, officials said. The crew remained aboard the tanker. `` The ship is hard aground. It's not moving at this time,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. `` There definitely are holes in the hull,'' he said. Three tanks on the right side of the tanker have holes, he said, and `` we think the centerline tanks also have holes.'' <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> said estimates put the leak at 200,000 barrels, or 8.4 million gallons, and said the tanker continued to leak at about 20,000 gallons an hour. Employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline for a consortium of oil companies, were on their way to try to contain the oil with booms, he said. Two Coast Guard investigators went aboard the tanker to begin looking into the cause. Officials think the vessel may have gone aground as the captain tried to maneuver around icebergs from the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> glacier, <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> said. There is a hole or gash in the vessel below the water line, he said, and divers planned to go down and assess the damage in more detail. He said the new estimate of leakage came from looking at videotapes taken of the scene by pilots flying over. Earlier, the size of the spill was put at 150,000 barrels. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate detail on of damage to the shoreline or marine environment. The 987-foot tanker, which has a capacity of 1.3 million barrel in about 15 large tanks, left <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> at 10 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> AST </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and ran ground about 12:30 a.m. today -LRB- 4:30 a.m. EST -RRB-, officials said. The tanker is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, the nation's northernmost ice-free port, is a town of 3,100 about 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. It looks out onto the island-dotted <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION>, which is near a number of recreation areas. Fishing, as well as tourism, is an important industry, but the main seasons for various types of fishing are still weeks away. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was responding to two concerns _ pollution and the safety of the ship, <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. `` It appears that the rate of release of the oil has been greatly reduced. It probably lost the largest portion of that oil when it ran aground. But it's still leaking. `` A concern we have, too, is the structural integrity of the ship,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. `` We're concerned about what further damage would be done if attempts were made to remove it -LRB- the vessel -RRB- early. `` We've got the pollution to go after and the off-loading.'' Another tanker, the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, is not far from the stricken tanker and officials hoped oil could be transferred from the Valdez to the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. The worst oil spill in terms of financial loss claims was the 66 million-gallon spill from the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadiz </ORGANIZATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in March 1978, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Losses were put at $ 1.7 billion.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s choice to head the civil rights division resigned from that division in the early 1960s shortly after he flunked the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> bar exam, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said Friday. However, spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said she could not confirm that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> had been forced to resign because of the failed bar exam, as <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said she did not have records from the personnel office pertaining to whether <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was forced to leave the division and had been unable to reach <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to ask him about it. He passed the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> bar exam in 1971, she said, adding that he would not have to pass the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> bar if he became assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights division. Civil rights groups have expressed concern that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a black Democrat-turned-Republican who ran unsuccessfully for governor of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1986, might be the wrong person to head the civil rights division. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was offered a job in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division in April 1962, and the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police officer took the position after he completed law school at <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He was hired as an attorney contingent on his passing the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> bar exam within nine months, <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said. In August 1963, he became a legal assistant in the department's civil rights division and, in November 1963, was given a one-month extension to await the results of the bar exam, she said, adding that such extensions are standard procedure He did not pass the exam and, in December 1963, became an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, she said. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> remained with the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> for six weeks, leaving in January 1964 to join the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said. He was assigned first to the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> field office and, in 1965 to the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> office, where he remained until June 1968, when he resigned. Although <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> announced a month ago that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was his choice to head the division, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> still has not nominated him formally. <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said part of the reason for the delay was that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> `` was just interviewed last week by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' People who had been interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> several weeks earlier also have not yet been formally nominated by the White House, she said. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who is in private legal practice in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, has said on resumes that he served as an `` assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney'' or as `` an investigator and attorney in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' despite the fact that he did not actually serve as an attorney since he had not passed the bar. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said recently that he `` was classified as an attorney,'' and believed that he `` was an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' But he also has said that discrepancies on his resumes were due to `` carelessness.''

 Indian peacekeeping forces have killed more than 300 Tamil civilians in a northern district, the most powerful and biggest Tamil rebel group said Friday. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> dismissed the charge as propaganda. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the leader of the Tamils' semiautonomous government warned there will be a blood bath unless authorities in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> give his officials more power. An Indian High Commission official in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> said the rebel charges were their `` usual propaganda.'' He said 76 militants and 26 soldiers have been killed in operations this month in northern <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION> district. Sri Lankan officials said the dead include nine soldiers and six militants who were killed in hand-to-hand fighting Thursday and two soldiers killed when rebels blew up their jeep. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> today accused the Indian army of committing the crime of genocide against the Tamil people in its desperate drive to crush the armed resistance of the Tamil Tiger guerrillas in the northeastern region of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>,'' a rebel statement said. It said Indian troops have killed more than 300 civilians in <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION> since March 2, when the soldiers started searching the area for rebels. It was not possible to investigate the rebel charges independently. <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION> is 175 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are believed to be based in the district's marshy jungles. At least 40,000 Indian soldiers are in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to put down the Tamil insurrection. The troops initially were deployed to supervise a rebel arms surrender agreed in an Indian-sponsored peace accord July 1987. The rebels reneged two months later. Nevertheless, the government set up a Northeastern Provincial government to give Tamils limited autonomy. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the new government's chief minister <PERSON> Vardarajan </PERSON> <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> appealed to the Indian government to intercede to save the accord, which he said is jeopardized by the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> government's `` intransigent and adamant attitude. <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> said his government has no control over education, administrative services, law and order and allotment and distribution of land. `` If there is no reasonable solution, everything will collapse,'' <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> told a news conference. `` How far -LRB- the Sri Lankan government -RRB- will devolve power will determine the unity and integrity of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We will ask, then we will request and then we will appeal. If there is no response, we will take.'' <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> said Indian leaders had made no commitments. `` The Indian government says it will do the maximum but they are requesting us to be patient,'' he said. `` We feel that if the provincial council fails there will be no solution except a blood bath.'' Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and say the majority Sinhalese discriminate against them in and jobs and education. At least 8,500 people, including 800 Indian soldiers, have been killed since 1983, when Tamil militants started a campaign for a separate state. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> got involved because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils.

 The government has charged two men with stealing a 14th-century Chinese vase and other works of art from six museums in daylight heists, federal officials said Friday. The art works and antiques, ranging from the $ 2 million vase to 16 antique pocket watches, have a total value of $ 3.5 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The works were taken from Jan. 12 to Feb. 25 from museums in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Athanasatos </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Corteselli </PERSON>, 28, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, pleaded innocent to theft charges and were ordered held without bail. A total of 25 objects were stolen, officials said. The two men `` have been linked with some but not all of these items,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> told a news conference where most of the recovered objects were displayed. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said most of the objects were taken during normal working hours when the museums were open to the public. They were removed from plexiglass-covered display cases which did not have burglar alarms, he said. The five-count federal indictment charged the pair with transporting across state lines and selling antique watches worth $ 150,000, stolen from the Baltimore Museum of Art. <PERSON> Athanasatos </PERSON> also was charged with interstate transportation of a $ 50,000 silver <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> pitcher stolen from the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of Art on Jan. 12. The pitcher was recovered by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on March 6 after it was sold to an antiques dealer for $ 15,000. Both men were ordered detained without bail because of other outstanding warrants, said defense lawyer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>. They were indicted last week by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on stolen goods trafficking involving the 14th century, Yuan Dynasty vase, worth $ 2 million, that was stolen from the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>.

 More than 5,000 opposition activists marched through <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Friday to protest the rule of President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, who seized power in a bloodless coup seven years ago. `` Gen. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> has killed democracy and his government is ruining the country's economy,'' said <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the major opposition alliance, in an address to the rally.

 <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> worked as a librarian at <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for 30 years, yet she never got around to cashing paychecks totaling more than $ 100,000. The 72-year-old woman got the money anyway Friday when State Treasurer <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> presented an $ 88,100.85 check to Miss <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>'s cousin and guardian, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleghorn </PERSON>, after a special act of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> made that possible. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s office said it already had re-issued checks amounting to $ 20,024.53 for uncashed checks not more than 5 years old, bringing the total reimbursement to $ 108.125.33. Miss <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> occasionally cashed a paycheck, Mrs. <PERSON> Gleghorn </PERSON> said, but co-workers tried for years to get her to cash the rest of the checks. `` I really do n't know why she did n't cash the checks. That's what everybody asks,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gleghorn </PERSON> said. `` I know she was reminded several times they should be cashed ... but she just did n't go ahead and do it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gleghorn </PERSON> said many of the uncashed checks probably were destroyed when the rundown house Miss <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> lived in for many years was demolished for safety reasons. Miss <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> retired in 1986 and now lives in a <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> retirement center. Mrs. <PERSON> Gleghorn </PERSON>, appointed Miss <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>'s guardian in August, said her cousin has suffered from memory problems for several years. Mrs. <PERSON> Gleghorn </PERSON> asked state Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodall </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> for help in getting the money. Working with state officials, Mrs. <PERSON> Gleghorn </PERSON> verified records of Miss <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>'s paychecks between 1963 and 1983, except for a two-year period. Since the state treasurer is not obligated to honor an uncashed check more than five years old, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had to enact a special appropriations measure so Miss <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> could be paid, and Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> signed it into law. `` I'm relieved it's over,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gleghorn </PERSON> said. `` Should she need extra care in the future, it's good to know there's some money there.''

<TEXT>
 A glass-covered tour boat carrying 500 people on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> collided with a barge near Notre Dame Cathedral, killing one person, officials said Friday. Police said the captains of the vessels blamed each other for the crash Thursday night between the Notre Dame and Arcole bridges in one of the most picturesque spots of central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Firefighters treated 10 people for shock and took 10 others suffering from sprains and bruises to hospitals, according to police. Eleven Americans, two Spaniards and four Portuguese were among those treated, police said. All those who were taken to hospitals were released. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessa </PERSON>, 28, a Portuguese student on the tour boat, was killed when he was struck in the head by an open window that swung shut in the impact of the collision, police said. Frogmen searched the river to make sure no one had been knocked overboard. The accident occurred when the tour boat, known as the <PERSON> Bateau </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouche </PERSON>, was hit head on by the 2,500-ton barge, part of a convoy of five vessels. Sources close to the investigation quoted the tour boat captain as saying the barge was poorly lighted. The barge captain said the Bateau Mouche failed to respect the rules of navigation on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION>, ignoring a signal. The tourist boat is one of nine that ply the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> daily, lighting up historic buildings of old <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with huge spotlights. The owner of Bateau Mouche boats said 1.75 million people went on Seine cruises in 1988. Company officials said they could not recall any comparable accident in the company's 40-year history.

 Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected a truce in his Christian army's fight with Druse militiamen and Syrian soldiers, and declared Friday he will settle for nothing less than Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The 17-day-old artillery and rocket battle, in which Syrian troops joined the Druse this week, resumed in the afternoon after a 14-hour lull. Hundreds of rounds fell on both sides of the line that divides <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> between Christians and Moslems, and on Druse and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> towns in the mountains overlooking the capital, police said. Rocket volleys and popping flares lighted the night sky and rumbling explosions shook the city. Police had no immediate report on casualties, but have given the total in previous action as 81 people killed and 253 wounded, most of them civilians. It is the worst fighting since 1985 in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war and magnifies a political crisis that arose last fall, creating sectarian army commands and competing Christian and Moslem governments. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he would continue the battle even if <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is demolished. `` This city has been wiped out by seven or eight earthquakes in ancient history,'' he said. `` We will build a ninth <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> if it is destroyed in this confrontation.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was withdrawing a military `` technical assistance team at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as part of the embassy's policy of reducing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel due to the current situation.'' He said one member of the three-man team already was abroad on vacation. The Americans came to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1983 to train army personnel in the use of U.S.-made equipment. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying `` everyone with influence ought to act in a responsible manner and exercise restraint.'' It did not name <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, but officials said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> had spoken with Syrian authorities about the need for a cease-fire. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told a news conference the Americans were being pulled out shortly before the end of their term and `` their withdrawal will not have any effect on the army.'' He leads the interim Christian government in addition to commanding the 20,000 Christians in the Lebanese army, who are much better equipped than the 22,000 Moslems led by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>'s men have helped blockade the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> but appear to have stayed out of the fighting, which began two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports operated by Moslem militias. The Christian commander held a news conference at the presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> after meeting with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON>, who told reporters they discussed `` a cease-fire and a solution to the present confrontation. <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> again after a session in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, the Sunni Moslem premier of the Syrian-backed Moslem government, then returned to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> without comment. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said his confrontation with the Syrians and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia was `` a nationalist march to liberate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' `` It is the responsibility of the whole people,'' he said. `` The life of the Lebanese should no more be in the hands of a Syrian soldier who can pull the trigger any minute.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is `` a terrorist country,'' he said, and `` we ca n't figure out how a terrorist country can have a peacekeeping role.'' Neighboring <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> president, has become this country's main power broker in the chaos of civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he is pursuing a `` nationalist cause, not a Christian cause'' in fighting the Syrians and their allies. `` The Syrians are slaughtering us,'' he said of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` They are trying to eliminate our country ... reduce it to ashes.'' Asked whether the current violence would would block efforts by an Arab League mediation committee to settle the crisis, he replied: `` It should n't.'' <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Thursday by the six-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee, which Arab foreign ministers formed at an emergency meeting in January. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, is the chairman. The crisis was born when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term ended Sept. 22 and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> could not agree on a successor. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to lead an interim government but Moslems, with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s support, swore allegiance to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who had been premier under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. The army commands split as a result of the sectarian division in government. An unwritten covenant dating to independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943 requires the president to be a Christian, the premier a Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday he invested $ 5,000 to help promote Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s book in 1984 because he thought the newly elected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> whip had a message that `` ought to get out.'' But <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, real estate developer who serves as treasurer of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and honorary chief of staff to Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, said he has never supported <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> politically and has never contributed to his congressional campaigns. In fact, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, he contributed $ 500 last year to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s Democratic opponent, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>'s investment in a partnership set up to promote <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s book, `` Window of Opportunity,'' was disclosed Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in a article that also said <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>'s company had received a $ 204,480 grant in 1988 from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> denied having received such a grant. And <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, after searching department records Friday, said they could find no evidence of a grant award last year to <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>'s company, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> in the economics and analysis branch of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> regional office said <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> was given preliminary approval by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 for a 60-unit low income housing project for the elderly in <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The letter of approval said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> would pay rent subsidies to the tenants once the project was completed and the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would guarantee the financing for the units.

 A survey released Friday indicated majority support for <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s refusal to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would try to persuade the prime minister `` something good might come'' from talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are to confer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 6. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said two Palestinians died of wounds suffered earlier, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers wounded 25 Palestinians during protests in nine towns and refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. One of the wounded was said to be a 4-month-old girl hit in the head by a rubber bullet. The two deaths raised to 407 the number of Palestinians killed since an uprising began in the occupied territories more than 15 months ago. Eighteen Israelis have been slain. Seven moderate Palestinian leaders in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, have been threatened with death if they continue meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials about peace, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources reported Friday's survey by the independent <PERSON> Modain </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezrahi </PERSON> organization said 56 percent of 1,251 Israeli Jews chosen at random said `` no'' when asked: `` Do you believe there is room for negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and if so, toward what end?'' The survey's margin of error was given as plus or minus 2 percent. A survey conducted in December indicated 54 percent of Israelis favored talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, on condition it ceased attacking Israeli targets. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism in December and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> initiated contacts after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s public declaration and the second formal meeting was held Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Israeli </PERSON> of <PERSON> Modain </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezrachi </PERSON> attributed the change in response between December and March to the fact that organization asked only about talks without mentioning an end to terrorism or any other condition. `` Many people do not believe the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has stopped their terror activities,'' she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was quoted in an interview published Friday in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying of his forthcoming meeting with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>: `` I will tell him that the talks that we ... are having with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives there in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> are good things'' and would try to persuade the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader `` something good might come out of this kind of discussion.'' Asked whether he would urge <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to join the talks, the paper said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't know what I'll say to him about that, but I'll say to him that we have got to move the peace process forward. We may, by then, be ready with some specific ideas.'' Israeli news reports have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to propose a first stage of negotiations with Palestinians in the occupied territories, with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> joining talks later on the final status of the territories. Arab sources, speaking privately, said the death threats involved two masked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths from a dissident <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction who visited the Palestinian moderates March 17. They identified the faction as the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, led by Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> and based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the men were threatened at knifepoint. It said supporters of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> were among them, including Dr. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazaleh </PERSON>, a former member of the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> city council. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazaleh </PERSON> was reached by telephone and denied receiving threats. A leaflet circulated in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to freeze contacts with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials to prevent <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> from pursuing plans to circumvent the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in peace talks, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. In an interview with the daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as saying he would pursue secret talks with non-PLO Palestinians. `` There are among them wise people, intellectuals,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` I am not going to reveal their names because it may bring them harm.'' Hadashot, another daily, said he might have the <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> secret police investigate a leak last week of a secret military report that concluded there were no non-PLO Palestinians with whom <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could negotiate peace. A <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide denied the report. <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Taman </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, died Friday of chest wounds suffered in a confrontation with soldiers two days earlier, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, 23, died at a hospital in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> the day after an explosive device went off in his hands.

<HEAD>Magazine Report: Islamic Group Has 2 Stinger Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A militant Moslem group has acquired two U.S.-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles originally intended for Afghan guerrillas, <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Shiraa </ORGANIZATION> magazine reported Friday. The weekly quoted an unidentified source close to the group as saying the shoulder-held missiles `` have reached <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> through an embassy that provided part of the large sum paid.'' The magazine did not identify the group or the embassy. It also did not specify whether the fundamentalists were Shiite or Sunni Moslem. Sunni factions have been inactive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for some time, however, and the magazine implied the militants belonged to a pro-Iranian Shiite group. The missiles were shipped by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to seven Afghan guerrilla factions based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the magazine said. The phrasing of the report indicated the Moslem Afghan guerrillas sold the Stingers to the Lebanese group. The Stinger is the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>' most potent anti-aircraft weapon. The Afghan insurgents used the missiles to shoot down Soviet fighter-bombers, helicopters and transport planes in the nine-year war against <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said the Lebanese group was trying to smuggle the Stingers out of the country, but did not elaborate. The report followed warnings of possible attacks on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> jetliners as part of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s confrontation with Western nations over <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, `` The Satanic Verses.'' Many Moslems say the novel defames Islam. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, quoted an unidentified spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and airports around the world have been put on alert for possible terrorist action. Ash-Shiraa gained international fame in November 1986 when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in return for American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions. But the magazine's recent reports on the 15 foreign captives held mainly by pro-Iranian factions have been inaccurate.

 Hundreds of civilians fled from two village after rebels of the Holy Spirit Movement attacked and looted their homes, the government-owned New Vision newspaper reported Friday. It reported women, children and elderly people thronged the road to nearby Lira after the attack Thursday on Alawo and Anyeke in the northern district of <ORGANIZATION> Apac </ORGANIZATION>, 280 north of <LOCATION> Kampala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s capital. New Vision quoted one witness, who was not identified, as saying, `` The rebels surrounded the villages and shouted, ` Do n't run! Moments later they started unleashing terror on the villagers.'' The newspaper said witnesses did not know how many people were killed and wounded. The rebels, led by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Konyi </PERSON>, have been terrorizing northern villages since early last year. They first used the name <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON> 2 after the Holy Spirit Movement led by warrior-priestess <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON> was crushed by army troops in late 1987. Ms. <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and her follower returned to their home region in northern <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and regrouped. <PERSON> Konyi </PERSON> subsequently became leader and adopted the Holy Spirit Movement name. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sources estimate that he has from 1,200 to 2,500 followers.

<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Friday he is directing his department's scientists to devote more attention to new methods of nuclear waste cleanup to support a plan to establish cleanup priorities and schedules over the next five years. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> wrote members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he hopes to have the cleanup plan in place by August. During the next five years, `` immediate problems'' will be `` corrected'' and detailed long-term cleanup plans will be drawn up for each site, said spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Keif </PERSON>. The department produces nuclear weapons in at least 16 laboraties and factories in 12 states. Waste, both nuclear and chemical, generated since the formation of the World War II <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project in 1942 has resulted in massive contamination of some areas around the facilities. The laboratories include some of the national laboratories run by the department, where some of the nation's best scientists have conducted basic research in a wide range of scientific disciplines. It is these scientists that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> will call on for more environmental work, possibly designating facilities to be in charge of particular techniques or fields. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee earlier this month that he doubts the accuracy of common cleanup cost estimates of $ 60 billion to $ 100 billion. `` I do n't believe we need all those gold watches,'' or frills, he said then. In his letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the five-year plan will be composed of site plans that will ensure compliance with all applicable state and federal requirements; `` will characterize and assess the extent of contamination, where it exists, and assess potential risk. The highest priorities will be placed on facilities where contamination has occured that may potentially affect public heatlh and the environment.'' In addition, the department will `` assess current technology development activities and provide a basis for future research, development and demonstration of new and innovative environmental technologies.'' He said he intended to `` establish with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the states agreed-upon milestones to address the development of new technologies as well as our environmental cleanup responsibilities.''

 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> today received a maximum sentence of 8 to 25 years in prison for killing 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, his illegally adopted daughter. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> showed `` extreme callousness'' and no remorse after the slaying, also recommended against parole. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> would normally be eligible for parole in less than seven years because he has already been jailed for nearly 17 months since his arrest. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter Jan. 30 for the November 1987 beating death. Hundreds of letter writers had urged that he get the maximum punishment. The death resulted from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s `` life of violence, selfishness and self-gratification at the expense of other people,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCusker </PERSON> told the court. `` Mr. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has shown not one ounce of remorse for killing <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>.'' An emotional <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who did not testify at his trial, addressed the court before his sentencing, saying, `` I understand the meaning of remorse. I have remorse about losing my life.'' He insisted he had not abused his daughter. `` At no point did I ever ... neglect her, did I ever strike her in any way,'' he said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> _ who smiled, chuckled and fidgeted while his lawyers offered lengthy presentencing motions _ wanted the judge to `` feel he is worthy of redemption,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said earlier. But Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON>, in a presentence report released this morning, called <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> an `` insensitive, remorseless killer'' who should receive the maximum sentence without chance of parole. `` In the year and half since -LRB- <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s -RRB- death, he has yet to express any remorse for killing her,'' <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> wrote in an 18-page presentencing memorandum. `` Society needs to be protected from such a self-centered, insensitive, remorseless killer,'' the memo continued. `` The only appropriate sentence is the maximum sentence ... with a recommendation against any parole.'' Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> had gotten hundreds of letters from adoptive parents, childless couples and people abused as children urging him to throw the book at <LOCATION> Steinberg </LOCATION>. The sources said letters from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> also came from child advocacy groups and domestic violence projects, including a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> organization responsible for writing more than 100 letters. Not one of the letters recommended mercy for <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the sources said, and some demanded the death penalty, which <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lacks. <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON>, asked to make the letters public, said he had destroyed any letters involving the case. But a family advocacy group, <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, showed reporters its letter to the judge, which said the maximum sentence `` will communicate that unspeakable crimes against children shall not be condoned.'' A disbarred lawyer, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had received the child shortly after birth from an unwed teen-ager and raised her as his own rather than arranging for the baby's adoption as he had promised. Charges against <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s long-time live-in companion, were dropped when prosecutors determined she was too physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for the girl's death. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, testified under immunity as the star prosecution witness in <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s trial, during which defense attorneys contended she was responsible for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s fatal beating. The <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> case focused national attention on domestic violence and the question of who should report cases of suspected child abuse.

 Jurors who sentenced <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to die 12 years ago say they are convinced they erred in declaring him guilty, but blame a prosecutor for swaying their minds by suppressing evidence. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 40, was greeted by yellow ribbons and rousing cheers when he returned Thursday to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, after the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney dropped the case against him. He was freed on bond Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ordered a new trial. His case garnered wide attention after `` The Thin Blue Line,'' a documentary film, raised doubts about his guilt. `` If he had gone to the death chamber and all this had come out later, that would have been a horrible thing to have on my conscience,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>, jury forewoman at <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' 1977 trial. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> came within three days of execution in 1980 for the shooting death of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> before his sentence was commuted to life in prison. `` Based on everything that I have seen and read and on this man's reactions, I just do n't believe the man is guilty,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>, 66, told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said Thursday he would not seek a new trial and filed a motion to dismiss the capital murder charge against <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The appeals court, in ordering a new trial for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, ruled prosecutor <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> had allowed a key witness to commit perjury and had suppressed evidence that the witness' original description of the killer did not match <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` It makes you wonder sometimes about the judicial system,'' said juror <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Rammey </PERSON>. `` If somebody as powerful as the DA's office can manipulate witnesses, it seems to me there's something wrong `` Hopefully, we'll all learn something from it,'' <PERSON> Rammey </PERSON>, 47, said. <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> has denied any misconduct and said he believes <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is guilty. He did not immediately return a telephone call Friday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` If anything was kept from us, I blame <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>,'' juror <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>, 74, said. `` What happened is not the jury's fault.''

<HEAD>EPA Raises Concerns About Proposed Project in Colorado</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> raised serious concerns Friday about a controversial proposed dam and reservoir in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, threatening to scuttle the $ 500 million project if no additional safeguards are provided. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the Two Forks Dam project near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> `` could result in very serious adverse environmental impact'' and ordered the regional office to immediately examine `` alternative water sources'' with city officials. Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s decision is expected to kill the proposal `` Those of us who have been fighting this project have won. ... I think this is the practical end to this project,'' said <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> announced he had begun procedures which amount to overruling a construction permit issued earlier this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and which could lead to a veto of the project if compromises are not worked out. `` This is the door through which you have to travel to get to a veto'' of the project, said a senior <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on the condition that he not be identified by name. The Two Forks dam project on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has been the center of a bitter fight between environmentalists and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area officials who say the dam is essential to the region's future water needs. Environmentalists have said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision on the dam will be an early signal of how the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration intends to deal with environmental and conservation issues. `` This action demonstrates the president is serious about establishing himself as an environmental president,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the 615-foot dam and reservoir would flood a vast area where the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> and its North Fork meet about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. It would put under 500 feet of water a 20-mile area including the scenic <LOCATION> Cheesman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, which has some of the best trout fishing in the state and is home for a variety of wildlife. The project also has been attacked by <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> officials who fear that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend wetland region of western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, a favorite resting spot for whooping crane and numerous other birds. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the permit as approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> could have `` very serious adverse environmental impacts ... and may not provide adequate safeguards.'' `` I am not convinced that the -LRB- Two Forks -RRB- dam project as proposed will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or that the proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for damage to fisheries, wildlife habitat and recreation areas,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said in a statement. Environmentalists have been urging <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> to intervene because the agency's regional administrator, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, had indicated he favors the project if certain assurances are included to protect the environment. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said he was `` disappointed that the decision could not be made at the regional level.'' <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said conditions had been put into the permit `` that satisfied a number of concerns I have had.'' But <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> overruled the regional administrator, saying that the project as proposed does not meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act and directed <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> to initiate the veto process for the existing permit. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> as well as project applicants have 15 days to try to work out safeguards that might satisfy <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. If they fail to do so, the process would continue, possibly over several months, leading to a likely veto of the project, officials said.

 High school enrollment has fallen more than 25 percent since 1978, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> embarked on ambitious economic development, and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> says there is a crisis in education. Elementary school enrollment has declined more than 14 percent in the same period. Education Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieying </PERSON> told a news conference Friday the government can not devote enough money to the problems and advocated an education tax. He implied other funds should be raised through tuition and schools starting their own businesses to make money. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> as saying: `` Our biggest mistake over the last 10 years is that education has not developed sufficiently.'' He said the mistake surpassed errors that have created an inflation rate of 36 percent, the highest since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained power in 1949. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> used to take pride in free education, but has begun forcing schools to set up factories to pay expenses. Some now charge tuition to pay for books and other materials. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s news conference coincided with a session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is studying a proposal to raise the education budget by 15 percent to $ 10 billion. Last year, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> spent $ 11 a student, among the world's lowest. About one-third of all pupils now finish primary school and fewer than 10 percent of those attend high school or college. Despite a law requiring nine years of education, the average Chinese spends five years in school. Several problems have combined to create the education crisis. Agriculture policies giving land back to the peasants caused many to put their children to work. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said 8.5 percent of elementary pupils and 2.65 percent of high school students left school last year and 220 million Chinese are illiterate, most of them in rural areas. Educated Chinese are poorly paid. Starting salaries for Chinese men and women with college diplomas are about $ 29 a month, one-tenth of what a hairdresser can earn. `` This is not the kind of incentive that makes people want to get an education,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Statistics released Friday said 65.4 million youngsters were attending high school in 1978, but the figure last year was 47.6 million. On the bright side, the number of students in college increased from 856,000 to 2.7 million and the number of colleges doubled to 1,075, according to the statistics. An increasing number of graduate students are leaving school, however, to seek higher wages outside teaching and research. The physical plant also has suffered. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said more than 60 percent of the junior high schools and 90 percent of elementary schools lacked sufficient facilities and supplies last year. Many teachers are not qualified, he said, but was not specific. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said teachers are paid less than the average worker in a state-run factory. He said the responsibility rests with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or Cabinet, and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has led the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for one year. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> was education minister in 1985-88, when the commission was given responsibility for elementary and secondary schools as well as higher education.

 Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday he is seeking legislation to halt work on three offshore oil and gas lease sales in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said work on the lease sales should stop until a presidential task force finishes its analysis of the environmental impact of outer continental shelf oil and gas leasing, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public have time to review it. The lease sales involve the area off the coast of <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> counties, that portion stretching from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to the U.S.-Mexico border and the area covering the central coast area from <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said he will request the legislation April 25 in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> interior appropriations subcommittee. He said legislation is necessary because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials have said that before-lease steps for lease sales on two sections of the coast will continue and that the central section is not be to included in the task force's review. `` There is simply no point in continuing work on this sale until we have more information on the environmental impacts of offshore drilling in all critical areas of our coast,'' he said.

 A neighbor of former Premier <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> was charged Friday in the January kidnapping of the wealthy businessman, who was freed a month later after his family paid an undisclosed ransom. Officials said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Elst </PERSON>, 41, is the lawyer of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Haemers </PERSON>, an escaped convict considered the key suspect in the kidnapping. <PERSON> Haemers </PERSON> escaped from a prison transport truck in August 1987, and remains at large. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Elst </PERSON> was taken in for questioning on Thursday. He was charged Friday with kidnapping, extortion, forgery and conspiracy, officials said. <PERSON> Haemers </PERSON>' father and brother were questioned Friday, officials said. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Elst </PERSON> is the second person under arrest. <PERSON> Basri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajrami </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Metz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, last month and is to be extradited to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. On Thursday, police found <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Elst </PERSON> at his home, which is in the same <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> apartment building where <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> lives. Several men abducted the 69-year-old Christian Democrat from the building's garage as he parked his car on the evening of Jan. 14. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> was held in a dark room at a house in <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Touquet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and released in <LOCATION> Tournai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, on Feb. 13, officials say. He said he was held by as many as five armed men whose faces he never saw and with whom he communicated in writing. The kidnappers, in rambling notes to Belgian media, claimed responsibility for the abduction on behalf of a non-existing left-wing group. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>' family paid an undisclosed ransom through a Swiss bank. Belgian newspapers have put the amount at up to $ 1.6 million. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> was prime minister from 1966-68 and again from 1978-79. He also was defense minister for seven years during the 1970s. He has long been a controversial politician. In 1988, he received a three-year suspended sentence for tax fraud and forgery as head of a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> meat-packing company.

 A union representing 3,000 Education Department workers has filed a court challenge to the department's plans to begin a random drug-testing program next month The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here Thursday, is the latest of more than a half-dozen attempts by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> to block drug-testing programs in federal departments and agencies. The cases filed previously are pending at various levels of the federal court system. `` We are confident the courts will not sanction programs that randomly select government workers and require them to submit to humiliating urinalysis testing without any history or reasonable suspicion of drug abuse problems,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AFGE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON>. A union spokeswoman said the Education Department on Feb. 21 distributed to employees a notice that the testing program would begin on or after April 21. Federal agencies, as part of their compliance with an executive order issued by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requiring them to draft drug-testing programs, routinely give employees 60 days' notice before begining testing. Education Department spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> said the department had no comment on the union's suit.

 Pressing a 5-foot cross to his forehead, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> led a torchlit Good Friday procession at the Colosseum to symbolically relive <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' final agonies before his crucifixion. Before the hour-long `` Stations of the Cross'' procession began in the windy night, the pope addressed the crowd of faithful who followed him. `` Jesus is near to those who suffer and fall: to the ailing near desperation because of a relapse; to the prisoner who, for loyalty to conscience, languishes in jail and, weakened by persecution, feels himself vacillating in his certainty,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, his thin silver hair blown by the chilly wind. In a comment taken as a reference to drug abuse, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> `` supports the slaves of vice who after having abandoned the habit, fall again; he sustains those who, having been dogged by tragedies, have doubts about God.'' Then the pope, flanked by two young men holding long, lit candles, started the slow walk from the Colosseum to the edge of the ancient Roman Forum to evoke the tortures <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> suffered as he made his way to his appointment with death on <LOCATION> Calvary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> wore a crimson, gold-embroidered robe over a white cassock. The simple black cross he carried was slender and made of lightweight wood weighing about one pound. Nuns, children, foreign tourists in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for the Easter holiday, and elderly <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> women were among the many in the crowd who held prayer books and small torches during the ceremony. Italian television carried the ceremony live and said it was being shown to hundreds of millions of people around the world, although it did not name the countries. The procession, known as the Via Crucis -LRB- Latin for way of the cross -RRB- was long a papal tradition until a nearly 100-year-long interruption following the creation of the modern Italian state. Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> in 1964 revived it as a highlight of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s observance of Good Friday, the most solemn and sad day in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s liturgy At times throughout the procession, the pope closed his eyes tightly as he prayed and reflected, appearing to be feeling the pain suffered by <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. `` My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?'' a lecturer read, reciting the 14 stations of the cross, and the pope seemed particulary moved by this passage from the New Testament about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' final moments on the cross. The flames of the torches were whipped by blasts of the tramontana, a cold wind that blows down from the northern Alps over the Italian peninsula, clearing the sky but making the crowd shiver and button up their coats and jackets. Among the stations are <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' encounter with <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON>, who wipes his sweaty face with her veil, and the three times <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> stumbles and falls under the weight of the cross. The title of each station was read in seven languages: Italian, French, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and, last of all, Polish, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s native tongue. The pope spoke in Italian during the ceremony. Earlier in the day, the pope heard the confessions of six Italians and a West German religion teacher in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica in keeping with a Good Friday tradition he began 10 years ago. He heard confessions from two Italian military students, a laborer, a transport worker, a 40-year-old woman and her 12-year-old son, and the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> religion teacher. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> began hearing confessions in the basilica on Good Friday to emphasize the importance of the sacrament. No Mass is said on Good Friday, the only day in the church year without its celebration. Easter will be ushered in on Saturday night in a candlelit vigil service in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica. The pope also says a midmorning Mass for the public on Sunday.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chairman urged government officials Friday to block action on a $ 92 million loan to a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> company whose rocket-fuel chemical was found in a <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to consider freezing action on the loan in a conversation with a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman, congressional aides said.

He said the panel would hold hearings on the controversy following next week's Easter congressional recess. Acting on a tip from the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, Dutch police seized an Iranian-flag freighter in the port of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> last year. It was carrying ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in solid rocket fuels such as those powering the space shuttles' solid fuel boosters, Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a host of tactical weapons. Executives of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, said they did not know anything about plans to send the product to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s state senators were notified Friday to be prepared to sit as a jury for an expected impeachment trial against the state treasurer at the end of May. `` It would appear likely that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> will next week send us a message containing the articles of impeachment against state Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> wrote in a memorandum to his 33 colleagues. `` I would anticipate a starting date for the impeachment trial being toward the end of May, and I also anticipate it lasting three to four weeks,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said he believes two-thirds or more of the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will vote to impeach <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, 61, a two-term treasurer tangled in allegations that a fund under his supervision lost $ 279 million in 1987, and that he failed to perform the proper supervisory functions over the fund. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> has distanced himself from the losses. He testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week that he never discussed specific investment practices with his staff, did n't understand investment documents when they crossed his desk, and did n't learn of the losses until late November or early December 1988 The judiciary committee voted 19-6 Wednesday to recommend that <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> be impeached for maladministration, incompetence, neglect of duty and high crimes and misdemeanors for his role in the loss. House Judiciary Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said his committee on Monday will take up the formal articles of impeachment _ drafted along the lines suggested by Wednesday's vote _ and vote on the final document. The resolution then goes to the House. Only a simple majority is needed to recommend impeachment, which is, in effect, an indictment of the treasurer. That would go to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which would sit as a jury. It would take a two-thirds vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ 23 of 34 members _ to convict. If convicted, <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> would be forced from office and would lose his pension, estimated at the end of 1988 by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> to be at least $ 2,128 a month, the agency's acting director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crum </PERSON> said Friday The timetable for when the resolution will be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has not been resolved, <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said, but the 60-day legislative session ends April 8. The last time a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state treasurer was impeached was 1876. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleckley </PERSON>, has hinted, without elaboration, that he may file a lawsuit challenging the impeachment proceedings against his client.

 Leftist guerrillas raided two government copper mines in the Andes, killing five people and blowing up a barracks and offices, police said Friday. Miners have announced plans for a three-day nationwide strike to begin Monday, but the official gazette <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peruano </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was illegal. Unions want all contracts for <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 70,000 miners to be negotiated jointly rather than with individual companies, as is the practice now.

Both mines are are operated by state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Centromin </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s largest mining company Shining Path guerrillas have increased attacks on the mining industry, which produces more than half the nation's export earnings.

<TEXT>
 Roman Catholic church leaders marked Good Friday by calling for reconciliation among Nicaraguans and criticizing both the U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinista government. At a Good Friday procession attended by an estimated 30,000 people, Monsignor <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON>, the church spokesman, told the crowd: `` This is the year all Nicaraguans hope will bring national reconciliation.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, who led the procession commemorating <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s tortured journey to Cavalry, cried out, `` Long live <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION>, long live the pope!'' and people cheered. They cheered again when he shouted, `` One church!'' referring to the so-called Popular Church of dissident Catholics who support the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday night during a ceremony recalling <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s washing the feet of his disciples, <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said `` it would have been beautiful'' if the rebel command `` had released all its prisoners of war so they could reunite with their families. `` And it would have been a good thing if the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had declared a general amnesty to bring happiness to prisoners and their families and to contribute to national reconciliation.'' <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> urged faithful Catholics to take part in politics to provide `` an example of responsibility and service for the common good.'' The cardinal has been a frequent critic of the Sandinistas, accusing them of trying to impose a leftist government in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> against the will of the people. Some former national guard members, who were among the 1,894 freed last week by the government, joined in the Good Friday procession, and a few wore their old uniforms. Thousands of national guardsmen were imprisoned after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> gained power in 1979, ousting the right-wing regime of President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. The government said only 39 ex-guardsmen remain in jail, and they are `` very dangerous and undisciplined.'' Last week's ceremonial release of nearly 1,900 guardsmen was part of the revived Central American peace accord the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> signed in February. It includes plans to disband the Nicaraguan rebel army, believed to have about 11,000 members. Government sources claim the rebels, known as Contras, are holding at least 1,000 pro-Sandinistas prisoners, including soldiers and civilians. The Contras acknowledged last year that they held some prisoners but gave no figures.

 A Contra spokesman lauded the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's newly announced humanitarian aid plan Friday as a `` very significant step'' that will keep their fighters alive while diplomatic peace efforts are pursued. The Contras had expected they would get some continued aid, said Nicaraguan Resistance spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>. The most positive aspect of the $ 45 million aid plan announced at the White House was that it represents for the first time' ` a national policy on a bipartisan consensus,'' said <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. In addition, he said, `` We have resolved a fundamental problem which is the integrity of our combatants,'' who are encamped on the Honduran side of the Nicaraguan border. They have been existing on $ 27 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> non-lethal aid which runs out March 31. Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, perhaps the most well known resistance figure in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of his longtime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travels for his cause, was in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and could not be reached Friday by phone, said a man who answered the phone at his <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> home. Another top Contra leader, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> but could not be reached for comment at his home there. During the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the Contras were taken care of through a covert <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan even when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> halted military aid, but dissension on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and within the administration weakened their cause, Contra leaders have said. `` It's a very significant step taken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Matamoros </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now enters with the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries and other Latin American countries in this concert which enhances the possibility ... of arriving to a process of democratization in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' As to the plan's provision of money for voluntary repatriation on the part of the 11,000-member Contra army, <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> said, `` It's very clear that if there is democracy we are willing return to our country.'' But he said most of the rebels will likely wait to see how <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ruling Sandinista government lives up to its pledge for democratic reforms and free elections early next year. The Contras also want to participate in a reconciliation dialogue with the Sandinistas and the internal political opposition, <ORGANIZATION> Matamoros </ORGANIZATION> said. Previous efforts were fruitless.

 A government commission has found that thousands of skulls and bones buried in a mass grave outside <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> were those of victims killed during <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressions, not by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> soldiers, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The conclusion supports the testimony of elderly witnesses in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> who said they saw trucks that dripped blood rumbling to <LOCATION> Darnitsa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> in the 1930s, before the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> occupied the area. Earlier government estimates said the site contains from 6,000 to 68,000 bodies, but unofficial estimates said bodies of up to 300,000 people were stacked in the grave. The villagers broke five decades of terrified silence to accuse <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s secret police after the Ukrainian government erected a monument in May 1988 blaming Nazi occupiers for the crime. The villagers forced Ukrainian authorities in December to establish the commission, saying three previous investigations had covered up the truth by blaming Nazi troops. The report from <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, did not mention the earlier investigations. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulik </PERSON>, head of the investigating commission, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that investigators found family names engraved on some objects in the grave. `` Examination of the archives later confirmed that the victims were ` people's enemies' charged in the 1930s with counterrevolutionary and nationalist activity, espionage and conspiracy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Official confirmation has been given to the version that in the <LOCATION> Darnitsa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> near the village of <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> outside the <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> are buried victims of the repressions of the 1930s,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Western historians estimate 20 million Soviets were killed under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, particularly during the Great Purge of the late 1930s, but Soviet officials ignored the dark side of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for most of the past 50 years. The examination of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes begun briefly under <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was revived in 1987 under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost. Western historians also blame the Soviets for the massacre of 4,250 Polish officers unearthed in 1943 in a mass grave 310 miles away in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, Polish authorities said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s forces killed the officials, although official Soviet commissions have blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. A joint Polish-Soviet commission is examining <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and other `` blank spots'' in Soviet history. Earlier commissions on <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> had blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> for the killings even though villagers insisted the bodies were already there when the Germans occupied <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> in September 1941. Several of the villagers told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they personally dug up the graves on orders of the Germans, one of them just days after the Germans arrived. One man, <PERSON> Mikola </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON>, discovered the bones and skulls in 1987 after grave robbers had uncovered them, and set out on a personal crusade to uncover the truth. He located witnesses in <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> and won support from the Ukrainian Writers' Union and the newly formed Memorial society, which is dedicated to baring the truth of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes. <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON> was unavailable for comment Friday as he does not have a telephone. Another resident, <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukovenko </PERSON>, said he summoned the courage to speak after a Soviet commission reburied the bones and erected the memorial blaming the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview last month, <PERSON> Kukovenko </PERSON> said a German officer forced him and four other men to exhume the site four days after Nazi troops occupied the area in 1941. `` When they -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- put up this monument, I became ashamed that they were blaming this on the wrong people,'' said <PERSON> Kukovenko </PERSON>, 74.

 Sikh militants in the northwestern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> raided the house of a Sikh woman and killed her and six members of her family, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. At least seven others were killed in other militant-related violence in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, another news agency. More than 455 people have been killed in such violence so far this year, officials say. According to Press Trust, militants raided the house of <LOCATION> Dhan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kaur </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Katran </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, about 280 miles northwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The militants fired guns and killed <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON>, two of her sons, three daughters and a daughter-in-law, the news agency said. It said police blamed members of the radical `` <ORGANIZATION> Bhindranwale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'' for the slayings. The group is one of about a dozen underground militias based in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> fighting for a separate Sikh state. Sikhs make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population but hold a slight majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a prosperous farming state. Militants have killed thousands of Hindus and moderate Sikhs in their insurgency for an independent Sikh nation since 1982. They say they are discriminated against by the country's <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> majority, which makes up 82 percent of the population. The federal government, in an effort to curb the violence, dissolved the state government in May 1987 and put <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> under federal rule. But authorities say Sikh militants killed at least 2,400 last year, more than double the number killed in 1987.

<TEXT>
 The leftist Sandinista government on Friday condemned the bipartisan plan President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to renew humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. Foreign Ministry Secretary-General <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> called the plan drafted by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and congressional leaders `` confusing and unclear'' and said it goes against a regional pact that calls for dismantling the rebel force by mid-May. `` Humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a contradiction in terms,'' <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> said at a news conference, where journalists had been told President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was to speak. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s absence was not explained. <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, presidential information minister, read a communique from the Nicaraguan government which said in part that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government drafted the plan `` in order to save face while it proceeds to dismantle its failed policy against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s sovereignty and integrity.'' Answering journalists' questions later, <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> said of the plan: `` We want to believe this is indeed a positive step, because there are other steps ahead'' where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can show its support of the peace accord that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> reached in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Feb. 14. In the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> accord the five presidents agreed to draft a program by mid-May to dismantle the Contras, as the Nicaraguan rebel force is known, and help them return to civilian life. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also agreed to electoral and other reforms to guarantee fair general elections, which he moved up by 10 months to Feb. 25, 1990. In speaking of `` other steps ahead,'' <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> said he was referring to support needed from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force sent to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and independent observers to the Nicaraguan elections, both part of the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> pact. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as one of the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, can veto the measure. <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> called the vote `` an acid test'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intentions toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted in February 1988 to cut off military aid to the Contras, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began arming in 1981, and continue only food, shelter, medical and other non-lethal assistance. The bipartisan agreement announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday calls for $ 45 million in new aid through February 1990 for the estimated 11,000 Contras living in Honduran jungle camps near the Nicaraguan border with an equal number of relatives. The expressed intent of the aid renewal is to put pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to comply with the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> pact. The current $ 27.1 million aid package to the rebels runs out March 31. The new aid is expected to be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> soon after it returns from its Easter break next month. `` There is an inconsistency in these two documents -LRB- the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> pact and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bilateral Contra aid plan -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> said. `` Either you approve the dismantling of the Contras or you do n't.'' He said that regardless of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> aid plan, the Central American presidents will meet their mid-May deadline for the Contra dismantling plan. Since the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> accord, the Nicaraguan government has released nearly 1,900 former members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, most of whom were jailed after a revolution that brought the Sandinistas to power July 19, 1979. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> also sent to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> a list of reforms on electoral and other laws, as part of the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> accord. Passage of the reforms is virtually assured because the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, with 61 deputies, control the unicameral 96-member assembly. The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a temporary cease-fire in March 1988 which has been broken by sporadic skirmishes. he plan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Friday stipulates that aid can be suspended if the Contras attack <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or if the presence of the Contras is deemed detrimental to the Central American peace process.

 Hundreds of Christian pilgrims wept, prayed and sang hymns along the Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in a Good Friday procession that retraced <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s path to his crucifixion. About a dozen devotees carried heavy wooden crosses to symbolize <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s walk of agony, and many knelt for communal prayers at the 14 stations that mark the route. A costumed American group, complete with a thorn-crowned Christ figure, performed along the way. A minor scuffle broke out when <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> groups crossed paths, each demanding right of way. The turnout was considerably lower than in past years, reflecting fears over the 15-month Palstinian revolt that has torn the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and spilled into Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. No major violence was reported. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, at least 11 people were nailed to crosses and thousands of Filipinos drew blood by beating themselves on the back to symbolize the suffering of Christ. About 5,000 people attended in ritual in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Citud </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> heard confessions from worshipers in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica before carrying a 5-foot wooden cross in a Good Friday procession to symbolically relive <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' final agonies before his crucifixion Before the hour-long procession, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told the crowd: `` Jesus is near to those who suffer and fall.'' In a comment taken as a reference to drug abuse, he said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> `` supports the slaves of vice who after having abandoned the habit, fall again; he sustains those who, having been dogged by tragedies, have doubts about God.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, scores of city police and paramilitary border forces armed with automatic rifles, tear gas grenades and riot batons were moved into the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to ensure security for worshipers. The <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> contains sites holy to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, Christianity and <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, and is part of territory seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The procession swept through the Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION>, or Street of Sorrows, to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where tradition holds <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was buried after dying at the hands of the Roman rulers of the Holy Land. The main procession was led by 20 Roman Catholic Franciscan monks. About 600 worshipers followed, a fraction of the crowd that traditionally participates. A scuffle broke out when the procession crossed the path of a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group moving in another direction. Police stepped in to stop fistfights, then quickly set up a barricade. A guitarist accompanied Spanish devotees, whose songs echoed in the narrow alleys. Palestinian Arabs sang hymns in Arabic, a contrast to the Islamic call to prayer that rang out from the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s mosques. `` You just feel you are part of a tremendous movement, this Christian religion, no matter what denomination it might be,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberlein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who came with 10 other Roman Catholics. `` To see all colors here, all believing the same thing you believe, it's just very exhilerating, spiritually moving.'' A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> group provided the street theater. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> portrayed <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, his head crowned with thorns. His companions, dressed as Roman guards, pretended to flog him as he dragged a wooden cross through the streets. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Petranela </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, costumed as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>, ran among astonished onlookers shouting, `` It's all my fault.'' A German pilgrim from <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON>, termed the show `` a disgrace to Christianity.'' Even though this year's turnout was smaller, the crowds still proved too much for <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Prentice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` It is difficult to move around easily, and it would be nicer if it was a little quieter,'' she said. `` You need peace and quiet to pray. I may come back tomorrow.''

It will be the first official visit to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> by a Soviet leader, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, will visit <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from April 5-7. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in December after his visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but postponed the trip to rush to earthquake-devastated <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. British officials say <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will spend much of the time in talks dominated by East-West relations, human rights and disarmament. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> exchanged ambassadors for the first time in 1974. The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country won partial independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1921, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was the first country to recognize its republican government. The republicans negotiated with Soviet diplomats, but failed to get an agreement on establishing diplomatic links. In September 1983, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> barred the Soviet state airline, <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, from picking up or discharging passengers at <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> for 60 days to protest the shooting down of a South Korean airliner over Soviet airspace.

 Acting Air Force Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> announced late Friday he will step down later this spring to seek a job in the private sector. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> has served as the under secretary, or No. 2, man, in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s heirarchy since November 1986 and as the acting secretary since last December. An associate of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> had been widely expected to take on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> post on a permanent basis had Tower been confirmed as the secretary of defense. Tower's nomination was rejected two weeks ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replaced him with former <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> congressman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` In a meeting I had with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> earlier this week, I indicated that I was inclined to return to the private sector so that I could finally give my two daughters the attention they deserve and to pursue several other professional interests,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. `` Without making any commitments, Secretary <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> asked that we both keep our options open. However, today I indicated to Secretary <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> my preference for leaving public service ...'' An aide said <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> is planning to leave in May. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>'s announcement comes one day after administration sources disclosed <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> is also unlikely to keep his post in a new <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> line-up.

The aide to <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, who asked not to be named, insisted that controversy involving Gen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> had played no role in <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>'s decision. `` All this happened earlier in the week and there's no tie-in,'' said the aide. `` He's been thinking about it for a long time.'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is a graduate of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.

 Authorities have arrested a prominent student leader and will act against political parties involved in any anti-government demonstrations, the government said Friday. The arrest Thursday of Min Ko <PERSON> Naing </PERSON> was the first of a well known student activist since military commander <PERSON> Gen </PERSON>. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a coup in September. Government spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said that from March 15-21, Min Ko <PERSON> Naing </PERSON> made seven anti-government speeches at offices of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a major political party headed by dissident leaders Tin Oo and <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>. The student also violated the ban on public gatherings, <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said. `` Min Ko <PERSON> Naing </PERSON> and his groups have repeatedly violated the law, inciting the people to disrupt the peace and tranquility in the country,'' he said at a news conference. `` They were also planning to disrupt the forthcoming Armed Forces Day celebrations on March 27.'' `` Action will also be taken against political parties involved in these anti-government activities,'' <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said. Students took a leading role in street demonstrations last year aimed at ending a quarter century of authoritarian rule in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has advised its employees against flying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers on some routes until the end of next month because of the government warning about a possible hijacking in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` On the basis of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- alert, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> notified its employees to avoid traveling on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> until the end of April,'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Colette </PERSON> <PERSON> Abissi </PERSON> said Friday. She said the notification was issued Thursday through the company's internal security channels. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> employs 163,904 people outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is strictly up to employees to decide what travel arrangements to make, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Thursday it had issued a security bulletin to airports and carriers March 16 about `` the possibility of a hijacking of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The warning did not mention any specific airline or airport that might be threatened, nor did it cite any time for the warning, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The White House has sought to calm anxiety about the bulletin, which leaked in a front-page newspaper story in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials said the bulletin was similar to many other terrorist alerts and travelers `` should be confident that all reasonable precautions are being taken.'' Security also was strengthened this week at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> because of the warning, although it specified <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, airport officials said. `` We have the ability to react to any type of situation,'' said airport manager <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yee </PERSON>. Meanwhile, a spot check of travel agents did not find that travelers were reacting by altering their reservations. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Berens </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Revere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said he was unaware of any customers seeking to change their travel plans. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teison </PERSON>, editor and publisher of two travel newsletters including <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, said `` My feeling is that the majority of people will not pay attention to it'' if they already are booked on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline. `` If reservations are already made, they will let them sit,'' said <PERSON> Teison </PERSON>. `` But in making reservations they will lean toward making them on a foreign carrier.''

<HEAD>Easter Travelers Fly Despite Warning; No Severe Delays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 European airport officials indicated severe delays were averted Friday because travelers, aware of reports that a hijacking might be attempted, checked in early and faced extra luggage searches calmly. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> warned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines of a possible hijack by Palestinian terrorists in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this weekend. A <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper disclosed the warning Thursday, angering the American government, which feared its sources might be compromised. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which employs 163,904 people outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, advised them not to fly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines on European and <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> routes until the end of April. Police at <LOCATION> Leonardo </LOCATION> da Vinci Airport in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> warning prompted increased security and that more staff members were checking bags and working in the metal-detecting section. No takeoff delays were reported, and reservations agents at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline counters said the number of cancellations was not unusual. Security experts in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> also were wary because of the approaching anniversary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on April 15, 1986. On April 14 last year, a bomb exploded a USO in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, killing an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman and four other people. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was blamed. <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>, the Italian news agency, quoted Libyan Ambassador <PERSON> Abdulrahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalgam </PERSON> as telling reporters Friday that allegations of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement in attacks allegedly planned were an `` absurdity.'' At <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport, passengers found themselves in long lines as bags were carefully searched and their owners questioned. Some passengers traveling on American lines faced double checks, by the airport staff and the airlines. Airlines tightened security after the bombing Dec. 21 of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, in which 270 people were killed. Most travelers appeared to have arrived early, as suggested, and delays generally were limited to a little more than an hour. `` I think most people have been well informed and are taking advice about arriving early and not carrying electrical equipment,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>, manager of customer services at British Airways Terminal 4. Investigators say the Flight 103 bomb was in a radio-cassette player. British airports now insist that small electronic and electrical goods be inspected and carried in hand baggage. At <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION>, the other <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> airport, officials reported delays up to four hours but said most flights took off on time. One traveler said on British <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> television: `` We just keep our fingers crossed. That's all you can do.'' The situation was complicated by a 90-minute fault in an air traffic control computer in the morning, which delayed flights at airports in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, an airport spokeswoman said increased security was in effect and some flights were held up, but the delays were not `` of a substantial nature.'' <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport officials said security always is tight, and a spokeswoman said: `` we had normal delays which had nothing to do with extra security.'' A <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> airport official said security checks were slightly more rigorous than normal, particularly on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, but flights were not delayed. Airport authorities in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> said security measures had been `` quietly beefed up,'' but caused no delays or cancellations. French police in charge of air transport reported nothing unusual at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> airports. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, security officials said the warning had not affected standing rules, which require teams of armed paramilitary Civil Guards and police to be on duty at all times at major airports. Control tower spokesmen at <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s Barajas airport and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prat </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> reported no delays Friday in international arrivals.

 A black Republican group is refusing to attend next month's `` African-American Summit'' led by a group of prominent blacks because of the possible participation of <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. In a letter Friday to former presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said he and the 150 members of his group would not take part because the philosophies of <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and black militants <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> `` are offensive to us.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s organization is an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is an honorary chairman of the African-American Summit which is scheduled for April 21-23 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Other honorary chairmen include <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> head <ORGANIZATION> Benjamin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hooks </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Height </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, former mayor of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, is the general chairman of the bi-partisan summit which has the stated purpose of developing an `` African-American agenda'' for the next four years. The coordinator of the summit, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hixson </PERSON>, confirmed that <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> had been asked to participate as a panelist on black families, but said she did not know about any participation by <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>. She said the summit organizers have not received a response from <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. A spokesman for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was on the board of the summit but was not involved in organizing it or inviting people. `` He has nothing to do with the planning of it,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Easter </PERSON>, who added however that the idea for the summit was raised at a black leadership meeting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> held in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in December. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in the leter to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with a copy to <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, said that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> group `` can not serve on, nor participate in, the African-American summit as long as these individuals are associated with the cause.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s letter says that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Jan. 27 informed the summit steering committee that he also `` could not be associated with this undertaking if these same individuals were allowed to be official summit speakers.'' The committee voted to exclude <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and tabled the issue of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, the letter said. Subsequently, according to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s letter, `` some individuals have fought diligently to have them included in the summit.'' `` I feel that the move to revisit the question of participation of these three individuals has been a breach of faith - not on your part, but on the part of others,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> became an issue in his 1984 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, because <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> referred to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> as a `` dirty religion.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> dissociated himself from <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s remarks but did not rebuke him. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> played no role in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1988 campaign. <PERSON> Hixson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> was selected as a panelist `` because he does play a prominent role'' in black family issues. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> black radical, and <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, were leaders in the militant black power movement on the 1960s. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> officials were unfamiliar with the summit or the controversy, and had no comment on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s action except to say that `` from all we've heard, his reasoning is sound.''

<HEAD>Pakistani In Hiding For Plans To Translate Rushdie's Book</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Pakistani living in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> said Friday he has gone into hiding after receiving death threats for planning to translate <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book `` The Satanic Verses.'' Police speculated that a Malaysian slain in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> early Wednesday was mistaken for the Pakistani poet, <PERSON> Yousaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jhelumi </PERSON>. The Malaysian was knifed from behind for no apparent reason close to <PERSON> Jhelumi </PERSON>'s apartment in a northern <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Jhelumi </PERSON>, 36, a Moslem, told Swedish television he received death threats after announcing plans last month to translate `` The Satanic Verses'' into his mother tongue, <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION> is the chief language of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the book has been banned and violently denounced. <PERSON> Jhelumi </PERSON> closed his small shop after receiving the threats and has since moved from hotel to hotel, he said. `` I want to make it clear to Moslems in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> that nothing in the book goes against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jhelumi </PERSON> said. He was interviewed in a hotel room at an unidentified location. He said he would only start translating the book if he got police protection. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book has been banned in many Moslem countries and the Indian-born British author has been condemned to death by <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leaders, who say `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam. The book includes a brothel scene in which the prostitutes take the names of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives, and it suggests <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jhelumi </PERSON> said he considered the book an attack `` against the conservative mullahs who wanted to see the world as old-fashioned as it was during the time of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>.'' `` The fanatics can wring my neck, but they ca n't wring history,'' he said. <PERSON> Jhelumi </PERSON> said he has been denounced in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and his relatives there have been threatened with being socially ostracized.

 A judge set a $ 100,000 bond Friday for <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, one of two Indian activists acquitted of federal charges and later charged by the state for holding up to 20 hostages at a newspaper last year. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 20, was returned from <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, Thursday night to face 14 second-degree kidnapping charges. He dropped his fight against extradition Wednesday after a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> appeals court refused to block the order sending him home. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannon </PERSON> set bond for <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and appointed him a lawyer during a hearing at the courthouse barely a block from The Robesonian newspaper, where <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> held hostages for 10 hours on Feb. 1, 1988. Both were found innocent of federal hostage-taking and firearms violations after a three-week trial in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> last October. But they were indicted by a <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury last December on state kidnapping charges. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> fled soon afterward to the Onondaga Indian reservation south of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, but was captured Dec. 13 after a high-speed chase. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, but fled the state after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 25,000 bond for him. He first went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, then to an Indian reservation in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> tried earlier this month to seek political asylum at the Soviet consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But the Soviets rejected his plea and turned him out of their building, allowing federal agents to arrest him. He is being held in a jail in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' family said they would find the money to get him released `` The money is no problem,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>'s mother `` <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> was hoping to be home for Easter. But with the holiday today and the short amount of notice we had, we just did n't have everything ready. A bond can be secured with cash or a deed to property. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' parents own their own home in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> The two <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> said they took over the newspaper to draw attention to their charges of official corruption and drug-dealing by <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials. A state task force formed as a result of the takeover found no evidence to support those allegations. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said before his court appearance he would plead guilty to one of the kidnapping counts, provided he received probation with no prison sentence. He said he would not testify against <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 31. District Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, who made no comments opposing bond for <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, said he would not accept that kind of plea bargain. `` I do n't think we're interested in that at this point,'' <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> said. `` We feel all of the charges need to be disposed of. It might be something we would discuss at a later time, but not now.'' <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> said he hoped to try <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> at the same time. A decision is expected Monday whether to return <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to face a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution or to drop the federal charge and begin extradition proceedings on the state charges in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said this week that <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> was abandoning `` the cause'' by dropping his extradition battle in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said Friday she had hoped her son would continue that fight, but she understood why he dropped it. `` He said he just got tired of fighting and wanted to get it over with,'' she said. `` I can understand that.''

 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who found winning congressional confirmation as defense secretary easy, had less luck finding his car. He told reporters on Friday how, in his first day on the job last Saturday, he had set out from his office to get his car. What he got was lost _ in the basement of the world's largest office building. Asked how he was finding the Pentagon building, which covers 29 acres, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> recounted: `` On Saturday, I guess it was, I was scheduled for a meeting with the president ... over in the residence at the White House. `` I went out and got on the elevator in the secretary's suite and went down to get in the car. And, when I went down in the elevator, the doors opened and I stepped out the doors, the doors closed behind me and there was no car there. `` I was in the basement of the Pentagon. It was a bit disconcerting because I turned around to look for a button to push to get the elevator. `` The fact is, of course, they do n't want strangers wandering into the secretary's suite by being able to punch in in the basement. So I was lost in the basement of the Pentagon. I wandered around for a few minutes, worried that I was going to miss the meeting with the president. `` I finally found the stairs up to the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Entrance </LOCATION>, and the car was parked outside at that time at the River Entrance. `` Of course, people were running around out there wondering what happened to the secretary. But I sort of tightened my tie and walked out like I knew exactly where I was and arrived outside, and nobody had the nerve to ask me where the hell I'd been all that time.'' `` Have you got a new chauffeur?'' a reporter asked. `` The chauffeur's all right,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> replied. `` I'm worried about the guy who runs the elevator.''

<TEXT>
 A fifth-grader's science fair project on AIDS won her an `` A'' but was sequestered in the principal's office when school officials feared exposing students to a discussion about the deadly disease. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldree </PERSON>, principal at <ORGANIZATION> Waveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, kept <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Eades </PERSON>' project from appearing at the school's science fair and a regional competition earlier this week. He also refused to allow anyone to look at it, including teachers and parents. `` Students are required to verbally ` defend' their projects for the judges, and we felt it would be a severe imposition to expect judges to have to question a 10-year-old girl about such a project,'' he said. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>'s project, a pegboard with AIDS spelled in red letters across it and pasted with magazine articles, earned her a blue ribbon and an `` A'' grade, but <PERSON> Baldree </PERSON> said two teachers decided the project did not meet science fair rules. The rules disallow projects on vertebrate animals and on physical matters relating to humans. But there was also worry about the display's sensitive subject matter, he said. `` Other fair participants usually listen in when the judges ask questions _ students all the way down to kindergarten _ and we did n't think it would be right to expose children of those young ages to that kind of discussion.'' <PERSON> Baldree </PERSON> described the project as sexually explicit. The articles included information on how acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most often spread _ through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> said she had planned a project on the human heart. `` I was looking through some books and found a lot of information on AIDS. It's a disease anybody can get, so I decided that would be a better project,'' she said. <PERSON> Teona </PERSON> <PERSON> Eades </PERSON>, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>'s mother, said she was n't aware the project did not meet the rules until a coordinator told her it was unacceptable. `` We have no problem with -LRB- the school officials' -RRB- actions; they had to follow the rules,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Eades </PERSON> said. `` But if those rules are going to shield our children from reality, that's not very scientific.'' <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> said she thought fourth - and fifth-graders should have been able to see the project because `` we are already talking about AIDS. She said her project could have helped educate other students about the disease.

<HEAD>More Fruit Cleared For Import</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Friday cleared the way for more Chilean fruit _ apples, peaches and plums _ to be sold to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets after they are inspected for evidence of cyanide poisoning. Import restrictions were lifted on pears and nectarines from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and on grapes and berries last Friday, allowing the fruit to be released for sale after 5 percent of each shipment is inspected and found free from cyanide. Grapes, which constitute 70 percent of the fruit <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> sends to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, began appearing on produce shelves of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores this week after a two-week absence due to the cyanide-poisoning scare. More than 1 million cases of grapes and various types of berries have been inspected at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> docks and airports and sent to retailers since the hold on those fruits was lifted, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Food graders should begin inspecting Chilean apples, peaches and plums by the weekend, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` The public should be reassured that the government has kept everyone informed and has moved promptly both to protect the public health and to restore to the marketplace a healthy component of the balanced diet that we recommend,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> also exports melons to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at this time of year, but <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said `` it is not clear whether they will be returned to the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- market or not this season.'' Chilean fruit was removed from store shelves and unsold supplies were held in warehouses, at ports, and on ships after the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> found traces of cyanide in two seedless red grapes. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> began looking for evidence of cyanide tampering after two telephone calls to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in the Chilean capital of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> threatened to inject the poison into fruit exports. An estimated $ 50 million to $ 75 million worth of Chilean fruit that could not be readily inspected had to be destroyed. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> conducted tests on the different fruits to identify the detectable damage caused by cyanide injections, so inspectors would know what to look for. Evidence of cyanide poisoning includes discoloration and deterioration of the fruit, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said, and the agency advised consumers to examine fruit as a precaution, including the area at the stem, for discolorations and punctures. Inspectors have found no further cyanide contamination in any of the fruit from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, despite a third telephone threat that was received last Friday, shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> announced its stepped-up inspection plan to return Chilean fruit to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said Friday he and President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reached complete agreement in talks on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s drive for a multiparty system and increasing calls for neutrality. `` There were no issues in our three-hour discussion where we had differences in our views,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference. Reforms began earlier in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> than in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and have progressed further, making it both a laboratory for economic and social experiments in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and a source of worry for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> over whether <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> is going too far. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> arrived Thursday on his first visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since Hungarian party leaders last month declared their support for a multiparty system. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said he explained the decision to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and added, `` This is strictly up to the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> people and the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> leadership.'' `` It is natural that the political structure of a country develop in its own particular way,'' he said. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said that neither a one-party system, prevalent in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, nor a multiparty system either ensures or precludes democracy. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> remains intolerant of any challenge, is seeking to implement reforms based on its own history, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said. Hungarian Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said after visiting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> early this month that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> approved <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reforms and does not oppose introduction of a multiparty system there. Despite sanctioning competition, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said he does not anticipate becoming leader of an opposition party. The Hungarian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` is sure to win a leading role. I'm not thinking of being an opposition leader, I'm thinking of being the leader of the winning party.'' Asked about growing demands in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for neutrality, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said, `` We are continually working for elimination of the two military blocs on the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> continent. If that happens, there will be no question about the neutrality of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.'' `` We met complete unanimity of views'' with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said. The Hungarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> that present world circumstances do not give any <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> members a chance to be neutral. The two leaders also expressed their support for a continuing re-evaluation of the Soviet invasion that crushed the Hungarian uprising of 1956, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said. In order for the two sides to form an accurate record, historians on both sides must gain access to documents of the period, he said. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s support is necessary to ensure that the historians who are looking into this matter get a look at authentic documents,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said. The Tass new agency said the focus of the meeting was an `` exchange of expertise and information about pressing issues of socialist construction in both countries and the development of cooperation in all areas.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its message favoring abortion rights was refused by more than two dozen radio stations in five northeastern cities. `` It never occurred to us that we would n't be able to place paid ads on a subject that's on everyone's lips. It is the issue of the day in terms of women's rights,'' <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, the president of NOW, said at a news conference. NOW budgeted about $ 40,000 to place the 60-second spot on 35 stations in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Eight stations agreed to carry the spot and 26 declined; one station had not decided, Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. The spot was aimed at promoting an April 9 march in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supporting the right to abortion. Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said organizers expected as many as 250,000 people to attend. NOW's advertisement was produced to sound like a newscast, with an announcer setting a scene, followed by clips of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voicing their opposition to abortion. In the ad, actress <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> concludes with the warning that `` A woman's right to choose now hangs in the balance.'' Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said the radio stations had refused to run the advertisement because of its controversial content. `` It's like the stupid decision that's made on condoms. They wo n't talk about condoms, they wo n't show them on TV, and now they're not going to talk about abortion,'' she said. However, executives at several radio stations that declined to accept the advertising spot said they were bothered not by its content but because of the format. `` We wo n't take anything if they're trying to simulate a newscast. You ca n't fake a newscast,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> WINS-AM </ORGANIZATION>, an all-news station in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Messerman </PERSON>, national sales manager for WXKS-FM, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> station playing contemporary hit music, said the station refused to air the ad because of its newscast format and sound effects. `` It has exploding bombs, sirens, just things you do n't want to have on copy. We thought that this was a spot that was going to cause people to tune out,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has moved swiftly to capture some of the business abandoned by strikebound sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, but it disputes union claims that its moves are part of a master plan to grow at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s expense. Amid its own labor problems _ flight attendants on Friday ended a four-day walkout that had little impact on service _ <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> has added flights on routes vacated by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, taken over <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> gates at some airports and waged an aggressive ad campaign to attract more <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> passengers. Industry observers say the Houston-based airline has gained passengers and revenue, but no more so than other competitors since Eastern virtually shut down after the March 4 strike by its <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union and subsequent walkouts by pilots and flight attendants. `` Every carrier that still flies will be doing better now than they were before the strike, with the exception of some of the commuter lines who may have been feeding into Eastern flights,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` So <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> will certainly see benefits, but I think that there are a number of carriers who will have far greater benefits than <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. Eastern is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> extended an order Friday forcing rival airlines to honor agreements governing ticket, baggage and cargo transfers essential to keeping strike-crippled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> airborne. He also barred the striking Machinists from picketing on Eastern property at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Separately, a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> told a lower court to reconsider the airline's request that it force Eastern pilots back to work. Eastern's unions have claimed that the parent of the two airlines, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has been trying to funnel <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, a largely non-union carrier. The Machinists and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have asked the federal bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee to govern <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s daily operations and business transactions, removing company management from that role. The unions also allege that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is using <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> as a profit-generating tool against the striking workers. But <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials say they _ like other airlines _ simply are responding to consumer demand created by the strike. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> has added eight flights out of its <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> hub, nine additional flights on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> routes abandoned by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and a new <LOCATION> Cleveland-Miami </LOCATION> route. The carrier also took over eight Eastern landing slots at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and eight at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, under what <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> describes as a 60-day lease. `` These added flights are simply to help us address demand in the marketplace, and this really is no different from what other carriers out there are doing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is `` using <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> like a war machine'' to offset the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strike, increasing revenues and expanding <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> permanently into <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s markets. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to offset <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s losses for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> was limited `` There are some short-term advantages to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> as they pick up some additional flights and passengers, just as there are to other airlines,'' <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON> said. `` But the advantage through <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> from a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> point of view will come nowhere near making up for what is being lost at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as a result of the strike and the bankruptcy filing.'' Eastern is averaging just over 100 flights daily, compared with 1,040 daily before the strike. Continental officials had no available figures on profits since the Eastern strike began. `` When they release their March traffic results we'll be able to make some judgments,'' said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldutis </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Other analysts said that while there are some clear winners in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strike, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> appears to be a lesser player. `` Some are obviously seeing benefits, not the least of which is <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' operations in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. `` Delta and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> have had about 90 percent of the market there with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> holding about 55 or 60 percent, so with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> down, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> does not face a large amount of competition,'' he said. Also, <PERSON> James </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has doubled its operations on the lucrative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Washington-Boston </ORGANIZATION> shuttle during peak periods. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> have capitalized on flights between the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>.

 A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday extended an order forcing rival airlines to honor agreements governing ticket, baggage and cargo transfers essential to keeping strike-crippled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> airborne. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> also barred striking Machinists from picketing on Eastern property at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Separately, a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> told a lower court to reconsider the airline's request that it force Eastern pilots back to work. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' flight attendants terminated a four-day strike that had little apparent effect on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister carrier. The developments came on the 21st day of a walkout by the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union being honored by pilots and flight attendants. Eastern is operating a limited schedule on its Northeast shuttle and on Latin and South American routes. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said in bankruptcy court that the airline was negotiating with rivals to maintain interline agreements that allow passengers and bags to make connecting flights on different carriers. Eastern said that without cooperation among carriers, its few services would be crippled. The pacts do not govern agreements with other airlines honoring Eastern tickets purchased before the strike. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> granted a two-week extension to an order that competitors honor the agreements. `` We've had very substantial discussions and negotiations with the major carriers,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for marketing, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. `` They're all willing to resolve this.'' <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> also barred picketing on a 150-yard-long sidewalk in front of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s terminal at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after the airline complained Machinists were trespassing on private property. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> said the union was notifying flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister airline, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, to return to work. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said no flights were disrupted or canceled because of the walkout. It said 200 flight attendants took part; the union reported more than 1,200 strikers. The union, which represents more than 6,000 flight attendants, called the walkout Monday to protest what it said were substandard wages and working conditions at the carrier. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> told a lower court judge that he had the authority to rule whether the walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,600 pilots constitutes a primary or secondary strike. Eastern earlier this month asked the judges to overturn a lower court ruling permitting the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to honor striking Machinists' picket lines under the Railway Labor Act of 1926. `` A claim of a sympathy strike can not be used as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the Railway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said. It said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has the authority to rule on what kind of strike the pilots are engaged in. The <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> said it is buying advertising this weekend in major newspapers in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to publicize its position and deter other pilots from going to work for Eastern. The advertisement describes the alleged pitfalls of working for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, including limited career opportunities and low pay scales, and says: `` Pilots choose your career opportunities wisely.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> suspended its search for a 52-foot sport fishing boat Friday night after almost 24 hours of battling rough seas and poor visibility with no success, a spokesman said. `` We have n't got any new information,'' Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. `` As of about six o'clock, the units that are out there will finish their search patterns and come back in.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said the area had been thoroughly and unsuccessfully searched by three <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters, two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter.

The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> received a distress call Thursday night saying the Blue Goose, with 10 people aboard, was sinking off the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coast. About an hour later, the boat radioed that it was taking on water about five miles off <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and that the occupants had donned life jackets and were abandoning the vessel. The Coast Guard advised the people to stay together but received no acknowledgement of that transmission. Driving rain, 50-knot winds and seas of 6 to 8 feet were reported about the time the distress call was received. An all-night search turned up no sign of the boat or its passengers. Water temperatures were in the 40s, which could cause hypothermia in anyone who was overboard, said Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Covington </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> searched boat registrations in every <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> state and found no record of a vessel named the Blue Goose that matches the description of the fishing vessel, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. `` If it's not a documented vessel and all we have is the name, it's hard for us to track down the information,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said the distress call sounded legitimate and they had no reason to believe the call was a hoax. `` We do n't know that this is a hoax, but there have been hoaxes before,'' said Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Blando </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Sixth Death In Meningococcus Outbreak</HEAD>

 Health officials said Friday they will begin vaccinating up to 4,000 people after an infant became the sixth person to die in an outbreak of meningococcal disease. <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health officials also conferred with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on how to deal with about 400 participants from seven states at a basketball tournament underway in nearby <PERSON> Wapato </PERSON>. Teams at the all-Indian tournament, which began Wednesday, are from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Health officials want to ensure they do not carry the disease back to their states. Options include quarantining participants, vaccinating them, or sending them home with no treatment, said Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, county health director. Dr. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenger </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said a quarantine was unlikely because the risk of participants contracting the disease is very low. It was a discouraging day for health officials, who on Wednesday said they felt they were through the worst of the nation's largest current outbreak of meningococcal disease. The meningococcus germ is carried in the nose and throat and passed through sneezing and other secretions from the nose and mouth. It is not considered highly contagious. In the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> outbreak, the germ is causing bacterial meningitis, an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, and <LOCATION> meningococcemia </LOCATION>, in which it travels through the blood stream and attacks organs. Adults who become infected usually do not become sick, but can carry the disease to children. Symptoms are similar to the common cold, and include fever, nausea, headache and a rash. An unidentified infant died Thursday in the latest case, making it the 18th since Jan. 10. Of the six deaths, four were infants. The state had only four deaths from meningococcal disease in all of 1988. `` This suggests there is a high rate of carriers in the county,'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> told an emergency meeting of the county health board. That is troubling because the basketball tournament has drawn large crowds, who have mingled with the out-of-town visitors, making it impossible to do conventional contact-tracing techniques to identify those most at risk of exposure, he said. As a result, health officials planned to vaccinate everyone between ages 1 to 25 in the <LOCATION> Wapato </LOCATION> area on Friday and Saturday, a total of about 4,000 people, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said. The vaccine does not work on people under age 1 and people over 25 who are exposed rarely become ill, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said. Most of the deaths in the outbreak have involved Hispanics or Native Americans, and the common denominator is low-income families living in crowded conditions, officials said.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defense chief said Friday that a new round of talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on the FSX fighter project started with disagreement. `` The contents of the talks were very tough,'' <PERSON> Kichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. Agency Deputy Director <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, met Thursday to discuss the joint development of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next generation jet fighter plane. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said this week he endorsed joint production of the FSX fighter but with some changes to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology. His decision followed criticism that the plan amounted to a giveaway of up to $ 8 billion worth of American technology. <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON> said, however, that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should stick to the terms of the original agreement signed in November. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s major defense contractor, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft maker <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would develop the new fighter. Nishihiro, scheduled to remain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until Sunday, will continue to hold meetings with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> originally planned to develop the fighter independently but negotiated a joint development agreement after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> put pressure on <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to buy U.S.-built planes. American critics, however, have warned that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology for the plane could help <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> compete against American companies in the manufacture of civilian aircraft, a high-technology field in which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now lags but has targeted for development. Under the development agreement, reached after several years of negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> would be responsible for developing the new fighter by using technology developed domestically and from the F-16, developed by the St. Louis-based <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. General Dynamics would receive 35 percent to 40 percent of the contract in the developmental stage. Initially, 130 planes would be built, with a possible follow-up order for about 100 more. Each FSX would cost about $ 40 million, Japanese officials say.

 Americans' personal income shot up 1 percent last month while consumer spending advanced at a more restrained pace, boosting the savings rate to its highest level in nearly three years, the government said Friday. Personal income, bolstered by strong growth in employment and wages, has posted two straight solid gains, rising to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.32 trillion last month after surging 1.7 percent in January, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. But when it comes to spending that money, consumers have been showing more restraint. Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.5 percent in February to an annual rate of $ 3.38 trillion after advancing 0.4 percent in January. `` The consumer is still getting a lot of dollars placed in his wallet,' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` But when it came to spending, consumers suddenly have decided this income is not going to be disbursed as lavishly as it has been.'' The uneven advances in income and spending resulted in a healthy jump in the personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ to 5.9 percent from 5.4 percent in the previous month. February's rate matched the savings level set in April 1986 and has n't been surpassed since May 1985, when the rate was 6.4 percent. The rate has been on the increase since it hit a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987. Analysts said the latest report on personal income and spending demonstrated that the economy continued to show strength last month even as some signs of a slowdown emerge. Most analysts expect the economy to cool this year as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> continues to push up interest rates in an effort to restrain growth and keep inflation in check. `` There are already a few signs that higher interest rates are cooling off the overall economy, which means fewer jobs being generated in the months ahead and smaller income gains,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We will continue to see consumer spending expanding, but at a more modest rate.'' Last month's gain in income included a large increase in farm subsidy payments. But excluding that effect, income still rose a healthy 0.7 percent last month. Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, rose 0.6 percent to $ 2.57 trillion last month following a 1.1 percent gain in January. On the spending side, most of the modest gain came in a 1 percent rise in spending for services, which analysts said was largely a reflection of an upturn in heating bills last month after January's mild weather. Purchases of non-durable goods edged up 0.1 percent and spending on durable goods declined 0.3 percent. The decline in durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years _ primarily was due to lackluster car sales, which have been held back by higher interest rates and reduced demand after earlier strong sales. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the School of Business and Management at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the slower gain in spending `` should be interpreted as a return to normal spending behavior'' from earlier, unsustainably high levels fueled by strong employment. Analysts said the rise in the savings rate reflected the big drop in auto sales and recent increases in farm income because farmers generally do n't alter their spending patterns based on when they receive income and subsidies. Farm income, subject to wide swings, was up 32 percent in February after shooting up 103 percent in January. Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said the savings rate also might be going up in part because consumers are retrenching somewhat as they become `` a little bit more concerned'' about the possibility of an economic downturn. Consumers are more likely to feel the pinch of higher interest rates this year as their adjustable-rate mortgages rachet upward and slower income growth fails to ease the bite of other higher financing costs, she said.

 A 50-foot boat carrying about 100 Haitians was intercepted Friday just outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territorial waters, and the refugees will be returned to their homeland, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reported. Officers determined that the Haitians' wooden sailboat was intercepted 3.2 miles from shore, just outside the 3-mile limit, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. `` Real close,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. `` They did two readings and confirmed that is the correct position _ perhaps they were just a breath away from making it into the three miles.'' If the Haitians had been inside the limit, they would have been brought ashore for detention and processing, and their claims for asylum would have been considered by <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said the Haitians were spotted early Friday by the crew of a tanker about three miles east of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. Medical personnel were sent to the sailboat as a precaution and the unsuccessful immigrants also were given water, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. Two of the would-be immigrants were taken to Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` They're suffering from exposure and dehydrated,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> said late Friday afternoon, adding it was too soon to say if they would be admitted. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter was dispatched to return the Haitians to their homeland. Leaders of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Haitian community, meanwhile, attacked what they call a racist immigration policy. While Cubans and Nicaraguans are received with open arms, they say, Haitians are n't even allowed into the country. `` It's clear they're playing games with the black refugees,'' said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Haitian Refugee Center. `` We would like to see something done about it.'' An <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> official denied there was any discrimination in the interdiction policy. `` It's just that more Haitians are coming in boats than any other ethnic group,'' said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. `` There's nothing really one can do.''

 Anti-abortion protesters were arrested by the busload at demonstrations in several cities as the group <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> kicked its Holy Week campaign into high gear on Good Friday. Arrests numbered in the triple digits in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, as demonstrators chanted, prayed, picketed and blocked entrances at women's clinics Friday. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, had more peaceful protests. <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based Operation Rescue has organized periodic demonstrations of civil disobedience to publicize its stance against abortion, and Holy Week has been a traditional time for anti-abortion protests. Abortion rights groups used the anticipated demonstrations to organize counterprotests in several cities. In <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, site of the largest demonstration, about 350 abortion foes blocked doorways at a downtown medical office as some 300 abortion rights advocates chanted, `` Read'em their rights and take them away.'' However, Police Chief <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Binkley </PERSON> refused to make arrests, saying the building was closed. It was not immediately clear whether the protesters, who had arrived about 6:30 a.m., had kept the office from opening or whether the facility was scheduled to be closed Friday. Operation Rescue's leader, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, arrived on the scene as the protest was well under way and declared, `` What a riot.'' He repeated his claim that the news media is `` hiding the truth from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public.'' One anti-abortion activist was charged with misdemeanor battery for allegedly throwing himself onto three pro-choice activists sitting on the ground in front of another clinic, said Sgt. Bill Snow. About 1:45 p.m., a man called the administrative offices of Planned Parenthood and `` said there's a bomb in the building and it's going to blow up any minute,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, director of clinical programs. About 30 people evacuated the building but police found no bomb and the workers returned an hour later, said Dr. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbott </PERSON>, executive director. A day earlier 373 protesters had been hauled off by police in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of Cypress. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 400 to 500 demonstrators on both sides of the abortion issue gathered in rain and gusting winds outside two downtown clinics a block apart. About 180 people _ more than four busloads _ were carted off by police for blocking entrances at the Planned Parenthood clinic and the <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for Women. <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCook </PERSON>, a worker at Planned Parenthood, said abortion rights advocates were staging a counterdemonstration because `` people are afraid they're going to lose their rights.'' In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, some 200 protesters carried banners and signs that read, `` Abortion, The Ultimate Child Abuse,'' `` Baby Humans Slaughtered Here'' and `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> Would be Proud of Planned Parenthood,'' shortly after dawn at the downtown office of Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood. About 115 protesters were arrested for blocking the clinic's doors or standing on clinic property They went limp, forcing police to drag them into waiting vans and a converted passenger bus. `` We're trying to save babies,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Roman Catholic Archdiocese, as he was carted away. He said he'd been arrested five times before at similar protests. The demonstrators refused to say whether they were part of Operation Rescue, but some sported `` O.R.'' armbands and Operation Rescue sweatshirts. By afternoon, a pro-choice advocates had begun a counterdemonstration across the street. In <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, police used wheelchairs to haul away as many as 50 protesters who entered the Planned Parenthood Center while about 100 others picketed outside in a cold drizzle. `` They barged in and shoved at least one staff worker aside,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON>, the clinic's community relations director. `` I do n't think they pushed any patients, but they certainly verbally harangued and harassed them.'' In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, about 150 anti-abortion protesters, some carrying large crosses, chanted and prayed outside <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul-Ramsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in their traditional Good Friday protest. Police reported no arrests. About three dozen protesters from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> blocked doors at the Dayton Women's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Kettering </LOCATION>. About 30 were handcuffed and put onto a police bus as the few remaining demonstrators cheered. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Keck </PERSON>, a protester, said the group came to <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> police were waiting for them. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, 30 to 35 demonstrators picketed two women's clinics but no on was arrested.

 A popular high school teacher and class adviser was killed Friday by a gunman with a semiautomatic weapon who shot him three times in the back as he left for school, police said.

The killer, who fired six shots from a .22 - caliber semiautomatic gun, apparently was either standing in the street or sitting in a car in front of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s home in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, the lieutenant said at an afternoon news The teacher's wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and one of his two sons ran outside to find him on the ground, and he was pronounced dead a short time later at <ORGANIZATION> Sherman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>.

Robbery was tentatively ruled out as a motive. `` He simply walked out, started to get into his car and was shot from behind,'' <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said. `` No one approached him to take anything from him.'' A 16 - or 17-year-old boy who had been expelled from <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was being sought at his home and at his new school, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> High </LOCATION>, where he has n't been seen since Tuesday `` Some of the students we talked to indicated it would be worth our while to talk to him.

 A drug addict who cut a bloody path through a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb with a submachine gun heated up debate over semiautomatic weapons Friday in a state where residents jealously guard their firearms and their freedom. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said she intends to introduce a resolution Monday declaring the council's intention to pass a law restricting or prohibiting the sale of such weapons. `` They're weapons of war, even if it's only a small war, like we saw yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who expects strong opposition to the measure. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, described by authorities as a 20-year-old man with an insatiable appetite for cocaine, killed two women with a semiautomatic machine pistol, raped another woman, and wounded two deputies and a hostage before fatally wounding himself in a 10-hour reign of terror Thursday. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> used a semiautomatic MAC-11 submachine gun, which can hold 32 bullets. Only five bullets were left when the manhunt for him ended. Last week, following a trend of nationwide outrage over semiautomatic weapons, state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> sponsored a bill that would ban the sale, transfer and receipt of semiautomatic assault rifles. The Republican legislator said Thursday's tragedy would stir emotions on both sides, but he does n't expect the measure to be very popular among <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s residents, who tend to love their firearms and their freedom. `` There will be an awful lot of heat generated, not much light and very few minds changed,'' he said. Authorities said Friday that the gunman, a drug addict with a long criminal record, used a gun stolen during a March 19 burglary. Investigators said they also had arrested a suspected accomplice, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, on charges of taking part in 71 burglaries with <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> was being questioned Friday to learn whether <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had said anything prior to his rampage, according to Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had been a suspect in at least 140 thefts and burglaries, and had been sought on arrest warrants issued Monday for failure to appear in Golden District Court for probation revocation, authorities said. His 18-year-old hostage, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>, remained in critical but stable condition Friday following surgery at Swedish Medical Center, officials said. <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 36, and Deputy <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, 37, were released from Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after being treated for gunshot wounds and shrapnel wounds from flying glass. In addition to <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the dead included <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, 68. Autopsies Friday showed that <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> was shot in the head and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> was shot in the head, chest and ankle after they were bound with rope. Shots were also fired at <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, the husband of <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, but he played dead and survived, authorities said. <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who took part in a dramatic rescue of two of his wounded deputies by driving his car through a fence, held up the MAC-11 after the shootings and demanded that such `` weapons of war'' be regulated or banned. For comparison, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> also held up the bloody .38 - caliber revolver used by one of his wounded `` Our officers are out-gunned. ... These guns are designed to kill and maim people,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who had come out against semiautomatic weapon sales before the rampage. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> already has approved a ban on 40 types of assault-type weapons, and similar action is pending in other states. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> took the action after a man with an AK-47 assault rifle killed five schoolchildren and wounded 29 others along with a teacher.

 A federal order Friday that could sink a $ 500 million proposed dam and reservoir drew angry charges of interference from some <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials, but environmentalists praised it as wise and courageous. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, themain sponsors of the Two Forks Dam, were dismayed after hearing of the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. `` We feel Mr. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> has interjected himself in this process outside the purview of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s own regulations,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON> said the project `` addressed environmental and other concerns and has emerged far and away as the biggest long-term water supply plan for the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> metropolitan area.'' The eight-year-old project on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has been the center of a bitter fight between environmentalists and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area officials who say the region needs the dam for its future water needs. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> began procedures tantamount to overruling a construction permit issued earlier this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, which could lead to a veto of the project if compromises are not worked out. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s position a `` basic disagreement between federal agencies about how the decision should be made.'' `` That disagreement is fertile ground for delay and indecision,'' the governor said. He said he would prefer to see a permit for Two Forks issued with `` a 25-year shelf life,'' and added he would be willing to take action to compensate for damage to the environment and wildlife. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said `` the impact of a final rejection of Two Forks, in my opinion, will have stronger environmental consequences. That is the message not communicated to the EPA office.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> and environmentalist organizations, however, praised <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s action. `` I think we should view <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision as a commitment by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to conserving one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most beautiful canyons and conserving water resources,'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said. `` But today's decision does not mean that we should stop looking for ways to provide more water for metropolitan <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>,'' he added. Dr. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said, `` I commend -LRB- the -RRB- EPA administrator for a courageous position. ... It is economically a bad project and environmentally, it's been a disaster.'' <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> said the decision was the first major environmental test for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and he passed it `` with flying colors.''

 Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s Socialist government suffered a double blow Thursday when two of its most prominent figures were accused of direct involvement in a massive financial scandal. <PERSON> Yiannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON>, former secretary to the Cabinet, told an investigating magistrate that fugitive banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> had bribed a former minister to the premier, <PERSON> Agamemnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON>, to help cover up financial wrongdoings at his bank. <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON> was an associate of <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>. In another development, <PERSON> Theofanis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobras </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>'s general manager, was jailed after testifying before another magistrate investigating the <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> affair. <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s for 25 years, has strongly denied any involvement in the scandal. No judicial action has been taken against him so far. He resigned his post last week. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, fled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> November 6 after being indicted in the $ 200 million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal. He was arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is awaiting an extradition hearing. In interviews from jail in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> claimed that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, Koutsogiorgas and other officials received millions of dollars in payoffs and authorized the bank fraud. <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON>, who was the banker's lawyer, was arrested March 9 and charged with accepting stolen money from <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON> made the accusations during a second day of testimony before <PERSON> Giorgos </PERSON> <PERSON> Skarlatos </PERSON>, the magistrate investigating the scandal. `` The course of the investigation has shown that Koutsogiorgas bears responsibilities for this crime,'' <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Filipos </PERSON> <PERSON> Damoflis </PERSON>, told reporters after his client testifed for 10 hours. He added that the judicial investigation should be finished and sent to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for examination. Under the Greek Constitution, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is the only body that can appoint a special judicial panel to investigate wrongdoings perpetrated by acting or former ministers. The scandal has prompted both Conservative and Communist opposition parties to call for <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s resignation. In his written testimony, leaked to the press, <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON> said he arranged to deposit $ 2 million in a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank as payment to Koutsogiorgas for a special secrecy act that stifled an audit of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> in July 1988. `` I opened an account ... in three names. Mine, Mr. <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON>' and in the name of his son <PERSON> Dimitris </PERSON> <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON>,'' said the testimony, which included the purported bank account number. <PERSON> Tobras </PERSON> was charged with breach of faith for depositing $ 12.5 million in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> last summer. He became the fourth manager of a public corporation to be jailed for depositing large amounts of money in the bank at lower than normal interest rates when it was suffering from a cash-flow problem. Among the corporations are <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and the post office. Tobras, a Socialist, has in the past been charged with tapping the telephones of opposition parties and using firearms to harrass journalists. He has not yet been tried on the charges.

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday rejected a triple murderer's plea for a stay of his execution by injection or hanging. The high court said the motion for a stay, based mostly on <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s absence during jury selection for his 1982 murder trial, was not worthy of further consideration. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gombiner </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> had signed a waiver of his right be present at jury selection, but argued that `` by court rule a defendant in a capital case can never waive his right to be present at jury selection.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. next Thursday for the 1982 knife slayings of <PERSON> Renae </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicklund </PERSON>, 31, her 8-year-old daughter <PERSON> Shannah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, 51. In a neatly printed brief submitted to the court Wednesday, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> also asserted that `` death by hanging is so psychologically distressing and frightening to petitioner that the fear of being hung will force petitioner to violate his religious beliefs against killing and suicide, ... forcing petitioner to actively take part in his own demise in order to escape death by hanging.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s lead lawyer <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON> said late Thursday he will seek a stay of execution from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> within the next few days, seeking a stay of execution. At the time of the murders, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> was living at a work release center, serving a sentence for assault and sodomy. Ms. <PERSON> Wicklund </PERSON> was the victim in those crimes and testified against <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> at the earlier trial.

 A South Korean company has seized a Japanese machinery company president for the second time in four months in a business dispute, and his whereabouts are unknown, his company said Thursday. <PERSON> Koji </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohno </PERSON> of the Japanese company <ORGANIZATION> Osawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seisakusho </ORGANIZATION> said the firm has received 12 telephone facsimile messages from <ORGANIZATION> Namil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> requesting $ 3.8 million. He said recent messages declared that <ORGANIZATION> Osawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Tokuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Osawa </PERSON> had been beaten, and that one of his fingers would be cut off and sent to back up demands for payment. The messages also threatened <PERSON> Osawa </PERSON>'s family, <PERSON> Kohno </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has asked South Korean authorities to cooperate in the case, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said. While it was up to the two companies to settle their business dispute, he said, `` this kind of illegal action should not accompany a solution of the case.'' <ORGANIZATION> Osawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> exported six press machines to <LOCATION> Namil </LOCATION> last year for about $ 837,000, and <PERSON> Osawa </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in December to offer technial assistance after <PERSON> Namil </PERSON> complained that the machines were defective, <PERSON> Kohno </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers Thursday he would work to keep international trade open but `` will not confuse involvement with interference.'' Speaking to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised industry's recent gains in productivity and exporting. `` Nobody is second-guessing American manufacturing any more. Clearly you all are playing a winning game,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was applauded vigorously when he said he would `` keep on fighting'' for his proposal to reduce the capital-gains tax rate to a maximum of 15 percent, about half the current top rate. The proposal, part of his fiscal 1990 budget package, has been cooly received by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The president contends that lowering the tax on capital gains _ proceeds from the sale of stock, homes, buildings, real-estate and other assets _ would spur new business investment and bring as much as $ 4.8 billion in new tax revenue to the government for 1990. `` This is a case where less means more,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said a lower capital-gains rate would enhance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness abroad. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the manufacturers, `` Your presence here today demonstrates that you are fighting to win the international struggle for continued growth.'' `` I'm not saying you're going to have to do it alone,'' he added. `` There is a role for government. Sometimes political leadership is needed _ for example to keep international trade free and fair. However, I will tell you that this government will not confuse involvement with interference.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sounded again the anti-drug theme he has been stressing in recent speeches, saying drug and alchohol abuse are cutting into business productivity. `` We're determined to keep drugs out of the workplace,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He praised a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on drug-testing, saying it would give his administration's anti-drug efforts `` a much better chance of success.'' The court on Tuesday upheld the constitutionality of drug testing programs for law enforcement and public safety workers. `` Employers can teach their people to recognize the signs of substance abuse in their co-workers _ and understand how drug abuse hurts the non-users on the line,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Later in the day, the president went for a two-mile jog under chilly, gray skies at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McNair </LOCATION>, inviting two reporters and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to join him and a few aides for the 20-minute run. Still later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> went by motorcade to a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant in nearby <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where they dined with press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s finance. After the meal, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked around the restaurant shaking hands with other diners and the entire restaurant erupted in applause.

 After sitting silently in a courtroom where he is on trial on 12 Iran-Contra charges, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> returned to the lecture circuit Thursday to tell a conservative audience that he is `` still very wary'' of the reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I may be a lonely voice, but I will urge all of you to watch very closely what Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> does,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> told a dinner audience at a conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. North, who is charged with lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his alleged fund-raising for Nicaraguan Contras at a time support for the rebel forces had been outlawed, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` is continuing to arm <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to the point where <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could well be forced in the future to move forces from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere around the world to defend our own southern border.'' In his trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, <PERSON> North </PERSON> has mostly sat silently and listened as witnesses give varying portrayals of his conduct as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. In his speech, he said he found himself `` out of work and in this new venue, given a chance to speak without a subpoena.'' He said in the past eight years `` freedom fighter movements ... truly have raised up new aspirations for the freedom of millions'' in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and elsewhere. As for Soviet reforms, he said, `` There has been no reduction, but rather an increase in support for radical communist regimes like that in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' `` Despite the vast publicity, I must tell you that I personally am still very wary,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` Today, inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> it is in vogue to criticize former dictators, but not the current dictator.'' Earlier, black veterans of the civil rights movement, describing themselves as conservatives, criticized news coverage of racial issues, portraying the media as distractive or even hostile. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, who in 1961 was the first black student to enroll in the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` A very small band of conspirators bent on dominating world affairs have maneuvered and swayed all the media in the Western Christian world.'' `` This group, which I will refer to as the liberal elite, has determined that the subjugation of the black race is critical to the success of its scheme to control the world,'' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Innis </PERSON>, a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The media has exhibited a schizoid and dichotomous behavior on race relations in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and also in the rest of the world.'' `` On one hand that behavior has at times in terms of race relations has been beneficial, but at most times, in particular at this time, it has been invidious,'' he said. <PERSON> Innis </PERSON> praised aspects of media coverage of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, saying, `` Without the media friendly I do n't think much of the gains we made could have been made. At the same time, he said, the media depicted whites in the South as `` bad guys'' and those in the <PERSON> North </PERSON> as `` good guys'' and ignored `` the decency and commmitment for change that was being expressed by many white Southerners in order to project this simplistic vision of good guy, bad guy.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, identified as a a founding member of the Student Non-violent <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told the group, `` The media and the civil rights movement and its leaders and organizations are in fact allies ... in a war and that is the war ... to detract the people from fundamental issues of justice, common sense and political reality.'' `` Now I am not going to attribute all of these sinister motives to a cabal of media professionals and civil rights leaders,'' he said. `` It's just a crazy coincidence of timing that goes back many, many years.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevell </PERSON>, a former strategist for the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, however, suggested that unfavorable images of some black political leaders in the news media are the fault of the blacks and not the media. Responding to a question about coverage of <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and other black political figures, <PERSON> Bevell </PERSON> said, `` There is not an elected black official in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today that has constitutional consciousness.'' `` ` The media is not attacking black people,'' he said. `` The black guys are not qualified, and will not say to the white guys who know constitutional principles, ` I would like to serve as an apprentice' ... and so they play like they know government.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nettles </PERSON>, national vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, was moderator of the panel.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will give up command of the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in May, a change the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> called routine and unrelated to the possible terrorist bombing of a van driven by <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' wife. `` This has been in the works for a long time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> became captain of the guided missile cruiser in April 1987, and a command usually runs about two years, <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether the March 10 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' van was in retaliation for the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' mistaken destruction of an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last July. All 290 aboard the plane were killed. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> has been in protected seclusion since the attack, which left her uninjured. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was in command when the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> left last week on a training mission off <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

He said he did n't know what <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' next duty assignment would be. However, The -LRB- <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, citing an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> source, said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> would take command of a shore installation in the <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> is eligibile for promotion to rear admiral, the source said. Meanwhile, it was reported that Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who lost her teaching job at La Jolla Country Day school after the bombing, has written parents of her former pupils to say she was n't a security risk. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jolla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> announced last week that she was leaving her teaching job by mutual consent to ensure the safety of the school's students. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who says she was fired by the school, stated in her letter that an in-depth investigation by federal officials found that `` no evidence exists of a direct or implied threat against me or the school,'' the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. That finding, Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> wrote, left her `` prepared to resume a full classroom schedule'' until administrators notified her last Thursday `` that my services had been terminated.'' One school official told the Times that Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was not allowed to return to her fourth-grade classroom partly because administrators feared parents would pull their children out of the exclusive private school if she remained on the faculty. School spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> again maintained that Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was not fired. `` We're just not renewing her contract,'' he said Wednesday. `` No matter what kind of furor she expresses, she's not coming back.

 Grocer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s longtime battle against drug trafficking in his neighborhood provoked vandalism against his business and home, physical attacks, and finally, authorities suspect, his slaying. Homicide detectives have been working round-the-clock since <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> of <PERSON> West </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrine </PERSON> was killed Monday in a spray of up to 30 bullets in front of his grocery store, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Grocery. `` He was a fine man,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, a staff member of <PERSON> Perrine </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which had Lawrence on its board. `` The lack of his leadership will be felt for a long time,'' she said. `` The entire community is in a state of shock.'' Late last week, three days before the Monday killing, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, ministers and other concerned citizens to discuss how to squelch the rampant drug problem in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perrine </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` You do n't know how bad I feel,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` They were going to assist us by identifying some of the individuals. We just ca n't live in this kind of society.'' Detectives Thursday were still looking for two men in their mid-20s, but had made no arrests. They have yet to establish a motive, but they believe <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> was slain by professional killers. His family and neighbors, however, said they think the murder was arranged by drug dealers. Last week, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> filed a complaint with police about a death threat. A friend had told <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> that a drug dealer was threatening to kill him. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said a detective was investigating the threat, and officers were told to patrol the store. `` We ca n't assign a policeman around the clock to stay with somebody unless we have some specifics,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know what we could have done. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 51, was widely known in the neighborhood for his anti-drug stance, visiting schools and organizing residents to fight against dealers. Two years ago, shots were fired into his home and homemade bombs were tossed into his store. He also was the target of two attacks in which gunmen fired on him as he entered his house. No one was arrested, but police say they suspected drug dealers. The night <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> died, two men in military camouflage clothes were lurking around <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Grocery, said <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a witness in the parking lot. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Nita </PERSON>, said her father cooperated with police, letting them know about suspicious activity, and she talked of how he stood up to the area's drug dealers. `` He let them know they were n't welcome,'' she said.

 A film produced by former Beatle <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> is making its debut nearly two decades after it captured <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>'s counter-culture during a huge 1971 rally to support a jailed activist Screenings of the film `` Ten for Two,'' have been held up by <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s own reluctance to release it during his lifetime and by uncertainty over who owns the rights. The movie documents a benefit concert held at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Crisler </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, a radical activist who was serving a 10-year prison sentence for possession of two marijuana cigarettes. He was released shortly after the December 1971 concert, having served 2 -LCB- years. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, who faced his own problems with drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, apparently was unwilling to release the film that features radical speakers, folk protest songwriters and fellow rock musicians such as <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>. `` This film was not released because of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s immigration problems,'' the film's director, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, said. `` The immigration people said if you let this out, -LRB- <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> -RRB- might as well book a boat home.'' Ownership rights of the film, which runs about 80 minutes, still have n't been settled, but it will be shown anyway April 1 in <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb, and April 2 in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there's anything in writing anywhere'' about the rights, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> of MediaVision, a non-profit film company based in <LOCATION> Hazel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> that's putting on the two showings. He said there are no current plans for other showings. The film apparently has been seen only rarely, at a handful of private parties and a brief showing in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, perform three songs in the film, including one composition <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> dedicated to <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> and one song <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said she wrote `` for the women of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> played an acoustic guitar and <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> played a drum. Others appearing in the film are radicals <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, as well as Wonder, <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, folksinger <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochs </PERSON> and the rock group Commander <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> and His Lost Planet Airmen. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> has not responded to queries about the film. `` This is one of the ways to see if she'll cooperate positively to get it -LRB- the film -RRB- into public hands,'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, who now edits the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>'s `` City Arts Quarterly,'' said after seeing the film Wednesday that it depressed him. `` The people you see in this movie are responsible for all the changes we had during the 1960s and'70s,'' he said. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> died in 1980, shot to death near his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home by a deranged admirer. At the time of <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s arrest, possession of marijuana was a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He was arrested at age 25 in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> while living as a poet and revolutionary who founded the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>. He received the maximum sentence. Lobbying efforts to free <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> eventually paid off, even before the concert was held. The day before the concert, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> voted to reduce the penalty for possession of small amounts of marijuana to a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison. Because he already had served 2 -LCB- years, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> was released from prison three days after the concert.

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s justice minister on Thursday shrugged off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges against leaders of the infamous <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, saying the country faced a much bigger crisis than pursuing reputed cocaine kingpins. `` For the American government, drug trafficking is the biggest problem,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Plazas </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcid </PERSON>. `` For us, it is one of many, including terrorism and subversion.'' Thirty people, including reputed cartel leaders, were indicted in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> on Wednesday, accused of smuggling $ 1 billion in cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and other points. Plazas, who had no visible security guards, told a luncheon gathering of 130 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation was doing its best to confront the drug issue, but extraditing cartel leaders for prosecution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not an option. The extradition treaty between the two countries was invalidated by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s supreme court after the capture of cartel co-leader <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, convicted last year and sentenced to life in prison for cocaine trafficking to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since then, the extradition issue has been on hold. Asked what effect Wednesday's sweeping drug-trafficking indictment might have, Plazas simply replied, `` the extradition treaty ca n't be applied.'' Among those indicted was <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, an alleged leader of the cartel accused of plotting the assassination of Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> in 1984 and the 1986 slaying of drug informant <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON>. Plazas discussed for nearly an hour the reform and strengthening of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s judicial system in response to drug trafficking, guerrilla activity, common delinquency and the weakening of the public and private sectors. `` If we are not at the edge of the abyss, then we're getting to the point of almost no return,'' Plazas said. `` This is like a gigantic nuclear mushroom cloud penetrating the whole society.'' Plazas said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, as a producing nation, should not bear sole reponsibility for the drug problem and insisted it was a worldwide issue that needed to be addressed on that scale. `` <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is not responsible for drug trafficking _ it is a victim,'' he said. `` We are all victims.'' He referred to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s swift reaction to tainted Chilean fruit, saying this country had the power to respond with equal vigor to drug trafficking. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors said they were confident many of the 30 defendants named in the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> indictment would eventually face prosecution. In addition to <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, the indictment _ charging bribery, murder and conspiracy to import 44,000 pounds of cocaine _ named alleged cartel leaders <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> and brothers <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>. Also indicted was <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, an associate of <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, who was charged with receiving bribes to protect cartel smuggling operations in the island nation. The Bahamian government Thursday issued a statement strongly denying <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> was in any way linked to drug traffickers. `` The legal difficulties -LRB- of -RRB- ... <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, a private Bahamian citizen, have nothing to do with the government of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, its institutions or its people,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Others indicted in the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> case were alleged pilots, managers of cocaine operations and distributors of the drug.

<TEXT>
 A federal court extended a ban Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell nearly 1 billion board feet of ancient timber from nine national forests in two states where the northern spotted owl lives. Environmentalists hailed the ruling, but a timber industry lawyer said it could mean the loss of 11,000 to 14,000 jobs in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> also set a trial for June 13 on challenges by the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loggers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to the agency's spotted owl management plans. Wildlife biologists are still trying to determine whether the owl, which is believed to inhabit only ancient forests, is really threatened with extinction. Roughly 2,400 owls are thought to inhabit the woods of the Northwest. `` It's obvious that once the habitat is destroyed, it can not be replaced in any time frame that our generation can deal with,'' <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said. `` That, of course, demonstrates a form of irreparable harm.'' If timber interests prevail at trial, `` the trees in question have been growing for hundreds of years, and they will still be available for logging,'' he added. But he said the prospects that the environmentalists would prevail were `` sufficiently strong'' to justify a preliminary injunction, in effect extending by 60 days a temporary restraining order he issued Friday. `` Today's injunction is not just a victory for the ancient forest-dependent spotted owl but is also important to the increasing number of people in the recreation, tourism, retirement and fishing industries whose future livelihood is tied in large part to the ancient forests' protection,'' said <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutzick </PERSON>, a lawyer for the loggers, said the 60-day injunction against sales would mean a one-year delay in actually logging the more than 18,000 affected acres of spotted owl habitat, roughly 29 square miles. The more than 900,000 board feet of timber to be logged from those areas amounted to a one-year supply of logs for 20 to 30 mills, <PERSON> Rutzick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rutzick </PERSON> said that, because of the ruling, `` I think it is very possible that 20 domestic sawmills in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> ... will close within the next 12 months.'' He said that would idle 3,000 to to 4,000 mill workers and 8,000 to 10,000 others in timber-dependent work ranging from shopkeepers to gasoline station attendants.

 Fresh Chilean grapes are being trucked across the country today after a two-week absence from store shelves because of a cyanide poisoning scare, industry leaders say.

 From street vendors in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, you can buy: _ For $ 6, an expertly stitched, longsleeved cotton shirt bearing the polo rider logo of designer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>. _ For $ 1, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s recent `` Giving You the Best I Got'' album on an audio cassette. _ For $ 8, a <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> movie on video cassette _ titles ranging from `` Casablanca'' to `` Rain Man.'' _ For $ 33, the latest computer software, such as the popular DBase IV program. Total bill for one of each: $ 48; in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: as much as $ 783. The items in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would be genuine. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, they're counterfeits, the result of wholesale piracy of foreign intellectual property, including patents, copyrights and trademarks <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is by no means alone. Outright counterfeits and various shades of imitations are churned out in many countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, depriving creators and legitimate businesses of what the Geneva-based World Economic Form estimates is $ 70 billion a year. But <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> lately has been in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s unwanted spotlight because other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> governments are more effectively cracking down on counterfeiters in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and West European countries are also unhappy about violations of intellectual property rights, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has taken the toughest action. In January the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government began to deny duty free benefits on about $ 165 million worth of Thai imports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> faces further, more serious penalties under provisions of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Act if improvements are n't forthcoming. The issue is economically important to both countries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s most important export market; the Thais last year had a $ 1.4 billion trade surplus on exports worth $ 3.4 billion to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Serious retaliatory measures by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> could hurt the vibrant <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> economy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in turn is trying to cope with massive trade deficits; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say billions of revenue dollars are lost yearly to the piracy of American intellectual property worldwide. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in turbulent economic times and forced to take stronger stands on economic issues. That surprises allies like <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` Some Thais understand this but others see it as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> bullying an old friend.'' Both sides generally agree that with the exception of pharmaceutical products and computer software, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> laws now offer considerable protection. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and businessmen charge that enforcement of these laws is poor and penalties for violations are minimal. For example, one shopowner found guilty of selling wallets and luggage labeled as <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuitton </PERSON> in January was fined $ 40. On <LOCATION> Silom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, the main business thoroughfare, products of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s low wage, highly skilled pirates are on open display in sidewalk stalls. The merchandise includes often superb imitations of <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> handbags, <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> jeans and children's clothing adorned with <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> and other trademark cartoon characters. A handsomely faked Rolex watch, the `` Submariner'' model, sells for about $ 35 as compared to more than $ 1,200 for a genuine model. The issue has sparked debate in Parliament and the press with opponents of protection arguing that countries such as <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> can ill afford to pay standard world market prices for such vital tools for development as computer software, medicine and textbooks. The extreme anti-protection view was mirrored in a newspaper article attributed to a university professor who otherwise was left unidentified: `` <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON> did not care what would happen to their works and did not guard them covetously and selfishly. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> did not sell his apple theory.'' But other Thais are concerned about piracy. `` I think the fact that we are joining the -LRB- economic -RRB- big leagues means we have to pay more attention to intellectual property rights,'' <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Surin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitsuwan </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Protection contributes to a safe and secure atmosphere for investment, research and technology transfer.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> noted that big, legitimate Thai businesses recently have begun to speak up for protection, indicating they do n't want <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s booming export trade battered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation for the sake of a few counterfeiters. <PERSON> Surin </PERSON> stressed the need for an information campaign to get the public to understand the long-term benefits of offering protection to intellectual property. `` But it's difficult when the market forces are so strong,'' he said. `` How can we stop it easily when the first thing visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen do after the formal agenda is to go out and buy as many alligator-label shirts as they can get?''

 From <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, throngs of agitated people have besieged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies and consulates in recent weeks _ not in anger, but in eagerness. People anxious to gain information about a new program that will grant 20,000 immigrant visas into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1991 and 1992 have kept embassy telephones ringing off the hook and snarled embassy entry ways. _ In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, the embassy was forced to shut down its entire complex and call the local police recently to deal with a crowd of 2,000 people demanding details. _ In <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, people began forming lines at 6 a.m., and police finally organized the crowds into groups of 20 persons for entry into the embassy. The rush was touched off late last month when the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that citizens from 162 countries will be eligible for the special visa lottery. Some 20,000 entrants will be chosen at random by computer, and applicants only have until Friday to apply. Normally, immigrants have to prove they have a close relative in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or a scarce profession in order to enter the country, said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consular Affairs office The enthusiastic response is understandable, she says, because `` suddenly, there's an opportunity for anyone to come'' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ but only if they meet the other basic requirements as well, such as good health and no criminal contacts. The last lottery, a more restrictive program in 1986, brought 10,000 people into the country; 1.4 million applicants lost out. Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the prime sponsor of the law that established the program, said it was designed to `` encourage diversity'' in the nation's immigration program `` and to give opportunity to those who have no family contacts to come to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Immigration is good for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It is a tremendous source of economic innovation and growth,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. It appears there will be no problem attracting applicants. Within hours of the announcement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> posts abroad were nearly under siege. `` The Marine on -LRB- weekend -RRB- duty in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION> was among the first to feel the enthusiastic response _ he spent his shift informing callers they'd have to wait until Monday morning for information,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the Malaysian embassy reported. In the first week, the embassy handed out more than 3,000 information sheets about the program and handled more than 1,000 phone calls. In desperation, the embassy installed a five-minute telephone recording with information that logged about 100 calls a day. Elsewhere around the world, Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said embassies reported similar situations: In <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, a special telephone hotline was set up, and the telephone `` has never stopped ringing,'' the embassy reported. In <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, embassy officials put information on bulletin boards so people waiting in lines could obtain background about the program. But that did n't stop others from waiting in long lines, trying to get help with their applications. In <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, the post handed out 5,000 information sheets in three days. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the switchboard operator fielded `` thousands of calls'' in the days after the program was announced. In <LOCATION> Dacca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, the embassy reported interest from `` all segments of society _ from university professors to rickshaw drivers,'' along with heavy demand for information. But the fact that no application form was available appeared to confuse some, as well as the request that the information required, such as name, residence and address, be typed `` in the Roman alphabet'' on a sheet of paper. `` More than one application arrived using Roman numerals,'' the embassy reported. The embassy in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, reported an `` extraordinary response'' that `` increased the workload of an already hard-pressed'' consular unit. From the embassy in <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, officials reported being `` besieged'' with telephone calls, requests for information and letters. More than 1,000 information sheets were handed out. `` Tongans, Rotumans, Vanuatuans and others in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> are eager to participate,'' in the program, the embassy reported. <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> are independent nations, while <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON> is an island grouping that is part of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>. In contrast, however, the residents of northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> seem uninterested in moving to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The post in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> said the announcement did not attract media attention `` or evoke any great public interest.'' And even though some 162 requests came to the post in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, `` no inquiries'' were received in the first weeks of the program in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> reported.

 Some doctors have taken on a new partner: a quest for profit that influences the way they treat their patients. Among those criticized for an overriding emphasis on the financial bottom line are some of the walk-in clinics that have sprouted around the nation, offering treatment at any hour without an appointment and earning revenues in the billions of dollars. In this first article in a continuing series, `` The Business of Medicine,'' Science Writer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> and National Writer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayles </PERSON> look at allegations that these clinics sometimes do unnecessary tests to pile up profits.

 Each month, doctors at many of the nation's 4,000 walk-in clinics receive report cards from their employers. Instead of rating the quality of their care, these printouts rank the size of their bills. To some health experts and doctors in the $ 2.5-billion-a-year walk-in industry, these `` productivity sheets'' are just one example of the lures and prods used by many storefront clinics to raise profits through unnecessary charges. Doctors complain they are enticed with bonuses, inspired with pep talks, chastened with reprimands and even threatened with dismissal, all to keep them churning out lucrative but questionable X-rays, tests and prescriptions to raise patients' bills. `` You could see people walk in with a simple head cold. The doctors would order a chest X-ray, sinus X-ray, a few lab tests, and pretty soon you've turned a head cold into a $ 150 extravaganza,'' recalled Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruzzese </PERSON> of his days at a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> clinic. Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herold </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, who resigned from a walk-in chain, explained how some doctors try to justify extraneous tests: `` If you can order a battery of tests and do X-rays, patients think they've gotten good medicine _ and you've made more money off of them. Some say the often-anonymous brand of medicine practiced by the so-called `` doc-in-the-box'' clinics _ no-appointment-needed, no-medical-history-known _ leads to overuse of testing to reassure patients and protect doctors from malpractice claims. `` You do n't get sued for taking an X-ray. You get sued for not taking it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a partner in four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> walk-in clinics. Clinic executives deny they encourage needless tests. One study backs them up, though a medical authority says the survey did n't check the right tests Over the past decade walk-in clinics, mostly owned by individual doctors, small local chains or hospitals, have sprung up on Main Streets and in shopping malls across the country. Open at night and on weekends, they recorded 50 million patient visits last year, earning an estimated $ 2.5 billion. `` We have all heard anecdotal stories about clinics that put the dollar sign ahead of the patient,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Ring, chairman of the board of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's very definitely unethical to order or charge for a test or procedure that the physician knows is unnecessary.'' Clinic officials say productivity sheets and other inducements simply remind payroll doctors that medicine is a business as well as a profession. `` People find it hard to believe that doctors work on a percentage, but that's the way it works in the emergency room and private practices,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, owner of the Doctor's Walk-In Clinic chain in the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, area Many doctors like walk-in medicine because they can practice the way they want. They side with Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Iser </PERSON>, who works at a <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, branch of Health Stop, the nation's biggest chain with 112 clinics in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` I've never felt any pressure by the company to order tests that would be considered medically unnecessary,'' <PERSON> Iser </PERSON> said. Nonetheless, internal documents from Health Stop demonstrate the company's emphasis on testing levels. One memo from the director of operations asked nurses to help prevent `` underutilization of ancillaries,'' meaning diagnostic procedures. It said they should `` obtain ... the necessary lab and X-ray tests'' before the doctors see the patients. Doctors reluctant to allow this were to be reported. Another memo, which began by noting that average revenue per patient had dropped, urged nursing supervisors to keep patient waiting time to a minimum, to give patients followup appointments and to be `` more aggressive'' assisting doctors with billings. `` Offer suggestions regarding routine medical protocols for lab and X-ray utilization at Health Stop,'' it said. Health Stop doctors are paid about $ 35 an hour or 21 percent of their gross charges, whichever is higher. Many clinics offer doctors a percentage of everything they bring in. At Health Stop and Doctors Walk-In, the doctors are sent monthly computer printouts ranking them according to their average fees per patient. The monthly report `` shows that if you wanted to make more money, you could. There are definitely some doctors who order more tests because of it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Maffeo </PERSON>, a Boston-area Health Stop physician who also said she herself was never pressured. `` There is always in the back of your mind the realization that the more tests you order, the more finances you can generate for yourself,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Garlisi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, a former Doctors Walk-In physician. `` It was n't the primary motivating factor, but as human beings it's hard to ignore.'' <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, owner of Doctor's Walk-In, denied the firm encouraged physicians to run up the bill. `` I want them to treat patients appropriately,'' he said. `` We are just trying to practice basic medicine, to take care of sick people in a humane way.'' A productivity sheet from Doctors Walk-In showed the top-ranked physician charged $ 58 per patient. The last-place doctor had average charges of $ 31. These sheets also showed how many patients the doctors saw per hour and the total value of medicines their patients bought at the clinic. A Health Stop monthly report from 1987 showed the average number of X-rays, tests and procedures per patient for each doctor. The doctors' total bills ranged on average from $ 76 to $ 44. The chain's average was $ 62 The physician with the lowest charges was Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, one of two Health Stop doctors who assert they were fired in 1987 for doing too few tests and X-rays. Neither doctor had written proof of this. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, now a physician at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> student infirmary, said he rarely used diagnostic machines. `` If somebody came in with a sore throat, they did n't need a blood count. They -LRB- Health Stop officials -RRB- wanted routine tests done for routine problems,'' he said. The other dismissed doctor was <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bock </PERSON>, who now operates his own walk-in clinic in <LOCATION> Revere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. He said he resisted ordering tests when his stethoscope and a physical exam provided all the information he needed.

<TEXT>
 While owners of walk-in medical chains deny pumping up patient charges, some former employees assert they were pressured and enticed to inflate the bills. Among the most frequently cited examples: _ Some chains encourage doctors to routinely perform simple diagnostic tests, such as strep screens on all people with sore throats, when there is little indication patients have diseases they are being tested for. The tests typically cost about $ 20. _ Chest X-rays to check for pneumonia are routinely given to people with coughs and bronchitis, even though most have simple colds. Costs vary across the country but are often in the $ 50 range. _ Many chains give doctors bonuses for amassing big patient bills. One doctor said his chain gave physicians 40 percent of every bill that went over $ 60. _ Doctors are often encouraged to prescribe antibiotics to patients who do n't need them, so customers will feel they have gotten their money's worth. When the clinics sell the drugs they also prescribe, this of course further raises profits. At one walk-in chain, one of every four patients bought medicines and paid an average of $ 8.60 per prescription.

The spree of corporate takeover maneuvering sounded like a financial clone of college basketball's March Madness and was about the only thing that captivated Wall Street's attention this past week _ besides brokers' bets on the nationally televised <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> tournament.

Three were announced the same day, resurrecting memories of the frenzy of huge deals that had become almost routine in the past few years but _ until now _ seemed to have waned in 1989. Stock speculators and others who follow buyouts said the rash of announcements was more than coincidence. For one thing, more than five months have elapsed since the granddaddy $ 24.53 billion <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> takeover brawl, which chilled many other deals, rumored and real. That megadeal raised fears that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would crack down on one of investment banking's most lucrative businesses, partly because of the enormous amount of debt used to finance many mergers and because of questions over how it could be repaid. The <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> deal now has been digested, with little outwardly dramatic impact. In addition, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawmakers appear unwilling or unable to more tightly regulate or constrict takeovers. Moreover, rising interest rates appear to be playing a role by convincing some takeover investors to make their move now before the cost of credit gets too expensive. But perhaps the most significant takeover news of the week was the evident success of an antitakeover strategy. Instant camera giant <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, hounded for months by the <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> investment concern, won a court battle upholding the legitimacy of a stock repurchase that seemed to squelch <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 3.2 billion bid. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> declined to admit defeat but planned to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock. In another successful escape, chemical concern <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> embraced a friendly $ 1.05 billion acquisition by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>, foiling an unwanted takeover by the Centaur Partners investment concern. Centaur dropped its bid but still walks away with big profits, a demonstration that even in failure in the takeover business there's success: it paid about $ 60-a-share for a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> and can sell out to <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> for $ 132 a share A third corporate rescue concerned <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, target of an unwanted takeover threat from the investment partnership <ORGANIZATION> Topper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toolmaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.8 billion, but <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> sought to stop the deal in court. Elsewhere, billionaire takeover investor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> decided to add camping gear to his collection of perfume, licorice extract and savings and loan businesses. <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, Kan.-based <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accepted a $ 545 million buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> MacAndrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, and spurned a rival management-led offer. Another savvy takeover strategist, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, teamed with <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to acquire plastics maker <ORGANIZATION> Envirodyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 736 million. It marked <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s first takeover foray since he helped investment concern <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> acquire <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> three years ago. In the rumor realm, word leaked that billionaire investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> had purchased stock in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with the possible aim of buying the publishing giant. Stock in Time, which earlier this month agreed to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> partly as an antitakeover move, soared on the Bass story. Finally, one friendly deal turned sour. <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> demanded at least a third off the $ 365 million price he had agreed to pay for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shuttle because the carrier has since been crippled by a strike and has sought refuge in bankruptcy court. In response, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> made the shuttle available to all bidders. In other business and economic news this past week: _ A jury convicted an assistant bond trader at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of perjury and other charges, making her the first employee of the securities firm to be found guilty as a result of a massive federal fraud inquiry Another jury deadlocked in deliberating stock manipulation charges against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a top company officer, resulting in the second mistrial in that case. _ One week after news about inflation frightened the financial markets, new evidence emerged that the economy is slowing The government said durable goods orders fell in February, the second straight monthly drop, consumer prices rose only moderately and more Americans diverted their income into savings. The Big Three automakers, meanwhile, reported soft sales for mid-March. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a minimum wage bill, raising the prospect of a $ 1.10-an-hour rise in compensation for the nation's lowest paid workers The passage came during the same week a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel released report that showed a widening gap between rich and poor from 1973 through 1987.

<HEAD>Eastern Bankruptcy Judge to Appoint Examiner with Broad Powers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Embattled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has been granted its request for a court-appointed examiner in its bankruptcy proceedings, but the airline appears to be getting a more powerful examiner than it wanted. In a surprising ruling Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said he would appoint an examiner with unusually broad powers to oversee strike-bound Eastern during its Chapter 11 reorganization. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> granted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request that an examiner be appointed to review all transactions between Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and affiliated airlines. But he decided to give the examiner a broader mandate than requested by the airline, saying it was in the public's interest to do so Among other things, the as-yet unnamed examiner would mediate differences among Eastern employees, creditors and other parties to achieve a consensus on a bankruptcy reorganization plan, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said. He described that role as `` banging heads together by an independent entity.'' The judge also refused a union request to order Eastern to release about $ 24 million in pre-strike paychecks and benefits frozen when the airline sought protection from creditors on March 9, five days after the beginning of a strike by its machinists union. Eastern's pilots and flight attendants have refused to cross the machininists' picket lines. The unions have asked the bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee who actually would run the airline during its reorganization, bumping <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> from that function An April 7 hearing has been scheduled on the trustee request. But an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> indicated the union might be willing to drop the request, because the powers of the new examiner would be so sweeping. `` It's rather an extraordinary appointment,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who represented <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> during Thursday's hearing, told reporters outside the courtroom. He described the new examiner to be appointed by the judge as a `` super-mediator'' and a `` super-examiner.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would be prepared to examine the trustee issue with <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lead bankruptcy attorney. `` We'll look at the order; we'll make a judgment,'' he said. Another participant in the hearing, who asked not to be identified, also said the scope of the new examiner's mandate was virtually unprecedented in a bankruptcy proceeding. `` We're extremely pleased with the ruling today,'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We wish we had thought of it,'' he said, referring to the judge's broadening of the examiner's functions. Eastern has said it made the request for an examiner to dispel arguments by its unions that transactions between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliiated acarrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> were not made in the company's best interests. Eastern's unions claim <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has been stripping the airline of its assets while trying to bolster <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. `` What I'm hearing is a reflection of parochial interests; what I'm not hearing is the public interest here,'' <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> told <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> after their presentations in front of a packed courtroom. `` The sooner we get into the gut issues here, the better off we are.'' Regarding the request to free the paychecks, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said such a move would be of `` no demonstrable benefit'' to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s estate and would consume about 10 percent of the company's cash on hand. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>'s decision on the checks was a setback to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s employees.

<HEAD>Car, Truck Sales Up 5 Percent in Mid-March</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Car and light truck sales rose 5 percent in mid-March, but an industry analyst said the improvement does n't indicate a turnaround in a slow sales start for 1989 The eight U.S.-based auto companies reported Thursday that vehicles they made sold at an average daily rate of 39,225 during the March 11-20 period this year, compared with a 37,344-per-day rate during the same time last year. But that did n't impress analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It's very disappointing when you consider that the industry made the incentives more generous,'' he said. During early March, the Big Three automakers, which accounted for 90.3 percent of all the cars sold by the eight companies during the second 10-day selling period of the month, boosted or extended existing incentives. In mid-March last year, similar incentives were in place. `` What I think is happening is that consumers are reacting to increased interest rates, not automobile rates, though,'' <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said, adding that holders of adjustable rate mortgages may have recently received notice of higher payments because of increases in lending rates nationwide. Another analyst, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was more bullish on the industry. `` I think a lot of people have been shopping, just kind of looking for what to buy,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` Why buy when there's a chance of snow or rotten weather? Get past Easter Sunday and you should see sales smooth out at a higher level.'' `` All you're seeing is that the market is being jerked back and forth by incentives or lack thereof,'' he said. Mid-March sales were bolstered by light trucks, which were leaving dealer lots in numbers 8.9 percent higher than last year. Car sales went up 2.8 percent compared with the same period last year. Automakers have been looking for a sales resurgence in March and April after a sluggish start early this year. Typically, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers head to automobile showrooms during the early spring to get ready for summertime driving. For the year, cars and light trucks are selling at a pace 5.4 percent behind last year's tempo. The automakers sold an average of 34,475 vehicles a day through March 20 this year, compared with a daily rate of 36,451 during the same period last year. Car sales were off 8.2 percent and truck sales were 0.3 percent lower so far this year than they were during the Jan. 1-March 20 period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it sold 16.2 percent fewer cars during mid-March this year compared with last year, with sales averaging 3,228 a day this year, compared with a 3,850 car-a-day clip last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s mid-March car sales were up 6.1 percent this year and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s were 0.2 percent ahead of last year's sales rate. Year-to-date car sales for each of the Big Three were running behind last year's pace, with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> down 20.7 percent, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> 12.7 percent lower and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> off 2.1 percent. It was a different story for the Big Three on the truck side, as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> showed a 10.6 percent increase, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was up 6.7 percent and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales were 5.5 percent higher in mid-March this year compared with the same period last year.

<HEAD>Big Name Chocolate Makers Taking Bigger Bite Of Easter Markets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Major chocolate companies moving into the Easter specialty candy market are getting a sweet reward in the form of higher sales. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confectioners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is projecting a 2 percent increase in sales of Easter chocolate and candy this year, up to $ 815 million. `` Seasonal chocolates are really big business,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steuer </PERSON>, president of Chocolate Marketing of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` There are predictions that the market will top out _ how much more chocolate can people take? _ but I believe that there's a world of opportunity.'' While seasonal confections were once supplied mostly by specialty makers of chocolate bunnies and marshmallow eggs, candy giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M-Mars are trying to get a bigger bite of the profitable Easter candy market with holiday versions of their regular products. <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> has packaged its chocolate Kisses in <LOCATION> Easter </LOCATION> _ and Christmas _ colors for years. Its recent acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>'s, which makes several popular chocolate Easter egg items, will increase its seasonal sales considerably, company spokesman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` The company found that there's quite a market for special packaging for existing products,'' said analyst <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> <PERSON> Offutt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Offutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't tell you exactly what the incremental gain in sales has been, but I do think it has surpassed their expectations by a large margin,'' he said. Mars, which together with <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> controls most of the chocolate market, introduced red and green M & amp; M type candies at Christmas three years ago, and last year added pastel versions at Easter. `` The sales results were very, very successful,'' said Mars spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiuczynski </PERSON>. `` The seasonal market certainly has been growing.'' Analysts and industry specialists said the chocolate giants' foray into the holiday market is not hurting the smaller, specialty confectioners `` The big guys are starting to pay attention to the season,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON>, associate publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` It's healthy for the market and provides a greater choice. But I do n't believe it's taking sales away from the traditional sellers. It's expanded the market.'' The specialty producers have been expanding their sales at the same time as the mass marketers, Ms. <PERSON> Steuer </PERSON> said. `` A lot of the importers are going to mass marketing outlets,'' she said. `` The mass companies are going upscale and the upscale companies are going into mass marketing.'' There is plenty of room for both in the Easter market, Ms. <PERSON> Steuer </PERSON> said. `` It's really a matter of incremental business and expanding the market,'' she said. `` I do n't think anyone is pushing anybody out.'' `` We're going back to more traditional thinking in terms of holidays,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chocolate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` More attention is being paid to chocolate bunnies and fancy Easter eggs and jelly beans _ all the things that go with Easter. `` Easter's been doing very well.''

<HEAD>Delaware Court Frees Polaroid to Buy Back Shares</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When a <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> removed all obstacles to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s buyback of 16 million shares of its common stock, it apparently dealt a fatal blow to <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s 8-month-old takeover attempt The court on Thursday rejected <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s request for an extension of a one-week injunction against the buyback plan, an effort by the instant camera giant to stymie <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 3.2 billion takeover bid. In response, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> and its affiliates announced plans to tender to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> all 4.96 million <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shares purchased during the takeover effort. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, Calif.-based company, refused to say whether <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> would abandon its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this week, another <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> spokesman said the company would not give up its battle for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> even if the court ruled in favor of the buyback. `` It would seem they're on the verge of giving up,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's somewhat of a fatal shot, almost a shot right to the head of Shamrock,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Their -LRB- <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s sell-back -RRB- plan is symbolically the same thing as throwing in the towel.'' However, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> is `` unlikely to go away'' and may still stage a proxy fight although, as a result of the buyback plan and individual stock ownership, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> will own enough shares to stop <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, controlled by the family of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, nephew of the late <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, planned to wage a proxy fight for control of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors at its as-yet unscheduled annual meeting. `` They could continue to pursue'' a bid, said <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, `` but with those defenses seeming so strong and supported by the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts, their ability to get 50 percent of the shares to vote for them seems very remote.'' <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said the court's endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s actions to ward off a takeover could send a signal to other Delaware-based companies that defensive strategies will be backed. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has been resisting <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s takeover attempt since July, when the company made a friendly but unsolicited offer of $ 40 a share. In January, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> increased the bid to $ 45. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, has approximately 11,000 employees worldwide and sells instant film packs, cameras, videotapes and other products.

<BYLINE>IBM Denies Slowdown In High Tech Industry</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Top executives of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> tried to allay fears of a high technology slowdown and its impact on the economy, concerns raised when earnings forecasts were cut for `` Big Blue'' and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest computer makers During a meeting of securities analysts Thursday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the men who run <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> predicted strong worldwide growth in demand for computers despite a cooling domestic market. They promised to deliver `` kinder, gentler'' computers in the short term, predicting it would be easier for individuals and more efficient for companies to use. In the long term, they said businesses would find more and more uses for computers, demanding ever larger amounts of memory capacity for `` paperless offices'' in which products would be designed entirely on computers. `` Far less than 2 percent of the data that mankind has generated is coded and stored in any kind of a computer format ... so there is still tremendous potential for growth,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> predicted the computer industry would continue to grow at two to three times the rate of the world's economy as a whole. But <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said in an interview after his speech to the 150 analysts that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit is a wild card that could change <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s hand. `` Our financial position as a country is way out of balance,'' he said. `` It's either going to come into balance, ... or there's going to continue to be a lot of economic fragility.'' The stock prices of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and its chief competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, plummeted during the past week when the companies signaled their earnings in the current quarter would fall below many analysts' estimates. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, the industry leader and the most highly capitalized company in the nation, has blamed its lower earnings forecast on a microchip manufacturing problem that has slowed delivery of its top-of-the-line mainframe 3090S computers. Production of the chips, which pack up to 2,300 memory circuits on a fingernail-sized slice of silicon, has proved more difficult than the company expected. Only 2 or 3 of every 10 chips it turns out are free of flaws and can be used. Digital, the second largest computer maker, said it has seen a softening of demand for computers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At the low end of the market, more and more powerful personal computers and workstations have cut into sales of the larger and more expensive minicomputers and mainframes. At the meeting Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executives said they have solved the chip problem and will catch up with the backlog in orders by the end of the year. They denied that the problem has hurt demand for the mainframes. Because of the manufacturing delays, Wall Street analysts forecast <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> will earn $ 10.25 to $ 10.75 a share this year, down from previous estimates of $ 11 to $ 11.25 per share. Several analysts questioned the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executives closely about the company's continuing reliance on sales of computer hardware for approximately 70 percent of its revenue, while software and computer services are the fastest growing segments of the market. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrades </PERSON>, a senior vice president, said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> realized it needed to emphasize software development and would begin `` wrapping our hardware like a burrito'' in software and support services. While the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executives declined to make specific estimates for sales or earnings growth this year, they said they expected rapid increases in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, slower growth in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and minor growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> would compete vigorously in the market for computers that use open, or freely licensed, operating systems based on Unix, an increasingly popular system developed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said that while <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> faces strong competition from Japanese computer makers, it is poised to capitalize on heavy demand for computers in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the construction of computerized manufacturing facilities by Japanese and Korean companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> officials say they may look at a 24-hour, electronic stock-trading system being developed by a competitor, but they appear to be in no hurry to link up with it. `` We're not sure there's interest in that right now,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON>. `` We're not sure that there's nough demand to make the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> go to 24-hour trading.'' Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> indicated the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> may be invited join the computerized order-matching network for stocks and stock options being developed by the Options Exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and London-based <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We certainly have not discussed excluding other exchanges,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview after the project was announced. The network would be similar to electronic trading systems being developed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s futures exchanges, theoretically giving investors around the world 24-hour access to international financial markets. But <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON> said the demand for round-the-clock stock trading is probably limited to only about 100 `` world-class'' stocks such as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, some of which are already accessible 24 hours a day because they are listed on overseas exchanges as well on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> boards. Officials said they could not estimate a start-up date for the system, which will require approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> owns the majority of memberships on the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which lists the 300 largest-volume issues traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> exchange is the only fully computerized securities market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, using a computer to match buy and sell orders. It averaged 1 million trades per day last year compared with about 170 million trades per day on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, by far the nation's largest securities market. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said the decision to develop an electronic trading system was a reaction to the increasingly international nature of investing. `` Take an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` It's traded by investors in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` We're seeing globalization enter into the stock and securities markets as it has in other markets,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. `` We want to be at the forefront by opening up access to our marketplace.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is the world's largest market for stock options and stock-index options. A stock option is a right to buy or sell 100 shares of a given stock at a specified price by a future date. Stock-index options involve baskets of stocks, such as those represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 100 and 500 indexes. Investors use stock options to reduce their risks in the stock market or to speculate on price movements. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>, a leading vendor of financial information, would supply the technology for the system through its <ORGANIZATION> Instinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> are developing a similar system, called <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, for 24-hour trading of futures contracts. A future is a binding contract to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price on a future date. <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> is expected to become operational this fall, as is <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, a competing system being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest futures market. <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> already has received commitments from three other futures exchanges, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Futures Exchange of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the French futures exchange known as <ORGANIZATION> MATIF </ORGANIZATION>, to offer some of their products for trading on the system.

<HEAD>Dow Sued Over Mortar Additive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> court is trying to determine whether a mortar additive made by Michigan-based <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> caused walls to crumble. A bank, hospitals, and now a hotel in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> are among dozens of plaintiffs that have sought damages in lawsuits spanning the last decade stemming from use of the additive, <PERSON> Sarabond </PERSON>. They claim the substance corrodes metal supports, letting bricks fall or entire walls sag. But Dow says brickwork can deteriorate for many reasons and argues that its corporate wealth _ $ 16.68 billion in 1988 revenue _ makes the Midland-based chemical giant an easy `` deep pockets'' target for lawsuits. Trial opened Monday in a suit brought by the Executive Tower Inn in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The hotel is seeking $ 190 million in actual and punitive damages from Dow. The suit is one of 28 pending cases involving Sarabond, which was sold by Dow from 1965 to 1976 and used in structures ranging from hospitals to the Eisenhower Memorial Tunnel in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Additional suits have been settled out of court. `` We do remain convinced that <PERSON> Sarabond </PERSON> is not deficient. We are back in the courtroom this week defending our position,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> said. Two previous suits have gone to trial and juries found <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> liable in both, although one is under appeal. A 1979 complaint by <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> resulted in a $ 28 million damage award and later was settled for $ 13 million. A <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, on May 3, 1988, awarded <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> $ 1.7 million in actual damages and $ 5 million in punitive damages. That judgment is being appealed. Meanwhile, new court actions continue to crop up. <ORGANIZATION> Bronson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> filed suit last month, claiming Sarabond-mortared brickwork on a service-elevator tower built in the early 1970s was deteriorating. <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> is asking damages in excess of $ 10,000. Attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorigan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, who represents the Executive Tower Inn, <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> and other Sarabond plaintiffs, has said the mortar additive releases chloride similar to road de-icing salt. Metal supports tying the mortared brickwork to the building walls or frame corrode, bricks or sections of wall crack and loosen, and in some cases bricks have fallen, <PERSON> Dorigan </PERSON> said. He said he knew of no resulting injuries, and structural damage to buildings has not been involved. Dow sold the Sarabond business in 1976 to <ORGANIZATION> Masonry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, and in the early 1980s the product ceased to be marketed. <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> said Dow sold the business because <PERSON> Sarabond </PERSON> was unprofitable. Dow maintains the mortar additive did not cause the problems that led to the lawsuits, <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> said. The company used Sarabond in its own <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> headquarters buildings as recently as 1981 with no problems, she said. <PERSON> Dorigan </PERSON> disputed that, in an interview prior to the Executive Tower Inn trial. He said he visited the Dow headquarters twice _ after obtaining court orders in two previous lawsuits _ and found rusted metal and cracked bricks both times. <PERSON> Dorigan </PERSON> said more than 20 other suits have been filed that never came to trial. Dow would n't comment on the number of suits settled or the total amount of the settlements, <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> said. `` There have been settlements over the years,'' she said. `` They are not an admission of liability. Where we can resolve suits amicably we do our best to accomplish that.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court: EPA Can't Evade Acid Rain Question by Inaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> has ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has to announce what it's going to do about changing air quality standards _ even if it's nothing The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in a 2-to-1 decision, has ruled that federal district courts can compel the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` to make some formal decision'' on whether or not to revise air quality standards. The decision reversed a lower court ruling that threw out a lawsuit by seven states and four environmental groups against the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and its administrator, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Filed in December 1985, the lawsuit sought to compel <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> to update the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s ambient air quality standards for sulphur oxides, which cause acid rain. Those sulphur oxide standards, which have n't been revised since the early 1970s, are used to set legal emission levels for pollutants the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> identifies as hazardous. While the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has revised the criteria for determining air quality standards, it has taken no public action on the standards themselves `` neither revising the existing standards nor formally declining to revise them,'' noted the 2nd Circuit opinion written by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Graafeiland </PERSON> concurred but Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> dissented. The ruling was made Wednesday and announced Thursday. The lawsuit was brought by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> as well as the Environmental Defense Fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Last April, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> ruled that for technical reasons he did not have the authority to consider the lawsuit. But the appeals court said that interpretation would leave `` a bureaucratic twilight zone'' in which EPA action or inaction would not be subject to court review. The 2nd Circuit panel ruled that while it's up to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> to decide what specific changes to make in the air quality standards, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator has a `` duty to make some formal decision'' on the need to update national air standards. The 2nd Circuit noted that shortly after <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>'s decision, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced that it was `` premature and unwise'' to change air quality standards to address the acid rain problem. The appeals court said <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> should issue an order directing the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to continue its public decision making process. `` This victory could not have come at a better time,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> in a statement issued by his office. `` It shows that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has had the power and the duty to act against acid rain all along, but that it has refused, leading to needless destruction of forests and waters throughout the Northeast.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> added: `` If the -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- administration accepts this decision without further appeal and updates the standards it will advance the cause of acid rain reduction.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> First Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said in a statement: `` The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for too long has taken a no-action approach to air pollution and acid rain. It is unfortunate that it takes litigation and a court judgement to force <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to face up to its responsibilities under the Clean Air Act. Now that the court has ruled, we trust <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will stop pondering the acid rain problem and do something about it.''

<HEAD>Centaur Drops $110-A-Share Bid For Pennwalt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Centaur Partners has finally admitted defeat in its months-long wrangle to take over <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, leaving the principal investors richer but also saying they feel disappointed. Centaur dropped its $ 110-per-share bid Thursday, three days after <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 132-per-share offer from the French government-controlled oil and chemical concern <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>. Based on the number of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares _ 8 million _ <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>'s offer amounts to more than $ 1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it would end its takeover bid coincided with <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>'s formal commencement of the offer, three days after <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors voted unanimously to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION> deal. `` We are realistic enough to know when to stop fighting,'' said <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, one of the main Centaur investors. `` We wanted to buy the company,'' said <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s partner `` But at this point, the way we see it, this price is higher than we were prepared to go. We are happy with it. It maximizes the value to all shareholders.'' It is estimated that Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, stands to make $ 60 million. The group began buying stock in the chemical company in June, when the price was $ 65 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, maintained throughout the takeover bid that Centaur never actually wanted to acquire the company but merely wanted to drive up the stock prices. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s managers proved to be `` formidable opponents,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> demonstrated his determination to oppose us, and he preferred fighting rather than sitting down and talking,'' he said. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON> said they plan to make a bid for another company. `` We will look to find other situations that we can buy that are substantially undervalued,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> had fought Centaur since the investment group first made its plans known last June. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> went to court to stop Centaur from calling a shareholders meeting, where the investment group hoped to replace the directors, paving the way for the takeover bid to succeed. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed at $ 130.25 Thursday in consolidated trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The stock's price jumped $ 13.12 -LCB- _ about 11 percent _ to $ 130.12 -LCB- when <PERSON> Elf </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquitaine </PERSON>'s offer was made public Monday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Planters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LifeSavers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> hopes customers hungry for nostalgia will savor the return of its old-fashioned flavors not seen on store shelves in decades. The company's <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> plant recently began producing the `` Limited Edition Nostalgia Flavors'' _ `` Lic-O-Rice,'' `` Choc-O-Late'' and `` Pepsin.'' Stores began carrying them a week ago. All three of the limited edition flavors were developed in the 1920s. Lic-O-Rice and Pepsin were discontinued in 1938, while Choc-O-Late was produced until 1968. `` Our society's general interest in nostalgia is booming these days, and many Americans associate LifeSavers candy with warm memories of their childhood and quieter, simpler lifestyles,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, associate product manager for the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, N.C.-based company. Company officials said the three flavors will be sold for a limited time in a response to consumers' requests. When LifeSavers candies first rolled into stores in 1912, <PERSON> Pep-O-Mint </PERSON> was the only flavor available. Over the years, 45 flavors have been sold at various times and 34 billion rolls have been purchased. Currently, 17 flavors are on the market.

<HEAD>Pharmaceutical Company Strengthens Anti-takeover Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, unaware of any efforts to accumulate stock or gain control, nevertheless has strengthened existing anti-takeover measures, Chairman <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> says. The pharmaceutical company's board of directors adopted three changes to a shareholders' rights policy adopted in 1986. `` The amendments are intended to reflect developments in case law and make the plan a more effective deterrent to the abusive takeover tactics that can be used to deprive shareholders of the full value of their investment,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said Thursday. Shareholders now can acquire stock at half-price if any party acquires 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares. Previously, an acquirer also had to take other action such as a merger or sale of assets. The market value of <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock totals about $ 6 billion, meaning an investment of more than $ 1 billion would be needed to gain a 20 percent stake. Making it easier for current shareholders to obtain additional stock in the event of a takeover bid would increase the number of shares outstanding, diluting a would-be acquirer's stake, spokesman R.D. <PERSON> LaRue </PERSON> said. Another amendment would let the board accept <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> shares rather than cash for such transactions _ extending the plan to stockholders lacking ready cash. A third change would let the board carry out the transactions for up to 30 days after anyone obtained 20 percent or more of the company's stock, rather than only prior to that time. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>, a worldwide manufacturer and marketer of human and animal health care products and services, had 1988 revenue of $ 2.75 billion.

 A company that admitted selling defective heart pacemakers has agreed to pay $ 5 million to settle claims that it defrauded the government, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is satisfied with the agreement, said <PERSON> Chick </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, vice president for corporate relations, who noted that the company already has spent $ 4 million in legal fees and associated costs. `` What we did is we paid $ 1 million yesterday with the signing, and the balance of $ 4 million will be paid in three equal annual installments at 7 -LCB- percent interest,'' <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said Thursday. The agreement, announced Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, was simply to reimburse the government for pacemakers purchased directly by the Veterans Administration or that were subject to reimbursement through Medicare and Medicaid programs. It would not provide payments to anyone who had a faulty pacemaker implanted or the survivors of anyone who died because of it, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has alleged that the devices could stop without warning, and said that between December 1983 and October 1985 the company shipped 2,200 pacemakers subject to potential failure and 6,000 batteries even though it knew they were subject to corrosion. The settlement did not indicate how many pacemakers the reimbursement covered. <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said there have n't been any suits brought by those people who bought the pacemakers themselves or who had them implanted by the VA.. Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the settlement would not preclude such individuals from suing the company <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, assistant attorney general in charge of the department's Civil Division, said the settlement is believed to be one of the largest Medicare recoveries ever. The out-of-court settlemet of civil claims is unconnected with criminal charges against <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION>, which sold off its pacemaker business two years ago to <ORGANIZATION> Telectronics </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian medical device manufacturer. In the criminal case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last October rejected a plea-bargain arrangement between <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> and federal prosecutors under which the company would have pleaded guilty to 23 counts of selling defective pacemakers and would have paid $ 123,000 in criminal fines and $ 141,000 in costs. The judge said the payment was too low. A new agreement is to be presented next week to <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said. Under that plan, <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> would plead guilty to 12 felony and 13 misdemeanor counts and pay the government more than $ 700,000 in fines and costs of the investigation, he said. The agreement would not affect a separate indictment of four former <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> officers, who have all pleaded innocent. The company reported net losses of $ 56.1 million in 1987, but underwent a major restructuring since selling the pacemaker operation. Net earnings for 1988 totaled $ 2.4 million on sales of $ 132 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> probably wo n't result in immediate changes for the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> manufacturer, an auto analyst says. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Prebe </PERSON>, an independent consultant and formerly <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist, said Thursday that some white collar jobs at Champion's <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> headquarters are likely to be phased out over the next year as Houston-based <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> assumes more control of Champion. `` <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> will begin to absorb their name into their parts network. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> also will begin to absorb Champion departments into their operations. After a period of time, they will determine what they will do with the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> operation,'' he said. `` But I see some of Champion's management, including department heads, being let go or assigned new positions,'' he said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> announced Thursday that it had purchased 83.2 percent of Champion common stock, moving it a step closer toward a planned merger with the spark plug maker. When completed, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> will have paid $ 707 million for the 33.6 million outstanding shares of Champion common stock. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thursdsy </PERSON> that the company bought the shares for $ 21 a share. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> needed 50.1 percent ownership to take control. Champion stock closed at 20 -RRB-, down 1 \, in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday The merger was approved by directors of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and Champion on Feb. 22. `` We're in good shape,'' Ms. <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said from the company's <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters `` The merger will go through. The actual legal merger wo n't take place until after May 1.'' After the merger, shares not acquired in the original cash tender offer will be exchanged for $ 21 a share in cash, she said. The deal, including debt reduction, legal fees and other considerations, brings the total purchase price to about $ 800 million, she said. The announcement ends nearly two months of speculation and rumors about a Champion purchase. On Jan. 25, <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>, a Toledo auto parts firm, offered to buy Champion for $ 590 million in cash and stock. A week later, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said it would offer at least $ 21-a-share cash for Champion. Champion stock has traded above $ 21 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, fueling rumors that <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> would have to up its bid. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> has not said whether it would move Champion's headquarters from <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s tender offer, launched Feb. 23, expired at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. Among the shares tendered were those of <ORGANIZATION> Chinook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, which was established in 1986 by the founding <PERSON> Stranahan </PERSON> family to maintain a dominant voice in Champion's affairs. It controlled 35 percent of Champion's common Stock. Champion is the world's leading manufacturer of spark plugs for all types of internal combustion engine. It has annual revenue of about $ 720 million and employs about 9,200 workers worldwide. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, with 1988 revenue of $ 4.3 billion, makes products for the electrical, electronic, commercial, industrial, compression and drilling markets.

 Five million Japanese women have entered the work force in the past 13 years, but many suffer from sex discrimination despite government efforts to protect them, an official report said today. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s office said the number of women in the work force has increased from 12 million in 1975 to 17 million in 1988 _ roughly 40 percent of the total work force. However, an official for the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s office, <PERSON> Kiyoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujii </PERSON>, said few women get responsible positions in management or as specialists, despite <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 1981 Equal Opportunity Employment Law. For example, only 29 women are representatives in the 764-member parliament, she said. More than 63 percent of all working women who responded to a government survey in 1987 complained of unequal treatment, said a report by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s office. Although many private companies have begun providing equal opportunities for female job-seekers, women face discrimination in promotions, pay and working conditions, Ms. <PERSON> Fujii </PERSON> said. She also charged that `` general position'' examinations for promotions may discriminate against women. The test does not violate the 1981 law because it involves promotion, not hiring, she said. Lack of child care facilities at work sites is also a big obstacle for mothers who want to keep working. `` Many companies do n't allow mothers to bring their children to work,'' she said. In a 30-minute video at a government news conference today, several career women with responsible positions were introduced. `` Japanese society is still ruled by men, and the roles of each sex are stubbornly fixed. More women should take part in decision-making processes in society _ especially in politics _ to share responsibilities equally with men,'' feminist <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuita </PERSON> said in the video.

 A suspended <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official faces up to 25 years in prison for bribery in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing scandal, and a company that profited from his inside information will pay more than $ 4.3 million in fines. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> admitted on Thursday that he accepted a bribe to provide inside information on a $ 24 million contract eventually awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and two counts of making false statements to the government, and agreed to pay $ 1.5 million in penalties, $ 2 million in civil claims and $ 786,000 to reimburse the government for the cost of the investigation In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> agreed to give up its negotiated 13.5 percent profit on the contract that could result in a savings to the government of $ 4 million over the next three years, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, 51, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to commit bribery, wire fraud and filing false statements, as well as receiving a bribe as a government official and wire fraud. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hylton </PERSON> set sentencing for June 2, when <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> could face up to 25 years in prison and fines of up to $ 750,000. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> made no comment as he left the courtroom. As part of his plea agreement, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> also will cooperate with prosecutors in the continuing `` Ill Wind'' investigation, including the trial of his former co-defendants in the indictment. Those defendants in the trial scheduled to begin April 3 are defense consultants <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, as well as three <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> officials: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> was hospitalized last Friday after reportedly taking an overdose of pills. With Thursday's action, the more than 2-year-old investigation has resulted in a dozen guilty pleas that have been publicly revealed, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON>. He refused to say whether other people or companies under investigation already have agreed to plead guilty. <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> also would not disclose how extensively <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s testimony might be used against other defendants, saying only, `` The total investigation is moving along very quickly. As part of the plea agreements, prosecutors dismissed counts of bribery and wire fraud against <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>. Racketeering charges had been dropped at an earlier court hearing. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it decided to enter the plea arrangement primarily due to `` the recognition that a former employee, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON>, had entered into a corrupt and illegal arrangement with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, with whom the company had no relationship.'' `` Their purpose was to subvert the lawful operation of the government's procurement process,'' the company said. <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON> has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> had been a supervisory electronics engineer and branch head of the ship systems engineering section at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, when the actions occurred. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> received about $ 1,000 every few months from <LOCATION> Parkin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> in exchange for giving them classified documents. The indictment said the consultants were getting their information from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. He was reassigned to a non-procurement job in June 1988, when the investigation became public, and he was suspended without pay shortly after he was indicted in January. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will review his plea agreement before deciding on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s employment status, said Lt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is re-evaluating its suspension in January of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> from new contracts, but had made no decision Thursday. The $ 24 million contract at issue was for hand-held electronic testing equipment that checks whether radar transponders are working before military airplanes are allowed to fly. The Mark 12 IFF transponder test set checks the equipment that helps identify whether a plane flying nearby is a friend or foe. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> are using the equipment, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> purchased the sets under a master <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contract. Since July 1987, when <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> was awarded the contract, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has received 105 of the sets, and plans to buy 43 more this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s suspension of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> did not affect the contract already awarded.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has settled lawsuits brought by seven states by agreeing to publicize that its Samurai model may roll over in sharp turns. The company, which is based in <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also will pay $ 200,000 to cover what it cost <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to brings suits accusing <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> of false and deceptive advertising. The agreement was announced Thursday. In the settlement, which took effect Tuesday, the company made no admission of guilt or safety problems. Safety of the Samurai came into question last June after Consumer Reports magazine gave the four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle a rating of `` not acceptable.'' It said the Samurai was too short, narrow, light and high-riding to be safe and that it rolled over in a routine obstacle-avoidance test. Consumers Union, publisher of the magazine, asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to recall the more than 150,000 Samurais sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since its introduction in November 1985. The federal safety agency declined to recall the car, saying in September that the Samurai rollover rate was `` within the range of most other light utility vehicles.'' <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazza </PERSON>, vice president of the car company, issued a statement that said the agreement with the seven states `` affirms that the Samurai is a safe vehicle and strongly supports the federal government decision that there is no reason to investigate the safety of the Samurai.'' While <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> is bound, under the settlement, to include the warning in ads shown or published only in the seven states involved in the case, the company said it would be included in all national advertising. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said Thursday that the states took action because `` the federal government has, once again, failed to act to protect the consumers of this country.'' He said that under the settlement, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s print ads will have to include the statement: `` This vehicle handles differently from ordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns and abrupt maneuvers which can cause vehicles of this type to roll over. Always wear your seatbelt. For specific details, please read your owner's manual.'' A shorter version of the statement is required for television and radio ads, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Households Are Selling Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In spite of the promotional efforts of brokerage houses, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households continue to withdraw from the stock market. That news is a bit of a surprise to a lot of people, who assume that the family next door and probably most of the other neighbors _ in fact, almost everyone but them _ has a cache of blue chips or growth stocks. It's a common misconception, created in part by the strong promotional efforts of brokers, by repeated media reports and stories, and by a proliferation of how-to books that prescribe exotic investing techniques. The reality is different. For six straight years household direct ownership of stocks has fallen, and by massive amounts. Since 1982, those households have been net sellers of more than a half trillion dollars of corporate shares. Not all of that amount represents desertions from the market, because many people today prefer to invest through stock mutual funds, which act as intermediaries between market and customer. But even these funds became net sellers last year by about $ 14.7 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> data, although they remain net buyers by more than $ 52 billion since 1983. Because every sell order is matched by a buy order, somebody must be buying. Foreign investors? Not last year. While they were strong buyers in 1986 and 1987, adding $ 17.8 billion and $ 15.5 billion respectively to their portfolios, they too became sellers in 1988, reducing their holdings by $ 1.3 billion. Private pension funds? No way. For the fourth straight year they were net sellers, reducing their portfolios by $ 21 billion in 1988. Insurance companies? Yes and no. Life insurers reduced holdings by $ 2.2 billion, but fire and casualty insurance companies added $ 3.1 billion to theirs, double their net investments for 1987, the year of the big crash. The one big category of institutional buying was state and local government retirement funds, which increased net holdings by $ 23.1 billion for the year and by $ 128.5 billion for the past six years. A variety of factors help explain the phenomenon, at least superficially. The proliferation of mutual funds has lured away once-direct investors. The development of a great variety of less-risky debt instruments, especially when interest rates are rising, adds to the understanding. Some analysts include need as a factor. A demographic bulge of families in the home-buying years may have been cashing in inheritances to buy houses, which have soared in price in the 1980s. And retired parents, beneficiaries of big gains from post-World War II investments, have come to a time in life when redemption seems more sensible. The decline of household investments in the market, therefore, need not be interpreted as a growing cynicism about stocks. But it does shatter a widespread and disturbing myth, that every household but yours has a net egg of shares they can tap whenever the need or urge arises. If they had such a cache, there's a good chance they've already dipped into it. The statistics, at least, seem to suggest that.

<HEAD>Profit Down 25 Percent in 2nd Qtr.; Attributed to Sale of Hospitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its second-quarter profit was 25 percent below levels of a year ago, primarily because the company sold 36 of its hospitals to an employee stock plan. The health care company said it earned $ 18.1 million, or 26 cents a share, in the second quarter, down from $ 24.1 million, or 30 cents a share in the second quarter of 1988. Sales in the quarter ended Feb. 28 were $ 678.2 million, down from $ 766.1 million a year ago. If the previous year's figure was adjusted to remove results from the hospitals that were sold, the company said, second-quarter sales would have totaled $ 611.3 million. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> owns 55 hospitals and psychiatric treatment centers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 20 such facilities overseas. The company sold 36 hospitals to <ORGANIZATION> EPIC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healthcare </ORGANIZATION>, an employee stock ownership plan, on Sept. 20, 1988. First-quarter profits also were depressed by the addition of $ 13 million to the company's reserve for potential malpractice suits and $ 11 million to buy out leases as part of a headquarters consolidation program. In the first six months of this fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 18.6 million, or 26 cents a share, down from $ 63.3 million, or 76 cents a share a year earlier. Sales were $ 1.32 billion, down from $ 1.51 billion a year earlier.

 A green flag sent about 100 Europeans thundering down the road in their vintage <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> Friday for a seven-week tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to celebrate the 25th birthday of the classic <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sportscar. Some 37 pre-1973 Mustangs were shipped into the Port of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> for the 7,000-mile trek. Drivers from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> were joined on the first leg of the journey to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> by about 50 <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> from the Southeast. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Manners </PERSON>, a Swiss maintenance electrician who organized the so-called American Pony Drive, said driving a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> across the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> is akin to an American driving a <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> across <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It provides an excellent excuse for everybody to do what they've always wanted to do,'' said Manners, who has been planning the tour for three years. The cars will cover 200 miles a day or less, Manners said. A large number of American Mustang enthusiasts are expected to join in along the way. <PERSON> Jerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Pflugger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Solothurn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, proudly displayed his restored 1972 Mustang, which is painted with a design or red, yellow and orange. `` I wanted some exciting painting,'' he said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON>, Mustang owners from <LOCATION> Roswell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, joined the tour and planned to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> before returning home. <PERSON> Holm </PERSON>, 47, recently restored the car he bought new in 1964, putting in a new engine and undercarriage. `` We were just kids when we bought this car,'' he said. `` It was our fun car.'' From <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, the Mustang caravan will make stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, among other stops.

<HEAD>Credit Card Interest Rates Creeping Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In springtime, consumers' thoughts turn to sprucing up themselves and their surroundings. That often means pulling out the plastic. But this spring, many credit cardholders who do n't pay their balances each month will shell out more in interest than they would have a year ago because rates have been creeping up on cards since last summer. Among the big credit-card issuers, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> this month nudged up interest rates for new subscribers to 19.8 percent annually from 17.5 percent. The interest rate for about one-third of existing subscribers also is rising; for the rest, rates will remain unchanged, the bank says. Chase, which handles more credit-card accounts than anyone in the business besides <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>., had been offering the lowest average rate of all major issuers The interest rate was also raised by Baltimore-based <ORGANIZATION> MNC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which ranks among the top ten biggest issuers in the country. Interest rates on about a quarter of its accounts went up to 18.9 percent annually from 17.9 percent. Industry leader <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> with about 23 million accounts nationally says it has n't changed rates for the past couple of years. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to answer queries on whether any increases are in the <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>'s rates have been at the high end among the big issuers, at 19.8 percent for holders of most regular, not gold, cards. People who track developments in the business say the latest increases are part of a trend that started months ago, coinciding with the direction taken by borrowing costs throughout the economy. Some yearly fees on credit cards have gone up a bit, too, but only slightly. In a number of instances, the rate increases are imposed selectivel on cardholders with histories of late payments, analysts say. Some issuers have vowed to hold out as long as possible before hoisting interest rates. Rocky Mountain BankCard and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s two largest credit-card issuers, are among those that intend to stick with the status quo for now. But bankers at the two institutions say they ca n't hold out forever if credit costs keep rising. `` We're not going to stand here and lose money,'' says <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruxton </PERSON>, senior vice president in charge of credit card operations for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which handles 225,000 accounts, is holding the line at 18.8 percent interest and keeping its fee at $ 15. Rocky Mountain BankCard, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s largest issuer and No. 10 nationwide, will hold rates at the current 18.6 percent-level, with a fee of $ 12, according to executive vice president <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumler </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, editor and publisher of the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Card </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION>, says `` We've been noticing there's been a gradual rise since July in both interest rates and annual fees.'' A survey of 200 banks around the country <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>'s newsletter conducts every two months supports the point. The average annual rate on cards was 17.24 percent in the July-August poll and 17.61 percent in the Jan.-Feb. poll Annual average fees during the same respective survey periods were $ 16.74 and $ 17.29. In the battle for market share, competing issuers are concentrating on fostering customer loyalty and paying relatively less attention to interest rate levels. Some analysts say annual interest rates on credit cards would have to pass the 20 percent threshold before customers would squawk. And, to the roughly 40 percent of cardholders who pay up each month, the rate is irrelevant. `` There's an overwhelming attention to customer service, which suggests that bankers have concluded that very few customers will switch -LRB- cards -RRB- within a fairly wide range of interest rates,'' <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, has emphasized enhancements in recent years to woo customers. It offers cardholders fringe benefits ranging from lost-luggage insurance to toll-free telephone information numbers. `` They are a good example of the power of customer service and enhancements and the willingness to accept cardholders with a wide range of credit histories,'' says <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>. `` The battle now for customer loyalty is not whether you can get consumers to accept your card ...'' but to `` encourage card use,'' he says. `` Wallets and purses are saturated with plastic right now.''

<HEAD>Coffee Market Turns Jittery; Return to Free Market Feared</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<HEAD>AP Business Writer</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A lot of coffee traders are getting the jitters these days, and it's not because they're drinking too much java. The nervousness reflects a growing fear that international tensions will destroy the market's 26-year-old price-support system and allow free-market forces to prevail, with lower prices the likely result. Concerns about that prospect took center stage at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> during the past week and are likely to intensify as representatives from the world's largest coffee-producing and coffee-consuming nations prepare for a 2-week conference in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> The April 4-19 meeting is the last regularly scheduled gathering of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> before Sept. 30, when the organization's 6-year price-support agreement expires. Delegates of the 74-nation group last met in February and made negligible progress on addressing consumer-nation demands aimed at increasing the availability of mild coffees, the type preferred by growing numbers of coffee drinkers. Mild coffees are grown mainly in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> while the less-flavorful robusta coffees are produced primarily in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The failure of the February session prompted heavy selling of coffee futures in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, dropping the price for May delivery below $ 1.23 a pound on Feb. 21, just 7 weeks after the contract had traded at a 2-year of nearly $ 1.60 a pound. A weak recovery pushed the May contract back up above $ 1.35 by March 17 but prices tumbled again in the past week as pre-meeting jitters gripped the market. Coffee for May delivery plunged below $ 1.27 by Wednesday and finished the week Thursday at $ 1.2859 a pound. The market was closed on Friday. `` I think perhaps the market was overcome by pessimism surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It does not look like the two sides have really come a long way in terms of bridging their differences.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> helped create the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1963 after coffee-producing nations had tried and failed for many years to control coffee prices through self-imposed export quotas and stockpiling. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s price-control system also hinges on export quotas designed to keep prices within a range, currently $ 1.20 to $ 1.40 a pound. The organization's consumer members agree to observe the price floor and to limit their purchases of coffee from non-ICO producers. The main issue facing delegates to next month's meeting is a demand by consumer nations, of which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest, that the quota system be revamped to increase the proportion of mild coffees to less-flavorful robusta coffees in the overall export mix. The producer nations, of which <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is the largest, object to that demand on the grounds that growers of robusta coffees need protection in the face of steadily declining coffee consumption. According to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, per capita coffee consumption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell to 1.67 cups a day in 1988 from 3.12 cups a day in 1962. The percentage of coffee drinkers in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population dropped to 50 percent from nearly 75 percent during the same period. So fiercely have the two sides clung to their positions that both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> have threatened in previous meetings to drop out of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the current agreement. Analysts say the organization could not survive without the participation of both countries. `` With an agreement -LRB- on quotas -RRB- we hold these price levels,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a coffee broker with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Without an agreement, we're going downtown.'' Here are some commodity price trends for the past week, which had only four trading days due to the Easter holiday: Grain futures prices declined while soybean futures rose slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat for delivery in May settled Thursday at $ 4.28 \ a bushel, down from $ 4.40 -LCB- on the previous Friday; May corn fell to $ 2.77 -RCB- a bushel from $ 2.82 \; May oats dropped to $ 2.05 \ a bushel from $ 2.12 -RCB-; May soybeans rose to $ 7.84 -LCB- a bushel from $ Cattle futures advanced while pork futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. April live cattle rallied to 78.20 cents a pound from 78.05 cents; April feeder cattle rose to 81.02 cents a pound from 80.42 cents; April live hogs dipped to 42.70 cents a pound from 43.65 cents; May frozen pork bellies slipped to 38.15 cents a pound from 38.17 cents. Gold and silver futures declined on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. April gold inched down to $ 393.40 a troy ounce from $ 393.60; May silver skidded to $ 6.058 a troy ounce from $ 6.195. Energy futures gained on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil for May delivery rallied to $ 20.15 a barrel from $ 19.48 a barrel; April heating oil surged to 56.52 cents a gallon from 53.57 cents; unleaded gasoline advanced to 58.02 cents a gallon from 55.62 cents.

<HEAD>Exotic, Futuristic Expositions the Latest Rage in Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Exotic birds, a space camp and azaleas are some of the attractions tempting travelers this year as cities throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> join this country's latest fad: the exposition boom. On Saturday, the port of <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> opens its $ 775 million centennial exposition, the <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> Exotic Showcase, featuring a space camp for kids, French and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art collectons and a high-tech train. <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> is one of 15 Japanese cities investing millions of dollars on expositions they hope will attract more Japanese and foreign visitors and give them a more cosmopolitan image. Throughout the spring and summer, <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> will be competing for visitors with the <LOCATION> Himeji </LOCATION> Shirotopia Exposition 1989 in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION>'s Asian-Pacific Exposition, called <LOCATION> Yokatopia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Yamagata </LOCATION>'s Omiyage -LRB- Souvenir -RRB- World and <LOCATION> Nagoya </LOCATION>'s Design Expo'89, among others. The Asian-Pacific Expo in <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> on the southwestern island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> is typical of Japanese expositions in that it offers a bit of something for everyone _ including many attractions only loosely related to its theme of `` The Quest for New Communication in Our World.'' Visitors to the seaside expo site can see Micronesian villages and exotic Asian birds, watch a three-dimensional movie, ride a ferris wheel and sample foods from other Asian nations. Organizers said they expect more than 6 million visitors to <LOCATION> Yokatopia </LOCATION>, which opened March 17 and runs until Sept. 3. At <LOCATION> Himeji </LOCATION>'s exposition, which started March 18, visitors can see a 3-D documentary or wander through a historic commercial `` district'' near the majestic white castle that dominates the city. The expositions have the added benefit of giving some cities a facelift. <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION>, for example, has spent millions of dollars to improve transportation facilities, organizers said. <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> plans to use revenues from its anticipated 18 million visitors to help fund a waterfront development project. A tally of organizers' estimates shows attendance at expositions this year could be more than 36 million. But the many expositions connected with centennial celebrations of Japanese cities has raised the risk that some will suffer from the competition, particularly the smaller ones featuring such attractions as azalea displays, souvenirs and food. Last year, of the 14 expositions staged throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, at least two lost a lot of money. The Sapporo World Food Festival on the northern island of Hokkaido reportedly lost more than $ 62 million and another festival near the <LOCATION> Seto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> lost $ 651,000. Expositions are n't cheap. Tickets for this year's events cost between $ 9 and $ 21 for adults and $ 5 to $ 10 for students _ prices that make family visits expensive.

<HEAD>IRS Modifies Diesel Tax Collection For Farmers, Off-Road Users</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, bowing to pressure from farm state lawmakers, announced Friday that it will allow small wholesalers and some retailers to make sales of diesel fuel without the payment of tax. In issuing its notice, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agreed to lower the standards for wholesaler distributors ad some retailers to qualify for an exemption from the 15.1-cent-a-gallon tax for sales to farmers, fishermen and others who buy diesel for off-road use. For example, one new standard will allow distributors to automatically qualify for an exemption if at least 70 percent of their bulk sales of diesel are to users who do not have to pay the tax, such as farmers. A key change will define bulk sales as those of at least 25 gallons involving storage tanks of 50 gallons or more. That means under certain circumstances, small retailers can qualify for a tax-exemption if 50 percent of their diesel sales are for bulk amounts of at least 25 gallons. Before the change, diesel distributors generally had to charge the tax unless at least 30 percent of bulk sales were in amounts of at least 250 gallons. The policy drew many complaints. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who had urged a change for smaller operations, said the old standards were `` simply too high for distributors in rural areas whose customers often live 20-30 miles away and drive trucks with fuel storage tank capacities of less than 100 gallons. The diesel fuel tax dispute stems from a 1987 law by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that shifted collection of the tax from retail outlets to wholesalers and producers. That revision caused a storm of protest because it forced farmers and other off-road users of diesel to pay the tax and then apply for a refund. Last year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tried to end the controversy by allowing diesel purchased for off-road use from wholesalers to escape the tax. However, purchases from retailers continued to be subject to the tax. The latest <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> action sought to resolve continuing complaints by modifying regulatory definitions to cover smaller sales, including by retailers operating as bulk distributors.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> may have lost its battle to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but it is likely to walk away with a $ 40 million profit before expenses, analysts estimated Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has yet to claim victory, and <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has not conceded defeat, but Wall Street analysts said the eight-month fight for control of the instant photography company was essentially over. Shamrock, which offered $ 45 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock, was stymied Thursday by a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court decision clearing the way for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> to repurchase 16 million shares for $ 50 each. Polaroid spokesman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON> said stockholders had tendered a total of 58.6 million shares to the Cambridge-based company by Thursday's midnight deadline. Since that is roughly four times more shares than <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> plans to buy, the company will pro-rate the number of shares it accepts from each stockholder. Based on preliminary calculations, it expects to buy 27 percent of the shares tendered by each owner, <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, which amassed 4.95 million <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shares during the takeover battle, tendered all of its shares, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, Calif.-based radio and television concern. According to filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> paid an average of about $ 31 a share for its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. By selling 27 percent of its shares back to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> at $ 50 each, <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> can expect to receive approximately $ 67 million. The value of <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s remaining shares is uncertain because many analysts expect <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, which closed Thursday at $ 40.25 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, to slip to $ 38 or $ 37 a share after the buyback, said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Still, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s remaining 3.6 million <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shares would conservatively be worth more than $ 130 million, yielding a profit of approximately $ 42 million before legal fees and other expenses. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said the final number of shares tendered under the buyback offer and the definitive pro-rating formula will be determined April 4. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> still has appeals pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s employee stock ownership plan and its sale of $ 300 million in stock to <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> City-based investment group that supports <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s current management. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has not called off its proxy fight for control over <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, even though tendering its shares under the buyback plan sharply decreases its chance of winning that fight.

<HEAD>Hopes Persist For Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While the headlines focus on inflation worries and tighter credit, some Wall Street analysts are sticking with their forecasts that interest rates are headed lower soon. They contend that the economy sent out signals in February that it was beginning to slacken, even though the producer price index of goods traded at the wholesale level jumped 1 percent for the second straight month. And they maintain that more evidence of a slowdown in growth is coming soon, helping to persuade both bond traders and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> that further increases in interest rates are n't needed to restrain inflation. On Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to report the index of leading economic indicators for February. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenbaum </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> projects that the index, which is designed to detect future swings in the economy, will post a drop of about 0.5 percent. That would mark the first decline in five months. `` A modest uptrend in inflation rates has taken hold, but the market may be exaggerating the potential extent of the rise,'' <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> said in its economic commentary for the week ahead. `` February economic data have been surprisingly soft. The market's preoccupation with inflation suggests that this may have been overlooked. `` Will today's inflation fears give way to recession fears over the next two quarters?'' Recession fears might be something less than a balm for the stock market, but they would logically stand to benefit the market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. If bond traders were expecting the economy to slacken, they might well bid aggressively for government securities to profit from any approaching decline in interest rates. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, maintains that `` evidence is mounting that during the second quarter an important peak in interest rates should occur.'' <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON> says one significant signal in this direction has been a decline since last summer in commodity prices, as measured by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s futures index. Many bond market participants watch commodity price indexes closely as a guide to what future trends in inflation might look like. Past peaks in interest rates have come about 10 months after the CRB futures index crested, <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON> says. `` About nine months ago we forecasted that the second quarter of 1989 was likely to produce an important low'' for bond prices, he says. `` Although recent inflation data would seem to argue that interest rates must move higher, we stand by our earlier forecast.'' Whether the problem was inflation and interest rate worries or increased talk of a recession, the stock market showed little zip in the past week, shortened by one trading day in observance of Good Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 49.10 to 2,243.04. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index fell 2.02 to 162.64; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 1.25 to 400.94, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 3.49 at 324.87. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 148.40 million shares a day, down from 177.28 million the week before. Last Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> made a modest shift from stocks to cash in its guidelines for the allocation of investors' assets. `` Clearly, the pressure is on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its credit policy,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clough </PERSON>, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>'s chief investment strategist. `` However, we believe that most of the upward pressure on rates will remain at the short end of the yield curve and that any move up from here in long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond yields will be limited in time and degree. `` We believe that this rise in long-term rates will prove to be an opportunity to lock in attractive yields.''

<TEXT>
 Shipments of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> red apples fell sharply last week, the biggest drop since a nationwide health scare over a controversial growth additive began in late February, the industry reported Friday. Shipments also dropped significantly in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, another major apple producing state. Total out-of-state shipments from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> fell by 159,000 boxes compared with the week before, according to the weekly figures compiled by the state <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from warehouses. Shipments of Red Delicious apples, the top-selling variety, fell by 178,000 42-pound boxes, but the loss was offset by a jump in sales of <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> apples to fill the void left when <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiths </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> were pulled from markets, officials said. Alar is used primarily on red apples, although the industry contends that only 5 percent of the crop is sprayed with the growth regulator. Based on Thursday's prices for the top three varieties, the sales drop will cost <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growers about $ 1.3 million for the week. `` I think it's a combination of Alar and the general fear a lot of people seem to have involving all produce right now,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wenatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks shipments. The shipment figures are considered an accurate measure of consumer sales. Apple warehouses in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> shipped 1.25 million boxes out-of-state last week, down 11.3 percent from 1.41 million boxes the previous week and off 19.9 percent from the 1.56 million boxes the week before that, <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> said. The warehouses shipped 1.64 million boxes during the third week of March last year, he said. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the Fruit and Vegetable Market News of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> said shipments for the week ending March 18 were 110,955 bushels, down 30 percent from the 159,149 bushels shipped the week ending March 4. A bushel of apples, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says is from 42 to 50 pounds. For the week ending March 11, 133,762 bushels were shipped. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, apple exports showed a 57,000-box drop, from 138,000 the week before to 81,000 boxes shipped last week, <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> said. Much of that is the decision by Taiwanese importers, the industry's largest offshore market, to reduce purchases of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apples by around 30,000 boxes per week, <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> said. In addition, the industry generally begins to suffer from reduced exports at this time of year because of competition from newly harvested apples from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is the nation's largest apple producer and generally supplies over three-quarters of the nation's supermarket apples this time of year, said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Growers-Shippers. `` This is the first week we've been down appreciably from a year ago,'' <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said. The second consecutive week of lower sales is bad news for an industry that still has 40 percent of the fall crop in special cold storage, <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said. Those 24.6 million boxes must be sold by the time of the fall harvest, he said. In the past two weeks, shipments of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apples to retailers, wholesalers, institutional buyers, exporters and others have dropped by a combined 311,000 boxes, following three consecutive weeks of record shipments. Among the major varieties, Red Delicious apples again showed the biggest drop, 178,000 boxes to 701,000 shipped. Golden Delicious apples dropped 16,000 boxes. But shipments of <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> apples rose to 220,000 boxes, to fill the void left when <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiths </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> were banned in the wake of a cyanide scare. <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> prices are also rising, from about $ 20 per box several weeks ago to $ 26 per box Thursday, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Main </PERSON> of the federal-state <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>. The apple industry's troubles began in late February when the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer group issued a report that eating apples treated with Alar increased the cancer risk in children. That report has been disputed by federal regulators and the apple industry, but nevertheless prompted apple bans in school cafeterias, cancelation of some foreign orders and reduced retail sales.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Rule Change on Partly Cooked Chicken Strips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposed on Friday a change in federal rules to allow the manufacture of partially cooked `` breakfast strips'' from poultry meat. Under the proposal, the poultry strips would have to be cooked further by consumers to kill any food poisoning bacteria that the product might contain. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the change was sought by a processor, <ORGANIZATION> Swift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Poultry strips, he said, would provide an alternative to beef strips and pork bacon `` Some consumers may be interested in this type of product as a lower fat alternative to traditional bacon, or because of religious or dietary reasons'' he said. Current rules require that cooking temperatures for processed poultry be an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit, or 155 degrees for cooked, cured products, to kill salmonella and any other harmful organisms that might be present. Those heat levels are too high to successfully process a thin breakfast strip, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Under the proposal, the strips would be processed at 140 degress and then cooled rapidly after production. The rapid cooling and the curing process should inhibit the growth of food poisoning bacteria, he said. Additionally, the poultry strips would have to carry specific labeling instructions `` to assure that consumers know this product must be further cooked before eating,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. The instructions would tell consumers to cook the product until it is well done. Public comments can be sent by May 23 to: Policy Office, Attn: <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, Hearing Clerk, Room 3175-South, <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20250.

<TEXT>
 In an age of space shuttles and supersonic jets, trolleys are making a comeback in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, part of a multibillion dollar effort to reduce traffic, boost business and make cities more civilized. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, in the high-tech world of <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, is the latest to install an electric trolley system and endure the discomfort of digging up streets to lay track. Similar light-rail systems are rolling through <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Systems are planned in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Though they lack the history of streetcars in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, the quaint cable cars in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> or the defunct systems in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, the new trolleys are quiet and reliable. <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>'s system revives an old idea. Trolleys ran along 126 miles of track throughout the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> from the 1880s until the late 1930s. Half of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s new $ 552 million light-rail line began operating 15 months ago in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>. The other half, which will reach bedroom communities and giant <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, is expected to be completed in August 1991, cutting a 20-mile swath through the county. So far, the sleek, steel-wheeled white cars, which draw electrical power from overhead wires via antenna-like poles, have performed well and generally pleased riders. Ticket machines, with instructions in English, Vietnamese and Spanish, are easy to use and the prices are as low as 25 cents during lunchtime and 75 cents other hours. `` I just ride for the fun of it,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Esparza </PERSON>, 33, who cruises through the city, between downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> amusement park in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, after getting off his early morning job. `` It's like a Sunday drive.'' The problems that have plagued the system, however, could serve as a warning to other cities considering trolleys. A $ 140 million cost overrun, accidents, business disruptions, traffic jams, lawsuits, and accusations of mismanagement, bribery and embezzlement all were part of the trauma of building the light-rail line and transit mall. The transit mall contractor and his wife face federal tax evasion charges stemming from alleged misuse of mall funds from a $ 29.7 million contract with the county. The defendants have denied the charges. Some of the light rail's problems were unique to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, a city founded in 1777 but searching for an identity after changing from the center of an agricultural community to a part of high-powered <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The city's population is closing in fast on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s 740,000, but <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> still lacks the glamor, prestige and fame of its neighbor 50 miles north. Downtown San Jose deteriorated and the city's cohesiveness suffered as it sprawled in different directions with new companies and tract homes. Most fruit orchards vanished and the roads clogged with cars. Voters repeatedly told pollsters over the last 10 years that traffic was the area's worst problem. So light rail supporters sold it to the public on the promise it would reduce traffic, attract shoppers and tourists, helping the area gain a reputation as progressive, livable community with great weather. The only promise kept so far has been the weather. The light-rail line is criticized by those disappointed in the lack of quick improvement in downtown business and those who would rather have used transportation funds for highway improvement. `` The bitterest pill of all is the delay of constructing the freeways for a year or two after the light rail is finished,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadness </PERSON>, a critic of the line and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the general public knew what the politicians were doing, there would be a real hue and cry.'' <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Glave </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a jeweler in the city for 41 years, also has been a persistent critic of the light rail because he thinks it does n't help solve the downtown problems `` We've still got no attraction, nothing to draw people to,'' he said. He argues that the system is increasing traffic congestion rather than reducing it and is discouraging shoppers who would drive to the city. Some shopkeepers, though, are doing very well. `` We've been swamped,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaidez </PERSON>, manager of the year-old Cobbler's Bench, a shoe repair shop `` At lunchtime, we've got people waiting on line.'' <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON>, a county supervisors who's been dubbed the `` father of the light rail,'' calls the line `` a resounding success,'' even though it cost more than three times the $ 176 million spent on the 18-mile system that opened in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> two years ago. The 6,300 rides per day on the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> system over the last six months, he notes, are more than double the original forecast by transit engineers for the first half of the line. `` The only complaints are from the people who run red lights and run into it,'' <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Lockhead Faces $1.5 Million Fine For Safety Violations At Military
Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Friday proposed fining the military aircraft division of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> $ 1.5 million for worker-safety violations at the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plant where it builds the radar-evading stealth fighter. The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it is also starting a `` wall-to-wall'' inspection of the entire <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, facility because of the more than 400 violations uncovered during a four-month investigation of a classified area where the fighter is assembled. Under <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> procedures, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> has 15 working days to contest the proposed fine. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokeman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> said the company had no immediate comment on the alleged violations and likely would not comment until its management had an opportunity to review the citations. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> cited 251 instances in which it said <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> willfully failed to record illnesses and injuries to employees and 88 alleged willful violations of federal regulations requiring employers to inform workers about the potential dangers of chemicals they work with and instruct them on proper safeguards. In addition, the company was cited for another 99 violations of various <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> standards, including alleged mislabeling or failure to label chemical containers and alleged failure to include health warnings on information the company was required to provide to its workers. Other alleged violations included failing to list suspected carcinogens on safety sheets provided to workers, overexposing workers to asbestos and failure to provide workers with gloves impervious to a hazardous chemical used on the fighter. The proposed fine follows a highly publicized <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspection that followed numerous complaints from workers at the plant, which employs about 14,000 people. In October, a month after the inspection began, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizendine </PERSON>, the president of the division, said: `` We have seen nothing to indicate the materials we work with are fundamentally unsafe of pose a health hazard provided proper procedures are followed.'' A month later, the government for the first time publicly acknowledged the existence of the stealth fighter, a single-seat, dual-engine jet that resembles a bat and is formally designated the F-117A. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has ordered 59 stealth fihters; 52 had been delivered as of the November announcement. The fighter uses so-called stealth technology to help it evade enemy radar, including radar-absorbing materials and other coatings. Seventy-five employees at the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> plant have a suit pending against <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and companies that make and supply the chemicals used to help the fighter avoid radar detection. More than 100 workers have filed workers compensation claims alleging they suffer from injuries caused by the chemicals. The suit and the claims allege composite materials used in the fighter and chemicals used to mill and clean those materials cause rashes, nausea, dizziness, memory loss and concentration problems. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said the $ 1.49 million fine represented the ninth-largest in the agency's 17-year history and the largest ever levied in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The record fine was $ 5.1 million against two companies involved in an April 1987 <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, building collapse.

 With a few days remaining before he begins work as the new head of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> was said to be absorbed in learning about his new company and analysts suggested he would take office ready to sell some of the tobacco and food giant's assets. <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>, who takes over as chairman and chief executive officer of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> April 3, has not said what his specific plans are for the company, recently acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 24.53 billion, the largest debt-financed takeover in history. But analysts say <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>, who is leaving as president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to head <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, probably will decide to sell some of the company's brands to raise money to help pay off the debt, including $ 3 billion in annual interest payments, picked up by <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> with the acquisition. `` I think that's very much the case,'' said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` That, I think, is in the forefront -LRB- to reduce the debt -RRB- ... to sell for as much as you can as quickly as you can.'' Layoffs are possible but not certain, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> said. Personnel moves could come after <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s divestiture _ with the new owners of whatever divisions are sold making the decisions, he said. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary, announced last week that about 700 employees will be offered early retirement enhancements or cash incentives to leave their jobs voluntarily. But the move to cut the workforce stemed from the failure of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s smokeless cigarettes, not the <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> takeover. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> assets likely for sale _ including <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> and Planters-Life Savers _ are attractive holdings. `` Look at the cookies, the crackers, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON>, Planters, <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION>. This is not so bad. You have the creme de la creme of some of the business,'' he said. `` I do n't think they'll know what they'll end up selling until they see what their actual value is,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> added. <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> has retained <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly to study a possible sale of the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON>. On March 13, the day <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> announced his appointment, <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> said his new job was `` the greatest challenge in corporate America.'' Since then, the native of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has declined requests for interviews. <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said, `` For the time being, he's up to his eyeballs in <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> immersion. He's going to take a month or two to get settled and learn more about the company's operations.'' <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>, at this point, wo n't publicly reveal his vision for the company, Ms. <PERSON> Howes </PERSON> said. Financial concerns aside, asset sales are considered likely because the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> required some as part of the regulatory approval process for the takeover. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, responsible for preventing monopolies by enforcing antitrust laws, said it would not challenge the takeover if <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> within a year sells: _ The Chun King oriental food line of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choy </ORGANIZATION> line of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> _ The Planters nuts line of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> or the Fisher nuts line of <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> _ <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> ketchup or <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s Hunt ketchup The commission said unless those units were divested, the combined market share could result in unfair consumer pricing. Together, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s prior holdings account for one-eighth of the food sold in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supermarkets. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said there is no doubt the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> directive will be followed, but he said the specific items named by the government do not amount to a major portion of the company's business. <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> replaces the aggressive, flamboyant CEO <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> after losing to <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> in the high-stakes takeover battle. <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>, 47, hugely successful during his 11 years at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, has been described as a methodical executive unafraid of shaking up a company. He reportedly will start at <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> with a $ 2.3 million annual salary and has received a signing bonus of more than $ 10 million. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, a tobacco industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said that <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> is coming into a company that already is `` very well run'' and he should not face any immediate crises. `` <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has a lot of experience in the food area,'' he added. `` It's not new to them, though it's new to him -LRB- <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> -RRB-. I'm sure he'll zero in and try to maximize his opportunities.'' Other analysts have said <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>'s immediate tasks include giving <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> employees a firm sense of direction in the wake of last year's bruising takeover fight and reversing the company's loss, over the last few years, of its share of the domestic tobacco market If <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> sells some food lines, tobacco will become even more important because it will command a larger chunk of the company's earnings, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Currently, tobacco accounts for about two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> income. Also on the horizon could be a move of the company's headquarters from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> A relocation to <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s former home in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, has been rumored for months. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> moved <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, its home for more than 100 years, to suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1987.

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant with 21 years' experience has her own plan to get striking employees back to work. <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Watkinsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, is filing a motion asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to appoint a supplemental trustee to run the airline and to allow workers to return immediately at reduced pay. The motion, which her attorney husband <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> sent to the court on Thursday, suggests that thousands of striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees want to return to work, as long as it's not for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> `` Even though they're frustrated not working, they'd rather be frustrated than working for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday. Under <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>' plan, if the court appointed a trustee to run the airline instead of <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent carrier, workers could return at 75 percent of pre-strike pay. The remaining 25 percent of their pay would accrue until <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> reorganized under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. `` I was sort of frustrated by nothing happening in the case. She was too,'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. `` Everyone was trying to do something to help the attorneys and the investment bankers. But no one wants to do anything for the employees. They want to go back to work.'' Eastern's Machinists struck the carrier March 4 and pilots and flight attendants are honoring the walkout. The airline sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors on March 9. Eastern's pilots and Machinists already have asked Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> to appoint a trustee to run the airline's day-to-day operations, removing company management from that role A clerk for <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said Friday that she was unaware of the <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> motion. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said his wife was filing as a creditor owed $ 858.21 in back pay. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has scheduled an April 7 hearing on the pilots' trustee request. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said he hoped to bring a busload of employees from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to attend the hearing, at which he expects his motion to be heard. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, who lives in a town with a population of 2,000 about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, admitted that a motion by one employee was a tiny cry in proceedings dominated by powerful union and corporate players. `` It's highly unusual,'' he said. `` This is an unusual case anyway. We though it was worth a shot. It was definitely in the public interest.''

<HEAD>Uproar Over FSX Reflects Tougher Attitudes Toward Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American opinion leaders who favor a more nationalist trade policy have found a cause celebre in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to share <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter aircraft technology with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Opposition to the FSX fighter deal has galvanized lawmakers, executives, academics and others who say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should discard its devotion to free trade and adopt Japanese-style measures. For a change, opposition to aspects of the jet fighter deal have come not only from lobbyists and think tankers, but from prominent figures in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own administration, including <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. The ferocity of the FSX debate marks it as a turning point in American attitudes toward competition with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ reshaped by the persistent trade deficit and rivalries in semiconductors, high-definition television and superconductivity. `` There is no doubt that the FSX issue is important, in that it's the first evidence that some elements of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government are starting to come to grips intellectually with the challenge of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a professor of Asian studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> `` For the first time in the postwar world, instead of trying make the Japanese look like us, we are behaving ever so slightly like the Japanese,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Under the agreement signed late last year, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would join forces with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to develop and produce the FSX, an advanced version of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighter. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week said he endorsed the deal, but agreed to insist on modifications to safeguard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology and assure <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry has a share in the plane's production. Some opponents say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should simply buy F-16s, which would be cheaper for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and help shrink the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has refused to do that, but only because it was not pushed to the limit, they say. So far the debate has n't led to bitter displays of emotion, like last year's fury over <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s illegal sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which led congressmen to smash <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> radios outside the Capitol. But as with any good rallying issue, the FSX reflects bigger concerns, including the loss of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s high-technology leadership and the dominance of military considerations in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy. `` There's a sense of frustration in the country,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, editor of `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Bashing Alert,'' which tracks comments about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1,500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publications on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Dentsu </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's largest advertising agency. `` The aerospace is such a sensitive issue because it's the last industry which we can safely say we still dominate,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the seismic change in opinion has split the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial interests, apart from the State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> departments, which put global security issues first. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s star is slowly rising, although the adjustment `` is still lagging behind events,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preeg </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A leader in the fight against the FSX, <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, gave intellectual respectability to the cause of managed trade last year in a book called `` Trading Places: How We Allowed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to Take the Lead.'' <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiator, compared Americans to lonesome cowboys and Japanese to settlers: `` Under attack they circle the wagons together and take on all comers. And win.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not be a free trader when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> blocks advanced American products from its own market while developing competing products of its own, as in the case of supercomputers, some of the new interventionists say. `` We must begin to act like we were a developing nation,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON>, a professor of strategic management at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our false pride continues to make us ethnocentric about where ideas come from.'' In contrast to those who fear foreign investment, Ms. <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON> said she favors it as long as Americans benefit with good jobs. `` We want the critical tasks done on American soil, so Americans, I do n't care who they work for, manage to keep themselves on the cutting edge,'' she said. `` In time of war, we -LRB- could -RRB- exercise our sovereign control over property.'' All this talk of managed trade and industrial policy troubles free traders such as <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgins </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growth </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There is no way we could set up that sort of a management system in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It's a very fierce, aggressive, no-holds-barred competition of special interest groups here. We do not have a sort of consensus culture as they do in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hudgins </PERSON> said. But even <PERSON> Hudgins </PERSON> sees some Japanese things worth emulating. He favors repealing most antitrust laws, eliminating taxes on earned interest income to encourage savings, and breaking down the distinction between commercial and investment banks.

 If it worked for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employees figured, it might work for them too. So one day earlier this month, booming over the speakers in the lunchroom at <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s film plant in <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, came the company's new fight song. `` Used to have it all,'' it goes. `` But one man has come. He wants to break up what we've done. Cut out the heart, and take the money and run.'' While that `` one man'' remained nameless in the song, his identity was no mystery to anyone at the instant-camera giant. The clear villain of the piece was <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company that launched a hostile takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> last July. It appeared this past week the takeover battle might be over. Unable to defeat <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s defensive strategy in court, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> said it was selling its stock under a <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> share buyback plan. But <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> did n't say it was giving up. Although <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> is owned by the family of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, nephew of the late <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, it was Gold, a 46-year-old Hollywood entertainment lawyer turned takeover specialist, who came to personify the threat to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> workers. As the eight-month-old takeover battle became increasingly bitter, preoccupying top executives and filling the rank-and-file with apprehension, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> workers united passionately in opposition to <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> and Gold. Nearly 6,000 of the company's 8,300 employees in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> signed petitions against the takeover. The Employees Committee, a 32-member group elected to represent workers, was solidly behind <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s current chief executive, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacAllister </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>. `` Basically, it comes down to this,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquarosa </PERSON>. `` We do n't want anything to do with <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> said the personality of its president is irrelevant. `` Making it personal _ that's a public relations maneuver to obscure the issues,'' said <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldi </PERSON>. `` You create a straw man so everyone focuses on that instead of on the poor management of Polaroid.'' Yet the employee campaign against Gold, if it was one, was so homespun it belied a Madison Avenue effort. The not-exactly-catchy fight song, for example, was recorded by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, a 40-year-old Polaroid lab technician who `` played a little guitar in the'60s'' but has n't done much musically since. While he got lots of help from his wife, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, their two children and friends, <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> did n't contribute a dime. What's more, he admitted, he dreamed up the song mainly to give his 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, a boost toward a singing career. `` I just thought it might get her some exposure,'' he said. Employee attitudes have been an important element in the battle for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, because they were also stockholders, controlling nearly 14 percent of the company's stock through an employee stock ownership plan. Their attitudes were clear. Throughout its <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> headquarters and manufacturing plants, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employees wore or hawked $ 10 T-shirts. They come in a choice of six colors, but all bore the same message: `` Polaroid Family Says No To Stanley.'' At the headquarters, four beige brick buildings around a courtyard called Technology Square, one of the most popular gathering places was a bulletin board with the latest news Wall Street takeover battles, including <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s. Librarian <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON>, who posted the clippings each day, said the most sought-after books in the corporate library were also about high finance, reflecting `` a tremendous thirst'' in employees to understand what was happening to them. Rather than an orchestrated campaign, <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> believed the anger toward Gold results from employees' attempts to put the conflict into comprehensible terms. `` We know it's not just one man, because the same thing is happening to other companies,'' he said. `` But we see our jobs threatened, the company we have built threatened, and he is the one we blame.'' End Adv for Sunday March 26

<HEAD>Formica Corp. Says Its Offered $20 Cash Per Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, facing a bevy of buyout offers, announced Thursday it received a $ 256 million bid that tops a $ 230.4 million tender offer from a management-led group. Formica officials declined to identify the company that made the latest, $ 20-per-share cash offer, but said <PERSON> Formica </PERSON>'s committee of independent directors instructed <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to begin negotiations with the company. Last fall, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, businessman offered $ 20 a share in cash and securities for <PERSON> Formica </PERSON> and was rebuffed. After the management group announced its offer, <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said he was considering a new bid. However it was not known if the latest bid was from <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also is continuing discussions with six other interested third parties, <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Way </PERSON> said. The management group, <ORGANIZATION> FM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has offered $ 18 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures laminated products used in kitchen countertops, tables and cabinets. <PERSON> Formica </PERSON> has said its directors have approved a definitive merger with FM, but they also told <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> to see if others might be interested in bidding. <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> stock fell $ 1 a share to $ 21 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Wednesday. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, who owns television stations, nursing homes and real estate, dropped his bid in November after <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Langone </PERSON> _ who heads the management group _ said the company was n't for sale. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> sold his 1.09 million-share stake in <LOCATION> Formica </LOCATION> last November to <ORGANIZATION> Chicago-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It is not known if he owns any <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> shares.
